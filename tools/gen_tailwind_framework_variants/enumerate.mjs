/*
 * Ask the real Tailwind engine which variants the framework registers, and under which order
 * numbers.
 *
 * This is the static half of the variant component, and it is the half `gen_tailwind_variant`
 * deliberately does not print. That tool captures the *behaviour* — `getVariantOrder` and
 * `getClassOrder` over a corpus — into a fixture a test reads. This one captures the *registry*
 * into shipped Go, because `LoadDesignSystem` needs it at lint time and a fixture under `testdata`
 * is not shipped.
 *
 * # Why the registry can be a table when the order map cannot
 *
 * `variant.go` argues at length that no static table can hold a variant's *position*, and it is
 * right: `getVariantOrder` assigns a dense index per run over only the variants that were parsed,
 * so `hover` is 0 in one run and 1 in another. Nothing here contradicts that. What is captured is
 * the *registration* — the name, the `order` number `Variants.set` assigned, and the kind — which
 * is a fact about the installed framework and does not vary per run or per repository. The dense
 * index is still computed per class list, from these registrations, by `BuildVariantOrder`.
 *
 * The distinction is the same one `CollapseFamilies` rests on: a fact about roots is a table, a
 * computation per class is code.
 *
 * # What is captured, and what cannot be
 *
 * `entries` is every registered root with its order and kind. `compareFnOrders` is which order
 * numbers carry a comparison function. The function itself cannot cross this boundary — it is a
 * closure over the design system's theme — so the Go side registers `CompareBreakpoints` against
 * those orders, reading the *live* theme. That is not a shortcut. Redefining `--breakpoint-sm` to
 * `200rem` moves `sm` from index 0 to index 4 on the engine, measured, so a comparison that read a
 * hardcoded scale would be wrong on exactly the repository that customized its breakpoints.
 *
 * The directions are captured rather than assumed: this script probes each grouped order with two
 * of its own members and reports whether the engine ordered them ascending or descending, so a
 * Tailwind release that flipped one produces a diff rather than a silent reversal.
 *
 * `@plugin` and `@config` are stubbed, matching the sibling generators. A JavaScript plugin can
 * call `addVariant`, so a repository with one registers a root this enumeration does not see. That
 * is a stated narrowing: this table is the *framework's* registrations, and a repository's own
 * contributions stay live-loaded through `@custom-variant`.
 *
 * # The optional design system argument, and why it had to exist
 *
 * The second argument is a CSS entry point to read the registry from, defaulting to a bare
 * `@import "tailwindcss"`. Without it this script had no way to load a repository's stylesheet at
 * all, which meant the invariance claim in the generated file named a comparison the tool could not
 * perform: every "independent generation" was the same framework `index.css` parsed again, and a
 * set of readings that cannot differ cannot detect a table that varies.
 *
 * With a real entry point the comparison is real, and measured it holds: the 88 registrations are
 * identical across ahra, www-connected-app, www-phi-health, an independent design system sharing no
 * submodule, and a bare install. The mechanism is `Variants.set` assigning kind onto an existing
 * record without touching `order`, so a repository redefining `dark` moves nothing, while a
 * `@custom-variant` under a new name appends. Both halves were probed rather than assumed.
 *
 * Node is required to run this and never to use its result.
