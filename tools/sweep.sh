# A mutation sweep proves a fixture set can see. The failure it cannot see is its own: a replacement
# that matched nothing produces a mutant identical to the original, the suite passes, and that reads
# exactly like a surviving mutant that the fixtures are blind to. No error, no empty output, no
# friction. The probe ran perfectly against the wrong object.
#
# That happened twice in this project on one day, in two nodes that had not spoken. A rule file was
# indented one level deeper than its sibling so a replacement silently matched nothing, and a
# research pass counted the wrong diagnostic marker across 844 of 867 upstream snapshots and read the
# silence as a clean corpus.
#
# So this refuses to report a score until it has proven the input was real. The byte comparison is
# the half that a known-dirty control sails straight past, because a control proves the harness can
# fail while saying nothing about whether this particular edit landed.

#
# The cost is real and has to be stated: a scoped run cannot see a guard living in another package.
# A mutation renaming a rule reads as a survivor under scoping, because the parity guard that would
# catch it is in internal/registry. So a scoped sweep measures the rule's own fixtures and nothing
# else, and anything relying on a cross-package guard needs an unscoped run to score.
