// Command vendor_react_fixtures re-pulls React's error-named compiler fixtures at a chosen commit.
//
// The corpus under `internal/react_conformance/testdata/fixtures` is vendored rather than fetched at
// test time, so this tool is what makes the pin reproducible: it is how the vendored tree was
// produced and how it gets moved to a new sha. It writes nothing unless every count it expects
// holds, because the whole value of a vendored corpus is that a human can review the diff, and a
// diff produced by a partial fetch is a review of the wrong thing.
//
// # The counting trap this tool is built around
//
// The research pass this corpus comes from reported 221 error fixtures. The real number is 325. The
// cause was a grep anchored at the fixture root, which excluded the nine subdirectories that hold
// 103 of them — wrong by a third, and it read exactly like a clean result. It was caught only
// because a parallel investigation returned a different number.
//
// So this tool does not filter by path prefix at any point. It walks the full tree, keys fixtures
// by their path relative to the fixture root, and reports the top-level and nested split separately
// so the number that moved last time is visible rather than summed away.
//
// # Why the git-tree API and not the contents API
//
// The GitHub contents API caps at 1,000 entries and silently repeats pages rather than erroring,
// which produced a plausible-but-wrong file count during the research pass. The git-tree API with
// `recursive=1` reports `truncated`, and this tool refuses to proceed when it is true. That check
// is the difference between a measurement and a guess.
//
//	go run ./tools/vendor_react_fixtures -sha <commit> -out internal/react_conformance/testdata/fixtures
//
// Pass -dry-run to report the counts without writing.

// and reads as success. The clean fixtures are the only population where silence is the right answer
// and firing is a defect, so a run that quietly collects none restores exactly the blind spot this
// change exists to close -- and it would report success while doing it.
//
// The exact count also guards a failure a nonzero check cannot see. Collecting fixtures by copying
// them into one directory loses any whose basenames collide, and four of these do:
// `optional-member-expression-as-memo-dep.js` and three siblings appear in more than one
// subdirectory. That collection lost four, returned 66, and errored on nothing. A guard asserting
