/*
 * The engine side of the Tier 2 differential: `{order, count}` for every class, on every design
 * system, as the shipped Tailwind computes it.
 *
 * This is not another component fixture. Six components already carry their own engine-verified
 * corpora and each of those hands Go a value it has already decoded: `descriptor_fixtures.json`
 * supplies a parsed `{kind, root, value, modifier}` and asks only whether `Table.Lookup` maps it to
 * the right reading. That is the right shape for testing a lookup and it cannot see the seam. A
 * class is a *string*, and turning the string into the candidate is `ParseCandidate`'s job, so a
 * suite that starts from a candidate has tested both halves and never the join between them.
 *
 * `segment` is the recorded precedent: it was verified exclusively through `InferDataType`, which
 * launders its errors, and mutations to it changed nothing observable. A component reachable only
 * through its caller is not tested, and neither is a *seam* reachable only through a fixture that
 * has already crossed it.
 *
 * So this file captures the one thing no component fixture can: the class name, and the answer.
 * What happens in between is entirely the Go side's problem, which is the point.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   node tools/gen_tailwind_classorder/enumerate.mjs <systems.json>
 *
 * Writes the fixture to stdout and its progress to stderr.

 * The registry, expanded.

 * the descriptor model's third axis is the modifier, with three states rather than two, and a
 * registry enumerated without them exercises exactly one of the three. So a class advertising
 * modifiers contributes the bare class plus one sample per axis.
 *
 * Sampled rather than exhausted on purpose. A colour utility advertises every theme key as a
 * modifier and the cross product runs to millions, none of which say anything the three axes do not:
 * `/25`, `/[0.5]` and `/[var(--a)]` are one bucket, measured in Phase 0. The three probes chosen
 * here are one per bucket, and the bucket boundary is the thing under test.
 *
 * Expanding the modifiers is also what makes the registry a population with nulls in it. The bare
 * registry has none by construction, every entry being a class the engine advertised, and the
 * documented null figure therefore had to come from the corpus. Advertised modifiers are not the
 * same guarantee: `border` advertises modifiers and `border/50` compiles to nothing, 30 classes per
 * system doing this. The engine advertises a modifier it then refuses, so the expanded registry
 * carries the case a differential must not score as agreement — in the population where nobody

 * The divergence assertion, and the axis it turned out to live on.
 *
 * `f7d1d8d` is the commit to copy: it took the claim the whole port rests on and made it an
 * assertion that fails if it ever becomes trivially true. The claim is that a table generated from
 * one repository is wrong for another, and this measures where that is true.
 *
 * It is not where reading the theme result suggests. Theme resolution diverges on *values*: 744
 * entries against 748, with 22 shared keys carrying different values. A reading is `{order, count}`,
 * and order is the index of the declared *property*, so a shared class declaring the same property
 * with a different value reads identically in both. Measured: 95,134 classes are in both registries
 * and every one of them reads the same.
 *
 * The divergence is in *membership*. 462 registry classes exist in exactly one of the two systems,
 * because a `--color-brand-*` token in one repository's `@theme` is what makes `accent-brand` a
 * class at all. A table generated against ahra has no row that answers `accent-brand`, so it
 * declines a class the engine compiles, which is a silent-side defect rather than a wrong reading.
 *
 * That is the sharper claim and it is the one asserted: both axes are recorded, so a future Tailwind
 * that starts diverging readings shows up as a number moving off zero rather than as a fixture that
 * quietly still passes.
