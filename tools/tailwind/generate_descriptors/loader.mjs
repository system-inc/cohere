/*
 * What this design system registers that a bare Tailwind install does not.
 *
 * The volume assertions cannot answer this on their own, and that is the gap they were found to
 * have. Tailwind registers its built-in utility roots from JavaScript rather than from CSS, so a
 * stylesheet importing nothing but the framework still produces 23,286 registry classes, 1,154
 * utility roots and 419 theme keys, and every floor written to catch a loader that returned an
 * empty system is cleared comfortably. Measured, not assumed: `@import "tailwindcss" source(none);`
 * passed all six assertions before this existed.
 *
 * The delta is what discriminates, and it is counted rather than named. A hardcoded canary
 * (`fade-in` exists on ahra, `brand-hover` on connected) is the same baked-in assumption the check
 * is meant to catch, one repository's tokens standing in for a claim about any repository: it
 * cannot travel, and it goes quiet the day someone renames the utility. Comparing against a live
 * bare install asks the question directly, in whatever repository it runs, and needs no maintenance
 * when the framework's own population moves.
 *
 * The baseline is built through the same borrowed install as the system under test, so the two
 * populations come from one engine. Differencing against a different Tailwind version would
 * attribute that version's own additions to the repository, which is the error this is here to
 * prevent, pointing the other way.
