// Command generate_framework_variants prints the framework's variant registrations into shipped Go.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./tools/tailwind/generate_framework_variants -package-root <tailwindcss package> [-output <file.go>] [-check]
//
// The table it writes is what lets `LoadDesignSystem` build a registry that knows `hover`. Without
// it a run-scoped design system registers only the repository's own `@custom-variant` names —
// measured on this repository, one registration against the engine's 88 — and the consequence is
// not degraded ranking but refusal to parse: `ParseVariant` returns nil for an unregistered root
// and `ParseCandidate` then yields zero candidates for the whole class. Every rule reading it would
// decline on every class carrying a variant, and a differential would score that as agreement
// because both sides went silent.
//
// # Why this is a table when the variant *order* is not
//
// `variant.go` argues that no static table can hold a variant's position, and nothing here
// contradicts it. `getVariantOrder` assigns a dense index per run over only the variants that were
// parsed, so `hover` is 0 in one run and 1 in another, and that computation stays in
// `BuildVariantOrder`. What this table holds is the *registration*: the name, the order number
// `Variants.set` assigned, and the kind. Those are facts about the installed framework.
//
// The shipped `VariantOrder` in property_order_table.go is the shape being argued against and is a
// different thing again: it is keyed on composed prefixes like `group-hover:`, which have no
// position of their own. This table is keyed on registration roots, which is what the engine
// actually registers.
//
// # The invariance measurement this table rests on, and the one it used to claim
//
// A table claiming to describe Tailwind while actually holding one repository's tokens is the bug
// the whole port exists to remove, so the claim has to be measured rather than assumed. It was not.
// The header this generator wrote said the table had been verified against "each repository's own
// `theme.css` loaded through its own install", and no such load was possible: `enumerate.mjs` took
// a package root, built every design system from the literal string `@import "tailwindcss";`, and
// never opened a repository stylesheet. The four "independent generations" were one framework
// `index.css` read four times, and readings that cannot differ cannot detect a table that varies.
// The two repositories named also vendor the same Structure submodule, so even a real comparison
// between them would have measured a shared dependency rather than framework invariance.
//
// Re-measured with `-design-system`, which is the argument that had to exist first, the claim
// holds and holds more broadly than was claimed: 88 registrations with identical names, orders and
// kinds across ~/Projects/ahra, ~/Projects/connected/www-connected-app, ~/Projects/phi/www-phi-health,
// an independent design system sharing no submodule with any of them, and a bare install.
//
// The mechanism, probed rather than assumed. Every corpus repository declares
// `@custom-variant dark` and it does not appear as a difference, because `Variants.set` assigns
// kind and applyFn onto an existing record and never touches `order`: redefining a framework
// variant changes the selector it emits without moving where it sorts. Only a `@custom-variant`
// under a *new* name appends a position. A planted system declaring `dark` plus two new names put
// those two at orders 83 and 84, moved no framework registration, and is what proves the zero above
// came from an instrument that can move.
//
// `-verify-invariance-against` makes that measurement repeatable, and a run that skips it says so
// in the file it writes.
//
// # What crosses this boundary and what cannot
//
// The comparison functions do not. Each is a closure over the design system's theme, and four
// order numbers carry one in a default build. The generated file records which orders carry one and
// in which direction; `LoadDesignSystem` registers `CompareBreakpoints` against them, reading the
// *live* theme. That distinction is load-bearing and measured: redefining `--breakpoint-sm` to
// `200rem` moves `sm` from dense index 0 to index 4 on the engine, so a comparison closed over a
// hardcoded scale would be wrong on exactly the repository that customized its breakpoints.
//
// The directions are probed rather than read off `variants.ts`, so a release that flipped one
// produces a diff here instead of a silent reversal of every breakpoint-bearing class.
//
// `-check` regenerates and fails when the committed table disagrees, which is what makes a Tailwind
// upgrade that registers a new variant show up as a failing gate rather than as a rule that quietly
// stops parsing classes using it. Like the sibling tools/tailwind/generate_* tools, nothing invokes it
// automatically; it is a manual gate.
//
// Node is required to run it and never to use the result.
