/*
 * Capture how the engine resolves a functional candidate's value, before any handle body runs.
 *
 * The Go port of `functionalUtility` in `internal/tailwind/functionalutility.go` is checked against
 * these resolutions rather than against a reading of the TypeScript, for the reason every other
 * tools/tailwind/generate_* tool exists: the two are different claims and they disagree where a careful reader
 * would not predict.
 *
 * # The claim this tool makes, and the weaker one it does not
 *
 * The resolved value is an intermediate. Upstream computes it inside a closure and hands it straight
 * to `desc.handle`, so nothing public returns it and there is no `resolveValue(candidate)` to call.
 * What is observable is the declarations a class compiles to, which is the resolved value after a
 * handler has already used it.
 *
 * So this measures resolution through its effect and says so rather than implying it read the
 * intermediate. For a root whose handler is the identity on its value, which most are, the resolved
 * value appears verbatim in the emitted declaration. For a root that wraps it, it appears wrapped,
 * consistently, so a port that resolves differently produces a different string in the same place.
 *
 * The strongest signal here is the rejections. A branch that must produce nothing is unambiguous:
 * `bg/50`, `w-[3px]/50` and `grow-2/3` compile to no CSS at all, and a port that resolves them to
 * something would emit a declaration where the engine emits none. Those cases carry the test.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   node tools/tailwind/generate_functional/enumerate.mjs <theme.css> [--resolve-root <dir>] > functional.json
