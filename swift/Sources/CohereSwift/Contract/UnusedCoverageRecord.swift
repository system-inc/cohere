/*
 What one `--unused` analysis looked at, with the population beside the result, so a report that checked
 nothing never reads like a report that found nothing.

 `filesNotChecked` counts files by why the index could not vouch for them: a file the build has not compiled
 as it stands, a file with `#if` (the index describes one configuration), a file with a reference no module
 claims. `skipped` counts what is never reported by design, such as an `@_exported` import, which is API.
