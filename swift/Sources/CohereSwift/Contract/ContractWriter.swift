 Writes records to the front door, one JSON object per line, and keeps the counts the summary must agree
 with.

 The front door refuses a summary whose finding count disagrees with the findings it received, or a run
 missing a phase record. Rather than trust every call site to keep those numbers straight, the writer
 counts what actually went out and builds the summary from that, so the engine cannot contradict itself
 in a way only the front door would catch.
