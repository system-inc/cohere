/*
 The package as SwiftPM sees it: its root targets, what kind each is, which Swift files each compiles,
 and the language mode each compiles in.

 Read from SwiftPM rather than from a walk of the directory, so a file belongs to the run because a
 target compiles it, never because it happens to sit under `Sources/`.

 Local packages the root depends on by path, and that live inside the root's own directory, are loaded
 too: ahraos-presence's `Libraries/VRMKit` is a fork we own and format as ours, and leaving it out would
 call Presence clean while a fifth of its Swift went unread. Whether such a package is ours or vendored
 is the file set's decision, not this model's. Remote dependencies are never loaded.

 Two commands, because neither holds everything: `describe` gives each target's kind and resolved
 sources, and `dump-package` gives the settings, which is the only place a target's
 `swiftLanguageMode` appears. Both run against the engine's own scratch path, never the project's
 `.build`, so a run never contends on SwiftPM's lock with the developer's build and `--no-fix` writes
 nothing to the project.
