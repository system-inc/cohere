/*
 What `swift package describe` and `dump-package` said last time, kept in the engine's scratch so a warm
 run does not ask again. Asking costs 1.7s on ahraos-macos and 3.4s on ahraos-presence, warm, on every run,
 and the answer changes only when the package does.

 The answer depends on three things, and the entry holds a fingerprint of each:

 - the toolchain, since a new SwiftPM can describe the same package differently;
 - every owned `Package.swift` and the root's `Package.resolved`, by content;
 - the shape of every target's directory. `describe` resolves a target's sources from the disk, so adding,
   removing or renaming a file changes its answer while the manifest stays the same. Each of those changes
   the modification time of the directory holding the file, and editing a file's contents changes neither
   the directory nor the answer, so the entry records every directory under each target with its time.

 Any difference, a missing entry, or an entry that does not decode means describing cold. A cache that
 kept answering after the package changed would check the wrong files and still print a verdict, which is
 the stale-cache failure `internal/types/program/incremental.go` warns about, so the test that matters is
 warm-after-a-change (`PackageDescriptionCacheTests`).
