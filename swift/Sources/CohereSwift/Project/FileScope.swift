 Which of our files this run is about: all of them, or the ones named on the command line.

 A narrowed scope narrows fix, format and lint. It never narrows types: in Swift a change in one file
 changes what the rest of its module means, and the compiler checks the whole module regardless, so the
 types phase always reports the whole package and the coverage line says so.
