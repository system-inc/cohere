 Runs a tool (`swift`, `git`) and hands back everything it said.

 Output goes to temporary files rather than pipes. A pipe holds about 64 KB, and a process that fills it
 blocks until someone reads; reading only after the process exits then waits forever. `swift package
 describe` on a large package passes that size, and a hang there would look like a slow build rather
 than a bug.
