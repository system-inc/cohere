/*
 Which of the package's Swift files this run treats as ours, and why each of the others is not.

 A file is ours when a target of the package, or of a local package inside it that is not vendored,
 compiles it, and git does not ignore it. A generated file is ours too: Kirk's convention (2026-10-03,
 shared with TypeScript) names it `*.generated.swift` and gives it every rule and the formatter, exempting
 it only from max-file-lines, by that name. What git ignores is read from the ignore files themselves
 (`IgnoreRules`), with no git process, and it includes untracked files that are not ignored. A new file someone is still writing is exactly the one a gate must see, and TypeScript's program
 already includes it, because a tsconfig reads the disk rather than the index.

 Every file a target compiles and this run does not check is listed with a reason, so the coverage line
 can say what was left out rather than letting a smaller number pass for a complete one.
