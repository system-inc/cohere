 No trusting what URLSession returned without asking whether the request succeeded:

     let (data, _) = try await session.data(for: request)
     return try JSONDecoder().decode(Profile.self, from: data)

 URLSession throws only when no response arrives at all. A 401, a 404 or a 500 is a response like any other, so
 its body (an error page, a JSON error envelope) comes back as the data, and code that decodes it, returns it or
 caches it treats the failure as the answer: an error object decoded into a model that happens to accept it, an
 image cache storing a 404 page, a POST reported as saved when the server refused it. The repair casts the
 response to `HTTPURLResponse` and reads `statusCode` before the body is trusted, and throws or returns the
 failure when it is not a success.

 It ports `nexus/correctness-require-response-status-check`, whose definitions it keeps one for one:
 - Which calls are tracked. The TypeScript rule tracks the platform's `fetch` and Structure's
   `networkService.request`, decided by the declaration the call resolves to. Here it is URLSession, decided the
   same way, through the index the build wrote: the async methods Foundation's Swift extension declares on
   `NSURLSession` (`data(for:)`, `data(from:)`, `upload(for:from:)`, `upload(for:fromFile:)`, `bytes(for:)`,
   `bytes(from:)`, `download(for:)`, `download(from:)`, `download(resumeFrom:)`, each with its `delegate:`, matched
   by the symbol up to the declaration's full name), and the Objective-C methods that take a completion handler
   (`dataTask`, `uploadTask` and `downloadTask` with `completionHandler:`). A method of ours with the same name
   resolves to ours and is never tracked, whatever its receiver is called.
 - What the TypeScript rule calls the Response is here a pair. `let (data, response) = try await <tracked call>`,
   a `let` whose pattern is a two-element tuple of names or `_`, plays the part of the TypeScript `const`, and the
   completion handler's first two parameters (named, or `$0` and `$1`) play the part of the `.then` callback's
   one parameter. Swift hands the body over already read, so where the TypeScript rule waits for `.json()` or
   `.text()`, here any use of the first element (the `Data`, the `AsyncBytes`, the downloaded file's `URL`) is the
   body read: decoding it, returning it, passing it on, iterating it, reading `.count`. Two uses are not, because
   they read none of it: binding it in a condition (`guard let data`, `if let data = data`), which makes the new
   name the body, and comparing it with `nil`. The completion handler's body arrives optional, and asking whether
   it arrived is not trusting it.
 - What counts as checking is the second element, read as the TypeScript rule reads the Response. A read of
   `statusCode` is a check, wherever it is (in a condition, a log line, a thrown error), because reading more as a
   check can only silence a site. The status lives on `HTTPURLResponse`, so a cast of the response to it
   (`as?`, `as!`, through parentheses and optional chaining) is followed: `(response as? HTTPURLResponse)?.statusCode`
   is a check, and a cast bound to a name (`if let http = response as? HTTPURLResponse`, `guard let`, a plain
   `let`) makes that name the response. `url`, `mimeType`, `expectedContentLength`, `textEncodingName`,
   `suggestedFilename`, `allHeaderFields` and a called `value(forHTTPHeaderField:)` are neutral, the counterpart of
   `.headers` and `.url`. Everything else is an escape and counts as a check, as it does there: passing the
   response to a function (`try validate(response)`), returning it, storing it, a cast to any other type, an `is`
   test, a comparison. The receiver may read the status, and proving that it does would mean following it, so the
   rule assumes it does.
 - On a path, through the enclosing function's control flow, exactly as the TypeScript rule decides it. A body read
   is reported when some path leaves the declaration, reaches the read, and goes on to a normal exit (falling off
   the end, or a `return`) or to the declaration again on the next turn of a loop, without a check or an escape
   anywhere along it. So checking after reading is checking (`let model = try decode(data)` then a `guard` on the
   status, then `return model`); a path that leaves by `throw` is not an exit, so reading the body to put it in a
   thrown error is not trusting it; and a check on one branch does not cover the other. The graph is laid out the
   way the TypeScript rule's is: the first `try` inside a `do` forks to its `catch` clauses (later ones reuse that
   fork, ESLint's approximation), a `throw` goes to the innermost `do` with `catch` clauses or leaves, a `guard`'s
   `else` never falls through, `fatalError` and `preconditionFailure` end their path, and a condition list fails
   at each element. `&&`, `||`, `??`, the ternary and optional chaining are laid out in source order rather than
   forked around the operand they may skip. That puts every event of the operand on the path, which can only add
   checks to it, so it can only silence a site; the misses it costs are listed below.
 - One rule Swift needs and TypeScript does not: the branch where a cast of the response to `HTTPURLResponse`
   bound in a condition fails counts as checked. URLSession answers every http and https request with an
   `HTTPURLResponse`, so that branch is a non-HTTP URL (a `file:` or `data:` one), which has no status to read.
   Without it, `if let http = response as? HTTPURLResponse, !(200..<300).contains(http.statusCode) { throw ... }`,
   the check AhraOs writes before its event stream, would read as unchecked on a branch that never runs.
 - The two other shapes it reports, as the TypeScript rule does. Discarded: `_ = try await session.data(for:)`, the
   call as a statement of its own, `let _ =` or `let (_, _) =`, a tracked pair neither of whose names is ever
   referenced, and a completion handler that names neither its body nor its response. Each throws the status away
   with the response. Read inline: `try await session.data(for: request).0` takes the body of a response nothing
   else can see.

 No fix: what a failure should do (throw, return nothing, retry, show the server's message) is the author's call.

 What it accepts as safe, and why: a status read on every path to the use (before it, or after it and before the
 function returns); the response handed to a helper, returned or stored (the escape above); `.1` read inline,
 which reads no body; a body read only on paths that throw; any call that is not URLSession's (a client of ours
 that already throws on a bad status is out by design, as `R2Api.signedS3Request` is for the TypeScript rule: a
 wrapper is a missed finding, never a false one). Every real site in AhraOs checks first and stays silent:
 `ProfileImageCache.swift:169` and `AhraOsHttpClient.swift:303` behind a `guard` or `if` on the cast and its
 status, and `AhraOsHttpClient.swift:455`, whose `bytes(for:)` stream is read inside a `Task`. ProviderProxy's
 `Task { try await session.bytes(for: urlRequest) }` hands the pair back through the task, so it is not tracked.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made and never one invented:
 - A pair any closure or `defer` refers to is dropped whole, as the TypeScript rule drops a binding a closure sees:
   the closure may run before the use or after it, and the graph of the enclosing function cannot say which. So
   AhraOs's event stream, consumed in a `Task`, would not be reported even without its check. Code the layout does
   not model (a statement inside `#if`, a switch with `#if` cases) is read the same way, and drops the pair too.
 - A pair bound any other way: `var (data, response)` (the TypeScript rule follows only `const`), a single name
   `let result = try await session.data(for:)` read as `result.0`, `async let`, a labeled tuple pattern, a pair
   laundered through a `Task`, a `TaskGroup` or a helper that returns it, and a completion handler that is not a
   closure literal (a method reference).
 - A producer of ours wrapping URLSession, Combine's `dataTaskPublisher`, the delegate-based tasks without a
   completion handler, and `URLSessionWebSocketTask`.
 - The call alone as the only statement of a body (`Task { try await session.data(for: request) }`), which Swift
   may read as the body's implicit return, so it is not counted as discarded.
 - The operand-order layout above: `if flag || http.statusCode == 200 { return data }` returns the body unchecked
   when `flag` is true, and reads as checked. So does a check inside a `case` pattern of an earlier `case` item.
 - Only the first `try` in a `do` forks to `catch`, so a decode that throws after an unchecked read and lands in a
   `catch` that returns normally is not reported. The TypeScript rule's ESLint layout misses it the same way, and
   on the paths it does not see the error body is never kept, only decoded and thrown away.
 - A reference the walk never reached drops its pair rather than being judged. That guard, like the TypeScript
   rule's, has no fixture that reaches it: every statement the layout does not model is walked as code it cannot
   place, which drops the pair already. It stays because an unplaced check is exactly what would make a silent site
   a false one.
