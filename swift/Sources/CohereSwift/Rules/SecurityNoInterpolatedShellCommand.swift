/*
 No value built into a shell's command string: `process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/bin/zsh")` with
 `process.arguments = ["-l", "-i", "-c", "cd \(projectRoot) && ahra os sleep"]`. The shell parses the whole string
 as code, the value included, so a space or a quote in `projectRoot` breaks the command and a `$(...)` or a
 backtick in it runs. Quoting the value by hand is one escape away from the same bug. The repair keeps the script
 literal and hands the value over as its own argument, after the script, where the shell reads it as `$1` and
 never parses it (`["-c", "cd \"$1\" && make", "zsh", path]`), or drops the shell and runs the program directly
 (`currentDirectoryURL` in place of the `cd`).

 It ports `nexus/security-no-interpolated-shell-command`, which judges a command string handed to node's
 `child_process` functions that run it through a shell. Swift has no function that adds a shell on its own, so
 the shell is always the program, chosen by name, and its `-c` operand is the command string. That is the shape
 the TypeScript rule leaves alone (`execFile('sh', ['-c', script])`, "a list rather than a type"); here it is the
 only shape there is, so the list is written down, and node's `shell: true` over an argument list has no Swift
 counterpart. The program is one of `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, `dash`, `ksh` or `mksh` by the last component of a
 literal path, given as a string or `URL(fileURLWithPath:)` or `URL(filePath:)`, directly or through a `let`. It
 is given with its arguments in one of two ways:
 - `receiver.arguments = [...]`, where `receiver.executableURL` or `receiver.launchPath` is set to the shell in
   the same statement list, and every such assignment to that receiver in the enclosing body names a shell (a
   `Process`, or anything spelled like one);
 - a call with an argument labeled `arguments` and another argument that is the shell
   (`Process.run(URL(fileURLWithPath: "/bin/zsh"), arguments: [...])`,
   `PaneProcessSpec(executable: "/bin/zsh", arguments: [...])`, a spawn request carrying both).
 The arguments are an array literal, directly or through a `let`. They are read the way the shell reads its
 own: literal options (`-l`, `-i`, `-lc`, `+o`, `-o NAME`, `--login`), and a `c` in a short cluster makes the
 first operand after them the command string. A non-literal element before the `c`, a non-literal one after it
 whose text starts like an option, or a long option the rule does not know, stops the reading and nothing is
 judged. Operands after the command string are the shell's `$0`, `$1` and on, data the shell never parses, so
 they are never judged.

 From there it is the TypeScript rule's judgement, piece for piece:
 - The command is built here: a string literal with an interpolation, a `+` concatenation, or a ternary with
   such a branch, through parentheses and `let` bindings. An opaque command (a parameter, a `var`, a call's
   result) is not judged: it may be a whole script its caller wrote as a literal, and nothing at this call says
   a value was spliced into it. So `PaneProcessSpec.interactiveClaude(command:)`, which passes its `command`
   straight to `-c`, is not flagged, as `execSync(command)` is not.
 - The command is flattened into the text the author wrote and the values spliced into it, through
   interpolations, `+` operands, and `let` bindings whose initializer is a literal, an interpolation, a
   concatenation, a ternary or another name. A quoted heredoc's body is data (`cat <<'EOSQL'` through
   `EOSQL`), so a value there is skipped, with the TypeScript rule's grammar and its one-way errors: a `<<` it
   cannot read declines the command, as does a ternary branch that may open one.
 - A value is unsafe when it is text that is not a literal, which is what the TypeScript rule's `string` is.
   Swift has no literal types, so a value is text only when the rule can show it: a non-literal operand of a
   `+` with a string literal among its operands (Swift adds nothing but text to a `String`); a name declared
   `String`, `Substring`, `Character` or `NSString` (or an optional of one), a `var` initialized with text, or a
   `let`, `if let` or `guard let` bound to such a value; `String(...)`; and a call or property whose
   declaration, read from the index the build wrote and demangled by the toolchain, gives one of those types,
   or that is one of `NSString`'s `stringBy` methods and properties, every one of which the SDK declares as
   returning `NSString`. A `let` bound to a literal is the literal's text, as a `const` is. A number, a `Bool`,
   or a name declared with one, is safe, as the TypeScript rule's `number` and `boolean` are.

 What it accepts as safe, and why: literal text, numbers and booleans (no shell syntax the author did not
 write), a value in a quoted heredoc's body (the shell expands nothing there), an opaque command (see above),
 and the operands after the command string (positional parameters, never parsed). A quoting helper is not one
 of them. The TypeScript rule reports a hand-escaped value on purpose, because the escape is a convention every
 call must repeat exactly and the fix makes it unnecessary, and a helper adds a reason of its own: whether an
 escape is right depends on where the result lands, not only on the helper's body. Single-quote escaping
 (`'` + `'\''` + `'`) is right outside quotes and wrong inside double quotes, where `'` is an ordinary
 character and `$(...)` still runs, so no helper's name or body proves the splice safe.
 `Studio/Described.swift`'s `quoted(_:)` escapes correctly where it is used, and is reported anyway.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made and never one invented:
 - A value interpolated whose type the rule cannot read is not judged: a subscript
   (`ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment[...]`, so the env-gated bench hooks in `AhraOsWindowModel.swift` are
   missed), a generic result, an Objective-C declaration outside `NSString`'s `stringBy` family, a closure's or
   a loop's untyped parameter, a pattern binding, an enum or a `URL`, and a name declared in another file of our
   own, which may be a `let` bound to a literal there (that last one is not judged as a `+` operand either).
   Such a value could also open a quoted heredoc the rule cannot see, so a value after it in the command is not
   judged either.
 - Arguments not given as an array literal or a `let` bound to one (a `let arguments: [String]` assigned in
   branches, which is the second bench hook), a spread of arrays, an executable set in another statement list
   than its arguments or held in a `var`, a program run through `/usr/bin/env`, and an argument vector for
   `posix_spawn` with the shell as its first element.
 - Interpreters that take a script by flag but are not POSIX shells (`fish`, `csh`, `python3 -c`,
   `osascript -e`): each has its own grammar for its script.
 - A value that itself holds a quoted heredoc's delimiter line, ending the body early: the TypeScript rule's
   accepted miss.
