/*
 No loop that awaits each item's own work one item at a time when nothing carries from one iteration to the
 next: `for entry in lanes { results.append(await entry.lane.snapshot()) }`. Every lane waits for the one
 before it to answer, so the loop takes the sum of their times where it could take the longest. The repair
 starts them together: `withTaskGroup`, collecting each result with its index when the order matters (a task
 group hands results back as they finish, not in the order they were started), or `async let` for a fixed few,
 or a bounded group when the collection can be large or the far side rate-limits.

 It ports `nexus/performance-no-independent-await-in-loop`, whose question is the same: report a loop over a
 collection only when its iterations can be shown not to depend on each other, so the finding is nearly always
 a real `Promise.all`. Its conditions map to Swift like this:
 - The loop walks a collection. A `for`-`in` that is not `for await` or `for try await`, over anything but a
   range or `stride`, or the indexed form `for index in items.indices` or `for index in start..<items.count`
   (the TypeScript `i < xs.length`). Any other range (`0..<60`, `1...3`, `0...items.count`, `0..<attempts`), a
   `stride`, `while` and `repeat` never fire: those are probes, retries and polling. A wildcard item (`for _
   in`) has no item to do work on, so it never fires either. A `for` binding is a `let`, so TypeScript's "the
   body writes its index" has no Swift shape.
 - The loop itself waits. An `await` in the body, not inside a closure, a nested declaration, or a nested
   loop's body or condition (that loop is judged on its own; a nested `for`'s sequence runs once per pass and
   is this loop's). An await on the item itself (`await task.value` over tasks started before the loop, or
   `await tasks[index].value`) serializes nothing and does not count.
 - No loop-carried state. Names are resolved by Swift's own scoping, read from the tree: a name declared in
   the loop (the item, a `let` or `var` in the body, an `if let`, a `catch`, a `case` pattern, a closure
   parameter) is the iteration's own, and since Swift has no function-scoped `var`, TypeScript's "a `var` in
   the body" has no Swift shape; one declared in the enclosing function before the loop, or a parameter of it,
   is a local of the function; anything else (a property reached through implicit `self`, a global, a capture,
   an `inout` parameter, `self` itself) is shared state. Then, as in TypeScript, a write to a local of the
   function (`total += n`, `cursor = next`, `&buffer`) is silence, and so is `pop`, `popFirst`, `popLast`,
   `removeFirst`, `removeLast`, `removeAll`, `next`, `read`, `sort`, `reverse`, `shuffle`, `swapAt` or
   `partition` on a local or shared receiver. Collecting results is allowed on a local of the function:
   `append`, `insert`, `updateValue`, `removeValue`, `merge`, `formUnion`, `add`, `set`, any `add`, `append`
   or `insert` followed by a capitalized noun, `local[key] = value` and `local.member = value`, provided the
   body, the loop's `where` clause and its sequence never read the filled path back (`results.count`,
   `queue` walked while it grows). Paths compare as member chains, as in TypeScript. Stricter than
   TypeScript, because an actor's or an object's properties are what the next pass (and every other caller)
   reads, and Swift's value types change in place: any write to shared state (`self.appearance = x`,
   `cache.append(x)`), any method called on `self` (`self.note(x)`), any bare lower-case call (`note(x)`, a
   method on implicit `self` or a global function, either of which may write shared state), and any method
   other than a collecting one on a local `var` (which may be `mutating`) is silence.
 - No exit on an awaited value. A `break` or labeled `continue` that leaves this loop, a `return`, or a `throw`
   that no exhaustive `catch` in the body handles, is silence when what decides it reads an awaited value: an
   enclosing `if`, `guard`, `switch`, `case`, `while`, `repeat` or nested `for`; a `catch` whose `do` awaits; a
   `do` that awaits before the exit and has a `catch`; an earlier statement that jumps on such a value; or the
   exit's own expression. "Awaited" is a fixpoint over the body's declarations, `if let`/`guard let` bindings,
   assignments, `case` patterns and catch bindings, as in TypeScript. Stricter than TypeScript: a `try` (not
   `try?` or `try!`) that no exhaustive `catch` in the body handles is an exit too, because Swift spells the
   failure path where TypeScript leaves it implicit in the await, and a loop that stops at the first failure
   never starts the rest, which a task group would already have started. A plain `continue`, and a
   `do`/`catch` that records the failure and moves on, are fine.
 - No ordered side effect, by name, anywhere in the body including closures: `print`, `debugPrint`, `dump`,
   `NSLog`, `os_log`, `fputs`, `fputc`, `puts`, `putchar`, `fflush`, `write`, `usleep`, `nanosleep`,
   `asyncAfter`, `yield` (`Task.yield()`, a continuation's `yield`), a bare `log(...)` or any function whose
   name ends in `Log` (`presenceLog`); names starting `sleep` (`Task.sleep`, `Thread.sleep`), `delay`, `wait`,
   `pause`, `throttle`, `backoff`, `rateLimit` or `print`; a name or receiver containing `progress` or
   `spinner`; and `log`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, `trace`, `critical` or `fault`
   on a receiver whose last segment contains `log` (`logger.info`, `poolLog.info`). Inside a `catch` in the
   body, and one level into every function of the called name declared in this file, the list narrows as
   TypeScript's does: a log receiver's `error`, `warning`, `warn`, `debug`, `trace`, `critical` and `fault`, a
   write to `standardError` or `stderr`, and `asyncAfter` report a failure or time a request, so they do not
   count, and a callee's own `catch` blocks are not read. TypeScript follows the callee through the checker,
   imports included; this rule reads the file it is given, so a callee elsewhere is not read (see below).

 Stricter than TypeScript, for actor isolation: every await the loop owns must be the item's own work. An
 `await` covers its whole expression, so the syntax cannot say which call in it suspends: every call, member
 chain and subscript in the operand (outside closures) must reach the item binding (`entry.lane.snapshot()`),
 `items[index]` in the indexed form, or a body `let` bound to such a chain, and at least one must; a bare name
 read as a value and a literal may stand beside them (`await entry.lane.snapshot(resolveSessionId: resolver) <
 0`). An await on `self`, on an implicit-`self` method, on a free function, on a type's static member or on any
 outer value is the same actor (or, for all the syntax can say, the same actor) on every pass, so the
 iterations would queue on it anyway, and the loop is left alone. That is what keeps AhraOS Presence's probes
 silent (`await self.save()` after setting `self.appearance`, `await settled()`, `await fromOld.nearest(to:)`,
 `withCheckedContinuation` around a callback), along with their `presenceLog` lines, `Task.sleep` pacing and
 outer counters.

 The finding spans the loop header, from `for` to the end of its sequence or `where` clause. Measured on
 2026-10-03: `ProviderProxy.swift:575` and `:620` in ahraos-macos, and nothing in ahraos-presence's 1,196 files.

 What it accepts as safe, and why: everything above that silences, because it is a reason the code shows for
 going one at a time; a nested `for await` in the body (the iteration consumes a stream, which is not a plain
 map); an `async let` (its work started already, so reading it later, by name or through a member, is not the
 item's work being started); and an await in the loop's own `where` clause.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made:
 - An await on a free function or an implicit-`self` method that is in fact nonisolated (`await
   fetchItem(item)`, TypeScript's commonest shape), a `withCheckedContinuation` around per-item callback work,
   and an await whose operand also calls something not rooted at the item (`await results.append(item.load())`,
   `await item.send(makePayload())`). The syntax cannot tell a nonisolated function from one isolated to the
   caller's actor.
 - A loop that also calls a pure global function (`min`, `zip`) or a non-mutating method on a local `var`,
   which the stricter state rules cannot tell from one that writes.
 - A `try` that leaves the loop on the first failure, even where starting every item is harmless.
 - An indexed walk bounded by anything but `.count` (`0..<items.endIndex`), or one whose awaited receiver is
   another collection subscripted by the index (`others[index]`).

 What it cannot see, and so could report where it should not (none did on either proving ground):
 - A callee that prints or sleeps, declared in another file or reached through an initializer; the callee scan
   reads this file's functions by name. Same-named functions in this file are all read, so that scan can
   silence more than it should, never less.
 - Shared state behind the item: two items that are the same object or actor, or an item's method isolated to
   one global actor (`@MainActor`), where starting them together gains nothing. TypeScript's rule has the same
   floor for a shared browser page or a filesystem race two calls down.
 - An ordered effect spelled some other way than the names above, as in TypeScript.
