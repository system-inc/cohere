 No force try: `try! work()`. A thrown error becomes a crash, and the error's own explanation is lost with
 it. The repair is `do`/`catch` that handles the failure, or `try` that passes it up, so the failure is said
 rather than detonated.

 Kirk's ruling on force unwraps covers this, since it is the same unchecked assertion: forbidden
 everywhere, report only. Matches SwiftLint's `force_try` and swift-format's `NeverUseForceTry`.
