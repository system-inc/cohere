 No `TODO` or `FIXME` comments: unfinished work belongs in the task tree, where it has an owner, a
 priority and a place in a plan, not in a comment that is read only when someone happens to open the file.

 The Swift form of our TypeScript `no-warning-comments`. Matched as whole words at the start of a
 comment's text, so prose that mentions "a todo list" is not a finding.
