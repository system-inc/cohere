import SwiftSyntax

/*
 No optional binding that binds nothing: `if let _ = value`, `guard var _ = value`, `while let _ = next()`,
 or a tuple pattern made only of `_`, such as `if let (_, _) = pair`.

 The binding throws its value away the moment it makes it, so the condition is a nil check wearing the
 clothes of an unwrap. A reader has to work that out; `value != nil` says it. The repair depends on what the
 right side is, and the message names the one that fits:

 - plain: `value != nil`.
 - `try? work()`: the question is whether `work()` succeeded. `(try? work()) != nil` asks it, with the
   parentheses, because `try? work() != nil` covers the comparison and yields a `Bool?`. If the failure
   deserves a reason, `do`/`catch` says it. This is the only report such a line gets: cohere's
   `correctness-no-discarded-try-optional` reports a `try?` only when it is a whole statement or the right side of
   `_ =`, never inside a condition, so the two rules cannot both report one `try?`.
 - `value as? Type`: the question is a type test, and `value is Type` is its name.

 Matches SwiftLint's `unused_optional_binding` with its default `ignore_optional_try: false`: `let` and
 `var`, in `if`, `guard` and `while` conditions, the wildcard pattern and tuple patterns made entirely of
 wildcards at any depth (the empty tuple `()` among them, since it binds nothing either), with or
 without a type annotation or tuple labels. The finding sits where SwiftLint puts it, on the pattern.
 A type annotation does not exempt the line: `if let _: Model = decode()` is still a nil check, spelled
 `(decode() as Model?) != nil` when the annotation is what picks the overload.

 Not reported, each because the line is not the shape this rule is about:
 - a tuple pattern that binds any name, such as `let (_, second) = pair`. Something is used.
 - `if case let _ = value` and `if case _? = value`. These are pattern matches, not optional binding, and
   SwiftLint does not report them either.
 - `let _ = work()` as a statement. That is a discard, not a condition, and other rules own it.
 - a backticked `` `_` ``, which the parser reads as a name rather than a wildcard. SwiftLint agrees.
