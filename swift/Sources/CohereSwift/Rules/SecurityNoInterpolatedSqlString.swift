/*
 No value written between the single quotes of a SQL string: `"SELECT count(*) FROM items WHERE kind = '\(kind)'"`.
 A quote in the value ends the string early, so the query breaks on ordinary input like `O'Brien`, and a crafted
 value runs as SQL. The repair is a bound parameter (`WHERE kind = ?` with `[.text(kind)]` beside the query), which
 moves the value out of the statement's text.

 It ports our TypeScript rule `nexus/security-no-interpolated-sql-string`, whose doc comment is the definition
 this follows, and shares its name. A TypeScript template literal is a Swift string literal with interpolations,
 a `${value}` is a `\(value)`, and the template's texts are the literal's segments as the program sees them
 (escapes resolved, a multi-line literal's lines joined), read by the same reader, character for character:

   - A statement: the text opens, after whitespace and `(`, with an uppercase `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,
     `DELETE`, `REPLACE`, `WITH`, `SHOW`, `EXPLAIN`, `PRAGMA`, `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `SET`, `VALUES` or `HAVING`,
     and, unless that is `WHERE` or `HAVING`, a second uppercase SQL keyword stands outside its strings and
     comments. The whole literal is read as SQL (single-quoted strings with `''` as one quote, double-quoted and
     backquoted names, `--` and `/* */` comments), and an interpolation is a finding when it sits inside a
     single-quoted string that closes in the same literal and opens where a value goes: after a comparison,
     `||`, `+`, `(`, `,`, or `LIKE`, `GLOB`, `REGEXP`, `RLIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `AND`, `SELECT`, `WHEN`, `THEN`,
     `ELSE`, `ESCAPE`, `DEFAULT` or `INTERVAL`.
   - A `LIKE` pattern in a fragment that is not a statement: an uppercase `LIKE` and a single quote, in a literal
     that also carries an uppercase `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `WHERE`, `SELECT`, `FROM` or `ESCAPE` and has an even
     number of quotes before the `LIKE`.

 The reader gives up on the whole literal, rather than guess, on a backslash inside quoted text, a `#` outside a
 string, `--` not followed by whitespace, a dollar quote, and a literal that ends inside a string, a name or a
 block comment. Keywords count in uppercase only: lowercase SQL is missed so that English is never read as SQL.

 The shape of the text decides, not the call it is handed to, as in TypeScript. In Presence the statement reaches
 SQLite through `SQLiteConnection` (`execute`, `rows`, `row`, `value`, each taking the statement as one string),
 and the store's `verify` passes it through a local closure first (`count("SELECT ... '\(kind)' ...")`), which a
 gate on the wrapper's calls would miss. The reader's gates are what keep a sentence that merely contains SQL words
 out. A literal whose type is a SQL library's own (one whose interpolation binds each value, the analog of a
 tagged template, which TypeScript skips) cannot be told from a `String` here and is read the same; a value
 quoted inside one is broken anyway, since it binds as the text `'?'`.

 Which values can hold a quote is the TypeScript rule's type gate, so this is a typed rule. The build's index names
 the declaration behind every name but a local, and the toolchain's demangler prints it with its type
 (`AhraOSPresence.SQLValue.text : Swift.String?`); a local's type is read from its own binding in this file. A
 value is a finding only when its type is shown to be `String`, `Substring`, `Character` or `Any`, or an optional
 of one, the members of TypeScript's `string`, `any` and `unknown`, read through `try`, `await`, `!`, `?.`, `??`,
 `+` and `as`:

   - A name bound in this file: a parameter annotated with one of those types (the annotation's name resolved to
     the standard library's); a `let` or `var` annotated with one, or initialized with a value shown to be one; an
     `if let`, `guard let` or `while let` of an optional one; a `for` loop variable over an array literal of string
     literals (`for location in ["Store", "Dataset"]`) or over a collection whose element is shown, through the
     standard library's `sorted`, `reversed`, `filter`, `shuffled`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `dropFirst`, `dropLast`,
     `lazy`, `enumerated`, `keys`, `values`, `Array(...)`, `Set(...)` and `+`, a tuple pattern taking a
     dictionary's key and value or a tuple's members in order.
   - A declaration the index names: a function's or initializer's result, from any module (`String(describing:)`,
     `store.create(...)`); a property declared outside this package (`url.path`); a property of ours that is
     optional or a collection; a non-optional property of ours only when it is declared in this file, read the way
     a local is.
   - A string literal that interpolates, or whose own text holds `'` or `\`.

 Safe, and silent:

   - An integer, a float, a boolean, and every type not listed above. A struct, class or array is not reported,
     as TypeScript does not report an object type.
   - A closed enum's `rawValue` (an enum's own, as its symbol says), and an enum case interpolated whole, which
     prints its case name: TypeScript's literal union.
   - A `let` initialized with a string literal that holds no quote, local or a property in this file
     (`let path = "Genshin/Motions/Clip.vrma"`, `static let table = "items"`): a compile-time name, TypeScript's
     `const` with a literal type. A `var` initialized the same way is a `String`, as a TypeScript `let` is.
   - A value inside double quotes or backquotes (an identifier), and one outside any quotes (a table name, a clause
     of `?` placeholders, `LIMIT \(count)`): the TypeScript rule reports neither.
   - The one escape TypeScript accepts, written where the reader can see it: the last two steps of a
     `replacingOccurrences(of:with:)` or `replacing(_:with:)` chain (Foundation's or the standard library's) double
     every backslash and every single quote, in either order, with string literal arguments (or a regex literal
     for `replacing`), on the value itself or in the initializer of the local `let` it names. With both doubled no
     input closes the string on any engine. Doubling quotes alone is reported, as in TypeScript: correct on
     SQLite, open on MySQL, and the text does not say which engine runs it.

 Known misses, each a place this rule cannot be sure and so says nothing:

   - A value whose type the file and the index do not show: an unannotated closure parameter, a generic parameter
     (TypeScript reports an unconstrained one), a binding from a `switch`, `catch` or `if case` pattern, a local
     closure's result, a value chosen by `?:`, `if` or `switch`, a subscript other than a dictionary's, an element
     of a collection whose type is not shown, and a member read from any of those.
   - A non-optional `String` property of ours declared in another file, which could be a compile-time constant
     (`static let table = "items"`) or an open value, and nothing the index carries says which. So is a struct's
     `rawValue` declared elsewhere, which TypeScript would report as a branded string.
   - An enum whose raw value itself holds a quote, which TypeScript would report as a literal holding one.
   - An interpolation with a label or more than one argument (`\(value, format: ...)`), which a custom
     interpolation decides.
   - Everything the TypeScript rule misses: SQL assembled with `+` from separate literals, a quote that opens in
     one literal and closes in another, a value inside a double-quoted string, lowercase SQL, and a statement
     opening with an interpolation. `ATTACH '\(path)'` is one too: `ATTACH` is not among the TypeScript rule's
     value keywords, so Presence's attach of its payload database (whose path doubles its quotes, correct for
     SQLite) is left alone.

 A typed rule reports all its shapes together, so a file no source of symbols describes is reported as unchecked,
 never as clean. No fix: the repair spans the statement and the parameters beside it.
