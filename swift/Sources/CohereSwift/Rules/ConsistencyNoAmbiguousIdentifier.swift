/*
 No single-letter names: `let n = items.count`, `for i in rows`, `{ e in report(e) }`. The Swift form of
 `nexus/consistency-no-ambiguous-identifier`, with its judgment and its messages carried over.

 A name is read everywhere it is used and declared only once, so the keystrokes a single letter saves are
 saved at the declaration and paid for at every read. The repair is the word the letter stands for:
 `count`, `rowIndex`, `error`.

 Which names: declared names only, exactly the set `cohere-swift/consistency-no-abbreviated-identifier` judges, found by
 its own visitor (`ConsistencyNoAbbreviatedIdentifier.Visitor`). A reference is spelled by whoever declared it, and our
 own single-letter declaration is reported once, where it is written. That visitor already skips an
 `override`'s name and its single-name labels (the superclass chose them), a label that is not also the
 parameter's name (API another type may dictate), and `if let value` with no initializer (it re-binds a name
 declared elsewhere, where the finding belongs).

 Only a single lowercase ASCII letter is in scope, which is the Go rule's line. An uppercase single letter is
 a type parameter by convention (`<T>`), and the Go rule leaves it alone, so this rule does too, even though
 the house spells type parameters as words (`<Element>`). A lowercase generic parameter, `<t>`, is judged
 like any other name. One place the shared visitor is wider than the Go rule: a protocol's property
 requirement is judged here, where the Go rule skips a TypeScript interface's property signature as a name
 somebody else may have chosen. A protocol is declared by this file, so its names are ours to rename.

 Exemptions, each the Go rule's:
 - `x`, `y` and `z`, the coordinate names, where the single letter is the conventional spelling and a longer
   one reads worse.
 - `a` and `b` in a sort comparator, because that is the shape everyone reads and naming them is noise. The
   Go rule exempts an `a` or `b` whose nearest enclosing function is the first argument of a `.sort(...)`
   call on some object. The Swift comparators are `sort(by:)`, `sorted(by:)`, `min(by:)` and `max(by:)`, so
   here the nearest enclosing closure must be the only argument of a call to one of those four names on some
   base (`items.sorted { a, b in ... }` or `items.sorted(by: { a, b in ... })`): a trailing closure with no
   other argument, or the single argument labeled `by`. A bare `sorted { ... }` with no base is not a
   comparator the Go rule would recognize, and a nested closure inside the comparator is judged on its own,
   both as the Go rule does.

 `_` is not judged, which is where Swift parts from the Go rule's `noUnderscore`. In Swift `_` is the discard
 pattern and the empty label, not a name anyone has to track.

 One exemption is ours, Kirk's ruling (2026-10-03): math notation in numeric kernels. A formula from a paper
 is checked against the paper, and there the letters are the names: Möller and Trumbore's `u`, `v` and `t`,
 the law of cosines' `a`, `b` and `c`, `lerp(a, b, t)`. Spelled out (`alongEdge1` beside an exempt `x`), the
 formula no longer reads as the one on the page. A numeric kernel is read from the signature, since this rule
 sees syntax and no types: the nearest enclosing `func`, or closure that writes every parameter's type, takes
 at least one parameter, every parameter is a number, the result is a number, an optional number or nothing,
 and a real number appears somewhere among them. A number is `Float`, `Double`, `CGFloat`, `Float16`, `Float80`,
 an `Int` of any size, a `SIMD2` to `SIMD64` of those, a simd type (`simd_float3`, `simd_quatd`,
 `simd_double3x3`, `matrix_float4x4`), an array or tuple of those, or any of them `inout`. A signature of
 integers alone is index and byte arithmetic, not a formula, so it is not a kernel. Everything declared inside
 the kernel counts, its parameters and locals and the parameters of a closure that leaves its types to
 inference; a nested `func`, a closure with its own written signature, a type, an initializer, a subscript or
 an accessor decides for itself. Inside a kernel only `kernelLetters` are allowed, a short set, each with the
 reason a paper uses it; `e` is never among them. Measured on the two AhraOS repositories before their renames
 (the cohere-zero branch), the kernel rule allows 274 of the 1,571 single letters this rule reported, all of them in the presence repository.

 `e` gets its own message, because it is the ambiguous one: it could be an error or an event, and which one
 decides the right name. The rule infers from context and says what it inferred, the Go rule's inference
 carried to Swift's shapes:
 - error: `catch let e`, or `catch let e as SomeError`, binds the thrown error itself. A payload bound in a
   catch pattern, `catch Failure.denied(let e)`, is not the error and falls through to the checks below.
 - event: an argument or trailing closure labeled `onSomething:` (the Go rule's `{ onClick: (e) => ... }` and
   `onClick={(e) => ...}`), a binding named like a handler whose initializer holds the `e`
   (`let handleClick = { e in ... }`), or a function named like a handler (`func handleKey(_ e: Key)`).
   "Named like a handler" is the Go rule's case-insensitive `handle|on[A-Z]|event`, which under case folding
   matches "on" followed by any letter.
 - otherwise "event", marked "context unclear", as the Go rule does.

 No fix, for the Go rule's reason: renaming a binding without following its references through scope leaves
 every other use pointing at a name that no longer exists. The suggested name travels in the message.
