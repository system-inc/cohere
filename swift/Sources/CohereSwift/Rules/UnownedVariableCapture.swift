import SwiftSyntax

/*
 No `unowned` references: `[unowned self]`, `[unowned(safe) delegate]`, `[unowned(unsafe) self]` in a capture
 list, and `unowned let owner: Owner` or `unowned(unsafe) var owner: Owner` on a stored property or a local.

 `unowned` is a force unwrap of a reference. It asserts the object outlives every use, and when that is
 wrong the process crashes (`unowned`, `unowned(safe)`) or reads freed memory (`unowned(unsafe)`), the same
 unchecked assertion the house forbids as `!`. The repair is `weak`, with a `guard let` that says what
 happens when the object is gone. Report only, no fix, because choosing that behavior is the point.

 Matches SwiftLint's `unowned_variable_capture` on capture lists, including `unowned(unsafe)`, which it also
 flags under its default `allow_explicit_unsafe_unowned: false`. Findings point at the `unowned` keyword,
 the column SwiftLint marks.

 Stored properties and locals are cohere-only by design. SwiftLint checks captures alone and lists
 `unowned var value: First` among its non-triggering examples, but a property is the same crash with a
 longer fuse: it holds the reference for the object's whole life instead of one closure's. The repair is
 the same `weak var` and a guard at each use.

 Nothing is exempt. The keyword is matched as the parser reads it (a closure capture specifier or a
 declaration modifier), so an identifier that happens to be spelled `unowned` is never confused with it.
