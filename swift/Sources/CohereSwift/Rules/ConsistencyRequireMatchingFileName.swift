/*
 A file is named for what it holds: `Type.swift` for the type it declares, and `Type+Purpose.swift` for
 extensions of a type it does not declare.

 Kirk's ruling. A reader looking for `ScrollbackBuffer` opens `ScrollbackBuffer.swift`, and a reader
 looking for what was added to `String` finds every `String+…` file together. The Swift form of our
 TypeScript `require-matching-file-name`. How many types a file holds is not judged (Kirk, 2026-10-03:
 TypeScript has no such rule, and file-length catches the file that is actually too big); what is
 judged is that the name leads to the main one.

 - A file declaring a type is named for it. Holding several, it is named for the main one, so any type
   may be the file's name as long as one is: the one its name matches, else the first is the main type,
   and the file is told to take that name. Extensions of the main type may sit beside it.
 - An extension of any other type belongs in that type's `+Purpose` file. A nested type can be named
   either way: `Outer.Inner+Purpose.swift` or `Outer+Purpose.swift`.
 - `main.swift` keeps its name, which SwiftPM gives meaning to (top-level code), so naming is not judged
   there. One-type-per-file still is.
 - Two extensions of another type stay beside the file's type, because moving them would cost what the
   ruling is for. Both were raised by @system_cohere_swift_ahraos_macos on real code:
   - A `private` or `fileprivate` extension. It is used only in this file, and moving it out would force
     it to `internal`, widening access to satisfy a naming rule. This holds in a `Type+Purpose.swift` file
     too (the Circle's second question, on `Terminal+AuthoritativeCheckpoint.swift`'s `VtColor` helper), as
     long as the file has a visible face of its own: a declared type or a non-private extension it is
     named for. A file of nothing but private extensions answers to the plain naming rule.
   - An extension whose every member names the file's type. `extension View { func delayWidthUntilIdle()
     }` beside `struct DelayWidthUntilIdle: ViewModifier` is the modifier's public face, and putting it in
     `View+Something.swift` separates the modifier from its only entry point, the opposite of findability.
 - A `Type+Purpose.swift` file may hold helper types beside the visible extension it is named for: private or
   fileprivate of any size, or a struct or enum of at most 30 lines (Kirk's ruling of 2026-10-03,
   #r3hfpe8). A larger internal type there is a type the file is not named for, so it is reported. Found by
   @system_cohere_swift_ahraos_presence un-nesting a probe file's helpers and Prune's `BinarySlice`: the
   ruling said they need not nest, and this rule then told the file to be renamed after the helper. A file
   whose only face is a helper still answers to the plain naming rule.
 - A file with no types and no extensions (free functions, a script) has no name to match.
 - `Name.generated.swift` is named `Name`. The marker says a generator wrote the file (Kirk's convention, shared
   with TypeScript), not what it holds, and a generated file answers to this rule like any other.
