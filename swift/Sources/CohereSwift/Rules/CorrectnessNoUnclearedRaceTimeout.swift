/*
 No timeout raced in a task group that nothing cancels: a `withTaskGroup` or `withThrowingTaskGroup` that adds a
 child doing the work and a child that only sleeps and then throws or returns, takes the first result with
 `group.next()`, and never calls `group.cancelAll()`. A task group always waits for every child before it returns,
 so when the work wins, the caller still sits out the whole timeout before it sees the result. When the timeout
 child returns a value instead of throwing and wins, the group waits for the work as well, so the timeout bounds
 nothing at all. Measured with swiftc 6.4 on 2026-10-03: work of 100 milliseconds raced against a 2 second sleep
 returned after 2.1 seconds without `cancelAll` and after 0.1 seconds with it; a 100 millisecond timeout that
 returns `nil` raced against 2 seconds of work returned after 2.07 seconds.

 It ports `nexus/correctness-no-uncleared-race-timeout`, which reports a `setTimeout` armed in a `Promise.race`
 executor whose handle nothing can reach, so it is never cleared when the other side wins. The race is the task
 group, the timer is the sleeping child, and the handle that clears it is the group's `cancelAll()`. Swift needs a
 different exactness in these places:
 - Returning is not clearing. A `Promise.race` that settles lets its caller go on while the timer lingers; a task
   group's body that returns, from any depth (`if let first = try await group.next() { return first }`), still
   waits for the sleeping child, which was measured above. So the Swift bug holds the caller, not only the
   process, and only `cancelAll()` clears it.
 - Throwing is clearing. A throwing group whose body throws cancels every child that is left (measured: a body
   that throws after the work wins returns in 0.1 seconds). So a body that cannot end normally once the result is
   read is not flagged: it has no `return` of its own after the read, and its last statement throws (or calls
   `fatalError` or `preconditionFailure`) on every branch of an `if`/`else`, `switch` or `do`/`catch`. TypeScript
   has no counterpart: a rejected race leaves its timer armed all the same.
 - The race is the shape that takes one first result: exactly one `next()` (or `nextResult()`) call on the group,
   not inside a loop of the body, with at least two children added before it in source order. TypeScript's race is
   `Promise.race` over an array literal. A loop over `next()` or `for await` over the group collects or drains,
   and a second `next()` reads past the first result; neither is read.
 - The timer is a child, added with `addTask` or `addTaskUnlessCancelled` (by trailing closure or `operation:`),
   whose body is exactly two statements: an awaited `Task.sleep` (any arguments, under `try`, `try?` or neither),
   then a `throw` or a `return` (with or without a value) holding no `await`. TypeScript reads any `setTimeout`
   in the executor whatever its callback does; a Swift child that sleeps and then works (a hedged second request)
   is not a timeout, and a child that only sleeps is also how a minimum duration is written, so neither is read.
 - The handle is lost when nothing but `addTask`, `addTaskUnlessCancelled` and `next` or `nextResult` touches the
   group in the body. Every other use is a way the group could be cancelled and stays silent without the rule
   following it, as every other use of a TypeScript handle does: `cancelAll()` anywhere (a `defer` at the top is
   the cleanest repair), `waitForAll()`, `isEmpty`, the group handed to a function, or named inside a nested
   closure or function. A nested closure or function that declares its own parameter of the group's name (a child
   running a task group of its own, also called `group`) is another binding, and is skipped.
 - TypeScript resolves `Promise.race` and `setTimeout` with the checker. This rule reads names: `withTaskGroup`,
   `withThrowingTaskGroup` (also through `_Concurrency.`) and `Task.sleep` are read as Swift's. A function of ours
   with one of those names would be read as the library's; neither proving ground declares one.

 The finding is the timeout child's `addTask` call, as the TypeScript finding is the `setTimeout` call. Two
 sleeping children racing each other are both reported, as two racing TypeScript timers are.

 What it accepts as safe, and why: a group that calls `cancelAll()` anywhere in its body; a group whose body throws
 on every path after the read; `for await` over the group and `next()` in a loop (they collect, they do not race);
 `withDiscardingTaskGroup`, which has no `next()`; a group with one child before the read; and every use of the
 group the rule does not follow.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made and never one invented:
 - `cancelAll()` on only some paths after the read (`if let first { group.cancelAll(); return first }; return
   nil`, where the `nil` path waits): any `cancelAll` silences the group, as any read of a TypeScript handle does.
 - A race read through `for try await result in group { return result }`, or through `while let`.
 - A timeout from a helper (`group.addTask { try await timeout(after: limit) }`, or `addTask(operation: timeout)`),
   which is not followed, as a TypeScript `timeoutAfter(ms)` is not.
 - A sleep on a clock (`try await ContinuousClock().sleep(for: limit)`, `clock.sleep(until:)`), a sleep written
   `_ = try? await Task.sleep(...)`, and a timeout child that does anything else besides.
 - Children added in a nested closure or function (`func add() { group.addTask { ... } }`), which names the group
   inside a nested function and so silences it.
 - A race on a group of our own type, on a group from a function of ours (`withCancellingTaskGroup`, which may
   cancel for itself), or on a group passed into a function as a parameter rather than created at the site.
 - A body that binds the group's name again anywhere (`let group = spare`, `if let group`), which is read as
   another group and silences the race.

 Beside this rule, not part of it: `cancelAll()` only asks. A child that ignores cancellation, such as
 `withCheckedContinuation` around a callback, still holds the group until it finishes, so a timeout raced against
 it bounds nothing even with `cancelAll()` (measured: 2.1 seconds for a 0.1 second timeout against a callback
 answering in 2). That is a different shape, and the rule does not read the work child.
