/*
 No property alias: a `let` inside a function that only renames a property onto a local of the same name.

     let tooltip = filterMode.tooltip
     IconButton(systemName: symbol, tooltip: tooltip)

 The reach `filterMode.tooltip` carries where the value came from and reads the same in any window; the local makes
 a reader scroll up to learn it. A naked local should mean this scope made the value. The repair writes the reach
 where the local is used and deletes the declaration. No fix: the rewrite is the author's to read.

 It ports `structure/consistency-no-property-alias` (Kirk's "reach over alias"), shape for shape:
 - A `let` binding one name to a member read whose last name is that name: `let value = state.inner.value`. The
   chain is names and member reads at any depth (`self.model.review.takes.count`), through parentheses. TypeScript's
   `const` and `let` both map to Swift's `let`; a Swift `var` is a copy made to be changed, and is never judged.
 - A different name is not an alias (`let value = options.other`), in both languages.
 - A call anywhere in the chain is caching, not aliasing, as in TypeScript (`format().timeZone`,
   `self.plainTerminalView.getTerminal().cols`). A subscript is a call in Swift (an index can be computed by any
   code), so `items[index].name` is never judged either, where TypeScript judges `record[key].value`.
 - An optional chain (`window?.screen`) is exempt in both, wherever its `?` sits. Swift adds the force unwrap
   (`a!.b`), which traps where TypeScript's `!` is only a type assertion, and casts (`(a as T).b`), which convert.
 - File scope is out of scope in both (`main.swift`'s top-level code is TypeScript's module scope), and so is a
   type's own member (`let shared = Store.shared` beside the methods).
 - TypeScript's one hatch, a local read in a React hook's dependency array, has no Swift idiom and nothing to map to.

 Where Swift needs a different exactness, and why. In Swift any property may be computed: `clock.now` is a new
 instant on every read, `EffectLibrary.shared.generation` takes a lock, `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment` builds
 a dictionary, and a class's stored property can change under any call. Neither the syntax nor the index can tell a
 stored property from a computed one (measured: sourcekitd records a getter call for a stored `let`, a stored `var`
 and a computed `var` alike), so the TypeScript rule's own exemption, "a chain that computes is caching", cannot be
 decided per property. What can be decided is when the property's nature cannot matter: the local is read exactly
 once, and nothing that could run code happens between the declaration and that read. Then the reach is evaluated
 once either way, at a moment nothing could have changed, and the rewrite changes nothing the program does. That is
 the whole of what is flagged. Each item below is a place where TypeScript reports and this rule is silent on purpose:
 - Read more than once. The local may be a snapshot: of a clock (macOS `ProviderProxyRequestTiming`: `let now =
   clock.now`, stored into three fields), of state another thread writes (Presence `OnsetStrip`: `let history =
   Ear.shared.history`, read field by field), of a counter compared and then stored (Presence `EffectRenderer`: `let
   generation = EffectLibrary.shared.generation`), or of a computed value worth computing once (`let angle =
   short.angle`, a quaternion's arc tangent). Each reach would read again, and could disagree or cost.
 - Read after a suspension point. Kirk's ruling: a `let x = object.x` taken before an `await` and used after it is
   the fix `concurrency-no-lost-update` asks for, a deliberate snapshot, so it stays silent. An `await` or a
   `for await` anywhere from the declaration to the end of the read's statement silences the line, so `library.removal
   = await perform()` (Presence `BodyProperties`), which writes through the local after the suspension, is silent too.
 - Read after code that could change it. Any call (a method, a function, an initializer, a subscript, a macro), any
   assignment or compound assignment, and any `&` argument between the declaration and the read, wherever it points:
   a class's property can change under a call to anything. A take-and-clear (Presence `ScreenRecorder`: `let conform =
   self.conform; self.conform = nil`) is this shape. When the read is the object written through (`layer.contents =
   make()`), the rest of its statement counts too, since the write lands after the right side runs.
 - Read inside a closure, a nested function, a `defer` or an `async let`, or named in a capture list. The closure
   runs on its own schedule, and capturing the value rather than the object is often the point: it keeps `self` out
   of a `Task.detached`, it crosses into a `@Sendable` closure, it reads SwiftUI state where the body observes it
   (Presence `DesignerBodies`: "Read here rather than in each tile, because a lazy grid builds its cells outside this
   body's observation").
 - Read inside a loop the declaration is outside of: the reach would run once per iteration. Hoisting a class's
   array before a hot loop is documented practice here (Presence EarDSP `Texture.frame`: "each read of a class's
   array property is an exclusivity check").
 - Never read. The compiler already warns, and there is no read to write the reach at.
 - A redeclaration of the chain's first name between the declaration and the read, after which the reach would name
   another object.
 - `if let`, `guard let` and `while let` are never judged: they narrow an optional, the Swift analogue of TypeScript's
   narrowing, and the reach cannot carry the unwrap. A shorthand `guard let conform` after a declaration counts as a
   read of it.
 - A type annotation (`let width: CGFloat = view.width`) may convert, so the line is not judged.

 Judged like any other chain: a value copy of a struct's property and a read through `self.` inside a type. With one
 read and nothing running between, there is no change for the copy to have been kept from, and `self.x` is the
 reach the message names.

 Taken as safe, as the TypeScript rule takes it: a property read, an operator and a string interpolation do not
 change the property being aliased, so they may sit between the declaration and the read.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made and never one invented:
 - Every alias read more than once, which is most of what TypeScript reports. Measured on 2026-10-03: of the 517
   alias-shaped `let`s inside functions in Presence's package, 420 are read more than once; of macOS's 16, 14. Many
   are true aliases (macOS `SessionDetail`: `let username = position.username`, read three times with nothing
   between), but nothing in the tree tells them from a snapshot.
 - A single read after harmless code (a `print`, a pure function, a value type's initializer), since a call is a
   call, and a single read inside a closure that is not escaping (`map`), which the tree cannot tell from one that is.
