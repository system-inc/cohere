import SwiftSyntax

/*
 No starting a task that can throw and then dropping it: `Task { try await save() }` as a statement. A task
 keeps the error its closure throws as its result, and only a reader of `value` or `result` ever sees it. A
 task nothing holds has no reader, so the error is gone without a trace, and the work fails silently. The
 repair is to catch the error inside the task with `do` and `catch`, or to keep the task and read its value
 with `try await`.

 The shapes are SwiftLint's `unhandled_throwing_task`: a call of `Task`, plain or specialised with `_` as its
 failure type (`Task<_, _>`, `Task<Void, _>`), whose closure holds a `try` (not `try?` or `try!`) or a `throw`
 that no catch-all `catch` (a bare `catch`, or `catch let error`) around it handles, including one in a
 catch-all's own body; and whose result is neither assigned (`let task =`, `self.task =`), nor read
 (`.value`, `.result`), nor returned (`return Task { }`, or the only statement of a function with a return
 type). A `Result { }` inside the closure handles what it holds. The finding starts where SwiftLint's does,
 at the `Task` the call names.

 SwiftLint judges whether the closure can throw by its spelling, and gets it wrong both ways. A `try` inside a
 nested closure or function counts for it, though that error never reaches the task, and a type of ours named
 `Task` is flagged: both false. A `catch` whose pattern is not a binding (`catch is CancellationError`, `catch
 Failure.timeout`) or that has a `where` clause counts as catching everything: both missed. This rule asks the
 compiler instead, reading which declaration the call resolved to from the index the build wrote. The
 concurrency `Task` (`s:ScT`) declares its initializer and its static `detached`, `immediate`,
 `immediateDetached` and `runDetached` twice, once where the failure type is `Never` and once where it is
 `any Error`, and the compiler picks the `any Error` one exactly when the closure can throw. That one answer
 covers all SwiftLint reads from the syntax (`try` inside an exhaustive `do`, `try?`, `try!`, `Result { }`,
 nested closures) and more it cannot: a typed `throws(Failure)` closure, `for try await`, a narrow `catch`, an
 operation passed by name (`Task(operation: work)`). A type of ours named `Task` resolves to its own module
 and is never flagged.

 Where we differ on purpose: `Task.detached`, `Task.immediate`, `Task.immediateDetached`, `Task.init` and the
 module-qualified `_Concurrency.Task` drop the error the same way and are found too; SwiftLint reads only
 `Task`. And this rule flags a task only where its value provably goes nowhere, as a statement. SwiftLint
 flags every task it does not see assigned, read or returned, so a task passed as an argument
 (`tasks.append(Task { })`), put in an array, or returned from a closure (`urls.map { url in Task { } }`) is
 flagged though something holds it; this rule does not. A statement drops its value except as the only
 statement of a body that returns it: a function with a return type other than `Void`, a getter, a closure,
 or a branch of an `if` or `switch` whose value is itself used. A statement of a result builder's body is
 collected, not dropped, and the builder calls the compiler records there say so; it is not flagged, where
 SwiftLint flags it. `_ = Task { }` is a written choice to drop the task, and is not flagged, as SwiftLint
 does not flag it. Nor is a task whose failure type is written as anything but `_` (`Task<Void, any Error>`),
 as SwiftLint does not: the writer chose the failure type by hand, and the declaration the compiler picked
 then says nothing about whether the closure throws.

 Misses, accepted: a task that is the only statement of a closure without a written `-> Void` is not flagged,
 though in a closure its caller types as returning nothing (`Button { Task { try await save() } }`,
 `.onAppear { }`) its value is dropped. The index does not say what the closure's caller does with its value,
 and `urls.map { url in Task { } }` reads the same and keeps every task. A task whose result is chained into
 anything but an assignment (`Task { }.cancel()`) is not read, and a typealias of `Task` is not followed. No
 sibling typed rule shares this shape.
