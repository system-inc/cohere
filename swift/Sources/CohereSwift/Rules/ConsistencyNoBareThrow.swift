/*
 No throwing an error made up at the throw site: `throw NSError(domain: "DanceImport", code: 1, userInfo:
 [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "no video track"])`. The domain is a string nothing else declares and the code a
 number nothing else names, so the failure has no identity a caller can catch: matching it means repeating
 both, `(error as NSError).domain == "DanceImport" && code == 1`, and nothing keeps that in step with the throw.
 The repair declares the failure as a case of an error type of our own (an enum conforming to `Error`, and to
 `LocalizedError` for its text) and throws that case, so a caller catches it by case and the compiler checks
 the match.

 It ports `base/no-bare-throw`, which refuses `throw new Error('x')` and the other built-in constructors that
 carry a message and no identifier. Swift cannot throw a bare string or a plain message, since only a type
 conforming to `Error` can be thrown, so the shape that survives is the one error built from a message and
 nothing else: `NSError` whose domain is a string literal written at the throw site. The pieces map one to one:
 - The anchor is the thrown expression of a `throw` statement, and the finding covers the `NSError(...)` call,
   as the original reports the `new` expression and leaves the `throw` keyword outside it.
 - The constructor is `NSError`, `Foundation.NSError`, or either one's `.init`. The original reads only a bare
   identifier, so `Errors.Validation` is not its business; `Foundation.NSError` is the same built-in spelled with
   its module, so it is read, and a type of ours named `NSError` inside another namespace is not.
 - The original's anchor is exactly a `new` expression, which leaves `throw cause ?? new Error('x')` unread. Swift
   reaches for that shape far more often, to throw a framework's optional error or a fallback
   (`throw reader.error ?? NSError(domain: "DanceImport", code: 2)`), and the fallback is the same ad-hoc error
   the rule exists for, built at the same throw site. So the right side of a `??` and both branches of a ternary
   are read too, through parentheses. That is the one place this rule reaches past the original's syntax, and
   it is the original's reasoning, not a wider idea.
 - The original exempts tests and the scaffolding they run on, by path, because a test's thrown message is the
   diagnosis and nothing branches on it. Here that is the target kind: a file of a test target is not read,
   decided inside the rule as `consistency-no-print` decides it, never by a path list. The original's other exemptions (the
   capture path, declaration-time and below-the-vocabulary directories) name places in one TypeScript
   repository that have no Swift counterpart.

 What it accepts as safe, and why:
 - A domain that is not a string literal: `NSError(domain: NSPOSIXErrorDomain, code: Int(result))`. A domain
   the SDK declares names a catalog of codes the caller can match (`POSIXError.Code`, `CocoaError.Code`), so the
   failure is declared, only by Apple.
 - A literal spelling of such a domain: a value starting `NS`, `kCF` or `com.apple.`, or ending `ErrorDomain`,
   the conventions every SDK domain constant follows (`"NSCocoaErrorDomain"`, `"AVFoundationErrorDomain"`,
   `"com.apple.LocalAuthentication"`).
 - Every typed error, whatever it carries: `CocoaError(.fileReadCorruptFile, userInfo: [...])`,
   `URLError(.badServerResponse)`, `POSIXError(...)`, `CancellationError()`, an error type of ours. Each has a
   code or a case a caller can match, as the original leaves a declared subclass alone.
 - An `NSError` built for an Objective-C API that requires one and not thrown: a completion handler's argument,
   an `NSErrorPointer`'s `pointee`, a delegate callback. Those are a third-party contract, which the original
   also leaves legal, and none of them is a `throw`.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made and never one invented:
 - An error built anywhere but the throw statement and thrown by name, `let error = NSError(...)` then
   `throw error`, or returned by a helper and thrown as `throw fail("...")` (Presence's `MToonLockerSky`), as the
   original reads neither a rethrow nor a call.
 - An ad-hoc error delivered by anything but `throw`: `continuation.resume(throwing:)`, `Result.failure(...)`,
   `promise(.failure(...))`. The original reads only throw statements and misses `reject(new Error())` the same
   way.
 - A domain held in a constant of ours (`NSError(domain: Self.errorDomain, ...)`): the rule cannot tell it from
   an SDK constant without resolving the name. And an ad-hoc literal that follows the SDK's spelling
   (`"com.ahra.ImportErrorDomain"`), which is exempt with the real ones.
 - An `NSError` subclass of ours, `NSError` wrapped in a cast (`throw NSError(...) as Error`), and one on the left
   of a `??`, where it is never optional and the compiler already warns.
 - A test-support file compiled into a library target rather than a test target, which is read and may report.
