/*
 No read, await, write: a write whose new value is computed from shared state as it was before an `await`.

     let count = self.count
     await save()
     self.count = count + 1

 While the function is suspended, other work runs on the same actor: another call into this actor, another task on
 the main actor, a callback. Swift's actor isolation stops two of them from touching `count` at the same instant,
 not from taking turns at every `await`, so a change made during the suspension is overwritten by a value computed
 before it. The repair reads after the suspension (`await save(); self.count += 1`), or keeps the whole read,
 compute and write on one side of it. No fix: which repair is right is the author's call.

 It ports `nexus/concurrency-no-lost-update`, condition for condition, each one required:
 - The function can suspend: it owns an `await` or a `for await` loop, never one inside a closure or a nested
   function, which runs on its own schedule. A closure is a function of its own here, as an arrow function is in
   TypeScript: `Task { ... }` is judged on its own awaits.
 - The write is a plain `=`. Compound assignments (`+=` and the rest) are never judged, and this is where Swift
   differs from JavaScript. Measured with swiftc 6.4 on 2026-10-03, an actor whose property another task bumps
   during the suspension: `total += await pause()` keeps the bump, because `+=` takes its left side `inout` and the
   access begins when the operator runs, after the right side has been evaluated and the await is over. So does
   `table["k", default: 0] += await pause()`, the same on a `@MainActor` class and on a global. TypeScript's
   `x += await y` reads `x` first and loses the update; Swift's does not. The same run showed what does lose it:
   `total = total + (await pause())`, `total = max(total, await pause())`, `items = items + [await pause()]`,
   `items = items.appending(await pause())` (a method's receiver is read before its arguments), `table["k"] =
   (table["k"] ?? 0) + (await pause())`, and a `let` read before the await and used after it.
 - The target is a member path: `self.count`, a bare `count` that no local binds (a property through implicit
   `self`, or a global, or a static member as `Type.count`), or a member of a parameter (`entry.retries`). `self.`
   and the bare spelling are the same path, since a bare name that is not a local resolves to a member of `self`
   before a global whenever `self` has one. Optional chaining and force unwraps (`self?.count`, `self!.count`) are
   transparent, and a subscript with one literal key (`self.table["main"]`) is a member, as TypeScript reads a
   quoted key. Names resolve by Swift's scope rules, read from the tree with the scope reading
   `concurrency-no-check-then-write` uses (`ConcurrencyNoCheckThenWrite.lookup`).
 - Someone else can write the target during the suspension. A member of `self`, a global and a static are shared:
   `self` is an actor, a class, or a struct whose property has a `nonmutating` setter, since nothing else compiles.
   The exception is a `mutating` or `consuming` method or an initializer (or a closure inside one): there `self` is
   held exclusively for the whole call, so nothing else can write its members while it is suspended, and a bare
   name there could be either a member or a global, so neither is judged. A member of a parameter that is not
   `inout` is shared for the same reason, since writing through it compiles only for a reference: the caller holds
   the object. An `inout` parameter is held exclusively, and an untyped closure parameter may be `inout`, so
   neither is judged.
 - The new value is computed from the target's prior value, read before a suspension that runs before the write on
   some path. The read is either in the written expression itself (`self.total = self.total + (await price())`),
   or reached through a `let` of this function whose initializer read it, through any chain of such `let`s.
   Expressions are evaluated in Swift's order along each path: left to right, a method's receiver before its
   arguments, `&&`, `||`, `??` and `?:` fork, and a suspension stales every read already taken on its path. Across
   statements, through the function's control flow: from the end of the `let` to the write, is there a path
   through an `await` (or a `for await` step) that does not declare the `let` again? Loops, `if`, `guard`,
   `switch`, `do`/`catch`, `defer`, labeled `break` and `continue`, `fallthrough`, `return`, `throw` and calls to
   `fatalError`, `preconditionFailure`, `exit` and `abort` are followed. A `try` reaches its `catch` before anything
   it covers ran, and also after, when what it covers is one call (which then threw from inside, past its own
   awaits); a `try` over several calls may have thrown from an early one, so only the first edge is drawn. An
   `await` whose expression holds the write runs after it, as in TypeScript.
 - The value is modified rather than copied, and computed here, which is the TypeScript rule's definition of a
   deliberate restore. Writing back exactly what was saved (`self.appearance = kept`) is a restore and never
   judged; any operation on the value (arithmetic, a call, a member read, a collection literal) makes it a
   modification. Two things are not: an awaited call's result, which is the callee's answer rather than this
   function's computation (`self.clip = await self.skeletons.clip(self.clip)`), and a write after this function
   itself wrote the target between the read and the write, which is the save-and-restore protocol (`let kept =
   self.appearance; for preset in presets { self.appearance = preset; await self.save() }; self.appearance =
   kept`). Stricter than TypeScript in the safe direction: a write to a path that contains the target counts as
   that write (`self.state = State()` replaces `self.state.count`), and so does a method called on the target or
   on a path containing it (`self.items.removeAll()`, which may be `mutating`) and passing it `inout`.

 The finding spans the whole assignment and its message names the target as written.

 What it accepts as safe, and why: a compound assignment (measured above), a value read after the suspension, a
 verbatim restore, a restore after this function's own replacement, an awaited call's result, a local of this or
 an enclosing function (see below), and any path it cannot resolve.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made and never one invented:
 - A local captured by a closure. TypeScript judges an outer variable written from a nested function; Swift 6
   rejects mutating a captured `var` in any closure that can run concurrently (`Task`, a task group's child), and
   a non-escaping closure (a task group's body, `forEach`) cannot run during the suspension, which leaves only a
   non-`Sendable` callback run on the same actor. The tree cannot tell an escaping closure from one that is not, so
   no local is judged, and neither is a member of a local (`let model = self.model; model.count = ...`).
 - An awaited operand that is not a call. `await` covers its whole expression and the syntax cannot say where in
   it the suspension falls, so reads inside it are taken as after it: `self.total = await self.total + pause()`
   loses the update (measured) and is not reported.
 - The TypeScript rule's store half (`getAccount` and `updateAccount` called with the same key across an await),
   which has no Swift idiom with that shape on the proving grounds; `UserDefaults` and dictionary subscripts with
   a variable key are not read.
 - A computed subscript key (`self.table[key] = ...`), as in TypeScript, since nothing here can show `key` held
   still.
 - A value copy of a path that contains the target (`let snapshot = self.state; await save(); self.state.count =
   snapshot.count + 1`), which is stale when `State` is a struct and live when it is a class: TypeScript reads it
   as an alias and stays silent, and so does this rule, since only types could tell the two apart.
 - `if let`, `guard let`, `var` and `async let` bindings as carriers of the old value, and tuple destructuring.
 - A read outside a closure written inside it (`let old = self.count; await save(); await MainActor.run {
   self.count = old + 1 }`), and a `let` of an enclosing function read in a `Task` that starts after it.
 - A function holding `#if`, or an expression the standard operators cannot fold (a custom operator), where the
   control flow or the writes are not all readable.
 - The value an `if` or `switch` expression chooses (`self.count = if flag { self.count + 1 } else { 0 }`); only
   whether one of its branches can suspend is read.
 - Top-level code in `main.swift`, and the implicit await at the end of an `async let`'s scope.

 The one assumption that could report wrongly: every `await` is taken to suspend, as TypeScript takes `await 5`.
 An `await` over nothing asynchronous never does, and the compiler warns about it ("no 'async' operations occur
 within 'await' expression"), so a finding there arrives beside that warning.
