import SwiftSyntax

/*
 No C-era spellings where Swift has its own: `CGPointMake(x, y)`, `CGRectGetWidth(rect)`, `NSWidth(rect)`,
 `arc4random_uniform(n)`. The old spellings predate Swift's own API; the modern form says the same thing and
 reads as Swift. One rule for four SwiftLint incumbents, each family under its own message id so findings
 compare per incumbent:
 - `legacyConstructor` (`legacy_constructor`): `CGPointMake(x, y)` becomes `CGPoint(x: x, y: y)`, and the same
   for CGSize, CGRect, CGVector, NSPoint, NSSize, NSRect, NSRange, UIEdgeInsets, NSEdgeInsets and UIOffset.
   Fixed: the callee becomes the type and each argument gets its label, the argument text left as written.
   Each of these C functions is a field-by-field initializer, so the rewrite cannot change meaning.
 - `legacyCGGeometryFunction` (`legacy_cggeometry_functions`): `CGRectGetWidth(rect)` becomes `rect.width`,
   `CGRectInset(rect, 10, 5)` becomes `rect.insetBy(dx: 10, dy: 5)`. Fixed: Swift imports these CoreGraphics
   functions under exactly those member names, so the member is the same function called the Swift way.
   The fix applies when the receiver carries its own type; otherwise the rewrite is a suggestion (below).
 - `legacyNSGeometryFunction` (`legacy_nsgeometry_functions`): `NSWidth(rect)` and its family. Fixed only for
   `NSEqualPoints` and `NSEqualSizes`, whose `==` compares the same two fields. Every other member is reported
   with the rewrite offered as a suggestion and never applied, because it is not the same function: the
   NSGeometry functions read the stored fields, while CGRect's members work on the standardized rectangle and
   treat empty and null rectangles their own way. Measured on macOS for a rect of width -4: `NSWidth` is -4 and
   `.width` is 4, `NSMinX` and `.minX` differ, `NSIntersectionRect` of disjoint rects is the zero rect where
   `.intersection` is the null rect, and `NSEqualRects` says false where `==` says true. SwiftLint applies all
   of these as fixes; this rule leaves that judgment to the reader.
 - `legacyRandom` (`legacy_random`): `arc4random()`, `arc4random_uniform(n)`, `drand48()`. Report only: the
   modern `Int.random(in:)` returns a different type than `UInt32`, so the repair is a decision about types.

 The rewrites move argument text as written and add parentheses only where moving it out of the call would
 change how it binds: `CGRectGetWidth(a ?? b)` offers `(a ?? b).width`, `!NSEqualPoints(a, b)` becomes
 `!(a == b)`, and a chain ending in a trailing closure is parenthesized so an `if` condition cannot misread it.

 A fix is applied without anyone looking, so it must never be able to break the build. An argument that
 leaves its parameter position (the receiver of a property or method, either side of `==`) also leaves the
 parameter's type behind, and anything whose type the compiler could have inferred from that parameter may
 no longer type-check: `CGRectGetWidth(decode())` with a generic `decode<T>() -> T` becomes `decode().width`,
 which does not compile. So the fix is applied only when every moved argument carries its own type: a plain
 name, `self` or `super`, a property chain on one (`view.frame`, `CGRect.zero`, `frames!.first`), or an
 explicit `as` cast (`value as CGRect`). Anything else (a function, initializer or subscript call anywhere in
 it, a generic member, an operator, a literal, a closure) keeps the finding and offers the rewrite as a
 suggestion instead, the way the NSGeometry rewrites are offered. Arguments that stay arguments (an
 initializer's, or a method's after the receiver) keep their parameter and are never a reason to withhold.
 No rewrite is offered at all when the edit would delete a comment, or when the moved receiver is typed only
 by the parameter (`CGRectGetWidth(.zero)` or `nil`), since `.zero.width` cannot compile however it is spelled.

 Matched by name, as SwiftLint matches: a call whose callee is the bare name. Not matched, each on purpose:
 - A call whose arity, labels or trailing closures do not fit the C function. The C function takes exactly
   that many unlabeled arguments, so any other shape is someone's own function. SwiftLint checks arity for
   the geometry functions only, and flags `arc4random(5)` or `CGPointMake(1, 2, 3)`.
 - Any name the same file declares: a function, a variable, a parameter or a closure parameter. A local
   `func CGPointMake(...)` or `func arc4random() -> Int` is the false positive matching by name invites, so
   once a file declares the name, no call to it in that file is reported, wherever the declaration sits.
   SwiftLint does not look. A shadow declared in another file of the module is invisible to one file's
   syntax and is the remaining risk; it would take a declaration whose name copies an Apple C function.
 - `NSEdgeInsetsEqual`, which SwiftLint rewrites to `==`. NSEdgeInsets is not Equatable, so that rewrite does
   not compile and there is no modern spelling to point to.
 - A qualified call (`Darwin.arc4random()`) and a bare reference (`.reduce(.null, CGRectUnion)`), which
   SwiftLint skips too: neither is a call of the bare name with arguments to move.
