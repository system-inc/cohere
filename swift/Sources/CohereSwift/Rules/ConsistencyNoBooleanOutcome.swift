/*
 No result shape that says how an operation turned out with a `Bool` beside an error or a value:
 `struct LookupResult { let success: Bool; let error: String? }`, or `typealias FetchResult = (ok: Bool, value: String)`.
 One bit collapses every way the operation can turn out, at the moment the distinction is cheapest to keep, and it
 leaves the reader to know which of the other fields hold for which value of the flag: is `value` the answer when
 `ok` is false, a placeholder, or nothing? "Not shaped like a code" and "shaped like one, but no such code exists"
 are different facts a caller usually wants to act on, and a lookup that finds nothing is an answer, not a fault. The
 repair is a sum type, which says by construction what each outcome carries: an enum with a case for each way the
 operation can turn out and the payload on the case that has it, or `Result`, or a throw for the failure.

 It ports `nexus/consistency-no-boolean-outcome`, which reads an `interface` and a `type` alias whose type is a bare
 object literal, and nothing else. The shapes map one to one:
 - An `interface` is a named field set with no behavior, and Swift's is a `struct`: its fields are its stored instance
   properties (a `let` or `var` with no accessor block, or with only `willSet`/`didSet`, which still stores). A
   computed property is derived, not a field a reader must know the validity of, and a `static` one is not the
   value's, so neither is read. `var ok, failed: Bool` gives both names the trailing type, as the compiler does.
 - A `type` alias of an object literal is a `typealias` of a tuple type with labels, each label a field. As in the
   original, only the bare literal counts: a parenthesized, optional or generic-wrapped tuple is not read.
 - A flag is one of the original's names exactly (`success`, `succeeded`, `ok`, `isSuccess`, `isOk`, `failed`,
   `isError`, `isFailure`) declared as `Bool` or `Swift.Bool`, the one type its `boolean` keyword names. A companion
   is a field named `error`, `errors`, `message`, `value`, `result`, `reason` or `data`, of any type. The first flag
   in declaration order is the one reported, on its binding (`ok: Bool`) or tuple element, as the original reports
   the property.
 - The original's exemptions are kept as they are, so the two languages decide the same field set the same way: a
   flag with no companion is ordinary state; a field set carrying any of TanStack Query's own fields (`isLoading`,
   `isPending`, `isFetching`, `isRefetching`, `status`) or every field of Cloudflare API v4's envelope (`success`,
   `errors`, `messages`, `result`) mirrors a third party's result; `isSuccess` beside `isError` is one settled state
   seen from two sides; a name ending `Properties` is display state. TanStack has no Swift counterpart, and the
   exemption is kept anyway, since a `status` beside `ok` mirrors an HTTP reply here as it does there.
 - The original exempts React properties, by their name, because a component's inputs are what to render, handed
   down by the parent. SwiftUI's components are the structs that conform to `View`, `ViewModifier` or one of the
   representable protocols, so a struct that declares one of those, on itself or in an extension in this file, is
   left alone the same way.
 - Generated code is held to the rule like hand-written code, as the original holds it, and so is a test target.
 - The original's `allowedTypeNames` option has no counterpart: this engine gives a rule no options.

 What it accepts as safe, and why: an enum with payloads, `Result`, and a throwing function, which are the repair; a
 literal or optional flag (`Bool?`), as the original skips `success: true` and a union with `undefined`, since neither
 is the bare two-valued flag; a flag named anything else (`isDone`, `matched`); a companion named anything else
 (`said`, `errorCode`, `daemonValue`); a field set with no companion, like Presence's `BodyRemoval.Outcome`, whose
 `isFailure` sits beside `said`.

 Known misses, every one a finding not made and never one invented:
 - An inline tuple, which is where Swift most often writes this shape: a property's type (macOS's
   `DeveloperSettingsView`, `[String: (ok: Bool, value: String)]`), a function's return type, a closure's. The
   original reads only declarations and leaves `Record<string, { ok: boolean; value: string }>` alone the same way,
   but TypeScript reaches for a named interface far more often than Swift reaches for a named tuple, so this port
   finds less of the idea than the original does.
 - A `class`, `actor`, `protocol` or enum case with labeled associated values: the original listens to no class,
   and a protocol's property requirements are a contract on conformers, not a result. A struct's stored properties
   inside `#if`, and a flag whose type is inferred (`var failed = false`), which an interface cannot spell.
 - Swift's spelling of an acronym, `isOK`, which the original's name list does not hold, and a type named `Bool` of
   our own, which a file rule cannot tell from the standard library's.
 - A struct made a `View` by an extension in another file, which is read and may report.
