/*
 No filtering a collection only to take its first element: `items.filter { $0.isActive }.first` is
 `items.first { $0.isActive }`. `first(where:)` says the question being asked and stops at the first match,
 where `filter` runs the predicate on every element and builds a whole new array (or dictionary, set or
 string) only to keep one element of it and throw the rest away.

 The shape is SwiftLint's `first_where`: `first` read from a member `filter` call, with a trailing closure
 (`items.filter { }.first`), an argument (`filter(predicate)`, `filter({ })`), or wrapped in one pair of
 parentheses (`(items.filter { }).first`), anywhere in a chain (`items.map { }.filter { }.first`), followed by
 anything (`.first?.name`, `.first!`), and on a line break (`filter { }\n.first`). The finding starts where
 SwiftLint's does, at the start of the `filter` call. SwiftLint also reads `first(where:)` called on a
 `filter`'s result as the shape, and so does this rule: `items.filter { a }.first { b }` still builds the
 array, and the repair is one `first(where:)` with both predicates.

 SwiftLint judges the spelling, so it skips by spelling too: a `filter` whose argument is a string literal or
 an `NSPredicate(...)` call, which is Realm's query `filter`, not a collection's. This rule asks the types
 instead, and flags only a `filter` the compiler resolved to one of the standard library declarations that
 build a new collection (`Array`'s, `Sequence`'s, `RangeReplaceableCollection`'s, `Substring`'s,
 `Dictionary`'s, `Set`'s), read from the index the build wrote, with a `first` that resolved to the standard
 library too. Realm's `filter`, and any `filter` of ours, resolves to its own module and is never flagged,
 whatever its argument, even when it is added to `Sequence` by an extension (`s:ST7ControlE6filter`, which no
 eager declaration's name starts with); a `first` an extension of ours adds is not the standard library's
 either; a standard library `filter` cannot take a string or a predicate object at all.

 A lazy `filter` (`items.lazy.filter { }.first`) is the standard library's and is not flagged: it builds
 nothing, and its `first` already stops at the first match, so the reason does not hold. Nor is an
 asynchronous sequence's `filter`, which is lazy in the same way. Both are left out by naming the eager
 declarations rather than excluding the lazy ones, so a declaration this rule has not seen is never flagged.

 On a dictionary or a set either spelling gives some matching element, not a particular one; when several
 match, the repair may give a different one, which neither spelling promised. Misses, accepted: a `filter`
 declared on a type of ours resolves to ours and is not flagged, even when it builds an array; a `filter`
 inside parentheses with `try` or `await` (`(try items.filter { }).first`) is not read, as SwiftLint does not
 read it. Where SwiftLint stops short and this rule does not: a bare `filter` inside a collection's own
 extension (`filter { }.first`) is found as well as a member one.

 Shared with the sibling rules: `items.filter { }.first != nil` is found here, and its repair,
 `first(where:) != nil`, is then `contains-over-first-not-nil`'s shape, whose repair is `contains(where:)`;
 going straight there is the better fix. `last-where` is this rule's twin for `last`, and reads the shape
 through this rule's `filterCalls(reading:filters:in:symbols:)`, so the two cannot drift apart.
