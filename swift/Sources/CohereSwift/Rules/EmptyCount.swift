/*
 No comparing a collection's `count` to zero: `items.count == 0` is `items.isEmpty`, and `items.count > 0` is
 `!items.isEmpty`. `isEmpty` says the question being asked, and it is constant time on every collection,
 where `count` walks a `String` or a lazy collection to the end to answer it.

 The shapes are SwiftLint's `empty_count`: `count` compared with the literal `0` by `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`,
 `>` or `>=`, on either side, written as a member (`items.count`) or bare (`count`, inside a collection's own
 extension). SwiftLint judges the spelling, so it also flags a `count` of ours that is not a collection's (a
 tally, a retry counter) where `isEmpty` does not exist. This rule flags only a `count` the compiler resolved
 to a standard library declaration (`Array.count`, `Collection.count`, `String.count`, `Set.count`), read from
 the index the build wrote. That is a difference in our favour on every non-collection `count`, and one miss
 accepted: a collection type of our own that declares its own `count` resolves to ours, not the standard
 library's, and is not flagged.

 The comparison is read from an operator-folded copy of the tree, so `total + items.count == 0` is judged as
 the sum compared with zero, which is not this shape, rather than as `items.count == 0`. Folding moves no
 token, so positions in the copy are positions in the file.
