/*
 No `fileprivate` on a top-level declaration: `fileprivate func helper()` at file scope. Write `private`.

 Least access. At file scope `private` and `fileprivate` mean the same thing, the whole file, so the
 wider-sounding keyword says nothing the narrower one does not and teaches the reader to reach for
 `fileprivate` by habit. Since Swift 4 `private` also reaches same-file extensions of the type, which removed
 the old reason to widen. The repair is the keyword swap, and the rule ships it as a fix: at file scope the
 swap cannot change meaning, and `fileprivate(set)` becomes `private(set)` with its `(set)` kept.

 Matches SwiftLint's `private_over_fileprivate` in its default configuration, finding for finding: the same
 declaration kinds (actor, class, enum, func, protocol, struct, typealias, var and let), at the top level of
 the file or of a top-level `#if`, reported at the `fileprivate` keyword. Not flagged, each on purpose:
 - A `fileprivate` member nested inside a type or extension. Whether it could be `private` depends on every
   use in the file (an extension of a different type, or a sibling type, may read it), which needs more than
   one declaration's syntax to prove. SwiftLint draws the same line.
 - `fileprivate extension`. SwiftLint checks extensions only with `validate_extensions`, off by default, so
   the house default leaves the spelling of an extension's access to its author.
 Where we differ from SwiftLint is the fix only. SwiftLint replaces the whole modifier, so its fix turns a
 top-level `fileprivate(set) var` into `private var`, which also narrows the getter and breaks readers in
 other files. This rule replaces the keyword token alone.
