/*
 No folding into a copy-on-write value with `reduce(_:_:)`: `values.reduce([]) { $0 + [$1] }` is
 `values.reduce(into: []) { $0.append($1) }`. `reduce(_:_:)` hands the closure its accumulator as a constant and
 takes back a new one, so a closure that grows an array, dictionary, set or string copies the whole of it on every
 element, quadratic in the length. `reduce(into:_:)` hands the closure the accumulator as `inout`, and one value
 grows in place.

 The shape is SwiftLint's `reduce_into`: a call of `reduce`, as a member (`values.reduce`) or bare (`reduce`,
 inside a sequence's own extension), with two arguments or one and a trailing closure, whose first argument is
 unlabelled (so not `reduce(into:)`) and is one of: a string literal; an array or dictionary literal; a call of
 `Array`, `Dictionary` or `Set`, plain or specialised (`Array<Int>()`, `Set<Int>(minimumCapacity: 4)`), or of
 their `init` (`Dictionary<String, Int>.init()`); or a call of the array or dictionary sugar
 (`[Int](repeating: 0, count: 10)`, `[String: Int]()`). The finding starts where SwiftLint's does, at the
 `reduce` name.

 SwiftLint judges the spelling, so it also flags a `reduce` of ours, and a literal that became a type which is
 not copied at all. This rule flags only a `reduce` the compiler resolved to the standard library's
 `Sequence.reduce(_:_:)`, read from the index the build wrote, and then asks the index what the initial value
 is. An array or dictionary literal is flagged only where the compiler recorded the literal as building an
 `Array`, `ContiguousArray`, `Set` or `Dictionary`: an `OptionSet`'s `[]`, the common `flags.reduce([]) {
 $0.union($1) }`, is a bit field that nothing copies, and records no initializer at all, and a literal type of
 ours records its own. An interpolated string literal is flagged when it records `String`'s interpolation. A plain string
 literal that became a `String` records nothing, the same nothing a `Character` or a `StaticString` records,
 so it is read by what it holds: one character could be a `Character` (or a `Unicode.Scalar`) and is not
 flagged, anything else (`""`, `"abc"`) is a `String` or a `StaticString`, and a `StaticString` cannot be
 combined into anything, so it is flagged as a `String`. A literal that records another type's initializer (a
 `Substring`, a type of ours) is not flagged. A named type is confirmed by what its name resolved to,
 so a `Set` of our own declaring is not the standard library's. The sugar `[Int]` and `[String: Int]` can only
 be an array and a dictionary, so its calls are taken by their syntax.

 Where we differ on purpose, in the direction of finding more of the same thing: `String(...)` and
 `ContiguousArray(...)` are copy-on-write too and are found as initial values, and `[Int].init()` is found as
 `[Int]()` is. A lazy sequence's `reduce` is the same `Sequence.reduce(_:_:)` and copies its accumulator the same
 way, so it is flagged. No sibling typed rule shares this shape.

 Misses, accepted: a `reduce` declared on a type of ours resolves to ours and is not flagged; a one-character
 string literal (`reduce(",")`) cannot be told from a `Character` and is not flagged; an initial value that is a
 variable, a property, a function's result, `.init()` with its type inferred, `Swift.Array<Int>()`, or a
 typealias of an array resolves to nothing this rule can read as a copy-on-write type, and is not flagged.
