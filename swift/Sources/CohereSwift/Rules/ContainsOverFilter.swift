/*
 No filtering a collection only to ask whether anything passed: `items.filter { $0.isActive }.isEmpty` is
 `!items.contains { $0.isActive }`, and `items.filter { $0.isActive }.count > 0` is `items.contains { $0.isActive }`.
 `contains(where:)` says the question being asked and stops at the first match, where `filter` runs the
 predicate on every element and builds a whole new array (or dictionary, set or string) only to count it and
 throw it away.

 The shapes are SwiftLint's `contains_over_filter_count` and `contains_over_filter_is_empty`. The first is a
 `filter` call's `count` compared with a zero literal by `==`, `!=` or `>`; the second is `isEmpty` read from
 a `filter` call. Both take the call with a trailing closure (`filter { }`), an argument (`filter(predicate)`,
 `filter({ })`), or wrapped in one pair of parentheses (`(items.filter { }).isEmpty`). A zero is read as
 SwiftLint reads it, so `0`, `00`, `0x0` and `0_0` are zero and `01` is not. The two keep their own message
 ids, `filterCount` and `filterIsEmpty`, so each finding maps to its SwiftLint rule.

 SwiftLint judges the spelling, so it also flags a `filter` of ours, on a type that is no collection and may
 have no `contains(where:)` at all. This rule flags only a `filter` the compiler resolved to a standard
 library declaration (`Sequence.filter`, `Array.filter`, `Dictionary.filter`, `Set.filter`, `String.filter`),
 and for the count shape only a `count` that resolved there too, read from the index the build wrote. A lazy
 `filter` (`items.lazy.filter { }`) is not flagged although it is the standard library's: it builds nothing,
 and its `isEmpty` already stops at the first match, so the reason does not hold. The rule tells it by
 `Lazy` in the symbol name, which every lazy `filter` declaration carries.

 Where we differ on purpose, in the direction of finding more of the same thing: the comparison is read from
 an operator-folded copy of the tree, so `items.filter { }.count > 0 && ready` is found, where SwiftLint reads
 only a comparison that is the whole expression. Zero may stand on either side (`0 < items.filter { }.count`,
 `0 == ...`, `0 != ...`), as it may in `empty_count`. A bare `filter` inside a collection's own extension
 (`filter { }.isEmpty`) is found as well as a member one. Folding moves no token, so positions in the copy are
 positions in the file, and a finding starts where SwiftLint's does: at the comparison, or at the `isEmpty`
 read.

 Misses, accepted: a `filter` declared on a type of ours resolves to ours and is not flagged, even when it
 builds an array; `count >= 1`, `count < 1` and `count <= 0` ask the same question and are not SwiftLint's
 shapes, so they are left alone; a lazy `filter`'s `count` compared with zero walks the whole sequence where
 `contains(where:)` would stop, and is skipped with the rest of the lazy case. A `filter { }.count == 0` on an
 array is also `empty_count`'s shape, and that rule reports it too: its repair is `isEmpty` on the filtered
 array, this one's is no array at all.
