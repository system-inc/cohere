/*
 No conditional whose every branch does the same thing: `highQuality ? "pro" : "pro"`, or `if ready { start() }
 else { start() }`. The condition chooses nothing, so the code runs the same way whether it is true or false. It is
 nearly always a copied branch that was never edited, and the reader trusts a decision that is not being made. The
 repair is to write the branch that was meant, or, if both really are the same, to drop the conditional and keep one
 copy. There is no fix, because which branch was meant is the author's call.

 It ports `nexus/correctness-no-identical-branches`, whose first site was ahra's Kling request builder, where a
 quality flag picked `'pro'` either way. The shapes map one to one:
 - A ternary is a ternary. The engine's tree is not operator-folded, so the rule folds its own copy with the standard
   operator table, as identical-operands does; folding moves no token, so positions are the file's. Parentheses
   around a whole branch are dropped, so `ready ? (count + 1) : count + 1` matches.
 - An `if` with an `else`, whether a statement or an `if` expression. An `if` with no `else` has no second branch.
 - An `else if` chain is judged from its last `if`, the one with the final `else`: when its two branches match, that
   condition is ignored, and the finding widens up the chain over every earlier `if` whose branch is the same too.
   `if a { x() } else if b { x() } else { x() }` is one finding on the whole chain, and `if a { y() } else if b { x() }
   else { x() }` is one finding on `if b`. A ternary chain widens the same way through its false branch. Two equal
   branches with a different one after them, `if a { x() } else if b { x() } else { y() }`, are not reported: that is
   `if a || b` written long, and both conditions still decide. A chain with no final `else` is never reported.
 - Empty branches (`{}`, or braces holding only comments) are not reported: a commented empty branch carries its
   intent in the comments, the one thing the comparison ignores. Branches that only `return`, `break`, `continue` or
   `throw` are reported.
 - `switch` is not covered, as the original declines it: a token-equal pair of cases can still differ in what falls
   through to them, and the default is usually the case written differently.
 - The original's `else if` against an `if` held in the first branch, `if a { if c { p() } else { q() } } else if c
   { p() } else { q() }`, is kept: the one statement of the first branch is compared with the whole `else if`.

 Same means the same tree written with the same tokens, as the original compares it, and as identical-operands and
 duplicate-conditions compare token kinds: node kinds, each child in the same slot, and every token's kind and text,
 with whitespace and comments ignored. The tree matters as well as the tokens because Swift reads a line break:
 `load\n(next)` is a reference and a tuple, two statements, where `load(next)` is one call, and the two have the
 same tokens. `"pro"` and `#"pro"#` are different tokens and stay different. A multi-line string's segments carry
 their indentation past the closing delimiter in the token, so two literals that differ only there differ.

 Where Swift needs a different exactness than TypeScript, each toward finding less:
 - The original asks the type checker whether a narrowing condition makes the same tokens resolve differently in
   each branch (`typeof value === 'string' ? format(value) : format(value)`). Swift narrows nothing through a Boolean
   condition: `x is String` and `x != nil` change no type, and a ternary's condition can only be a Boolean. So a
   ternary, and an `if` whose conditions are all Boolean expressions, mean the same thing in both branches, and the
   comparison needs no types. What Swift has instead are conditions that bind a name, `if let`, `if var` and `if
   case`, whose first branch sees a new declaration that may shadow one the second branch sees under the same
   spelling (`if let name { show(name) } else { show(name) }` passes a `String` and then a `String?`). An `if`
   whose binding or pattern conditions spell any identifier its first branch also spells is left alone; one whose
   branches use none of those names is still judged, since the binding cannot reach them.
 - `if #available` and `if #unavailable` are left alone: the same call can resolve to a newer overload in the first
   branch and an older one in the second, which is the reason to write such a pair.
 - A statement `if` that a result builder may transform is left alone. Under a builder each branch becomes its own
   `buildEither` arm, so SwiftUI gives `if flag { Editor() } else { Editor() }` two identities, and flipping the flag
   rebuilds the view and resets its state: the same tokens are different code. A file cannot see which builder
   applies, so the rule asks where the `if` sits. A closure, or a function, getter or subscript with a result type
   other than `Void`, may be transformed unless its own body holds a `return`, which turns the transform off (SE-0289,
   for a closure, an attributed declaration and one inferred from a protocol like `View.body`). An `if` there is
   skipped. An `if` in expression position (`let mode = if a { ... } else { ... }`), in an initializer, a setter, an
   observer, a `Void` function, top-level code, or a body with a `return`, is judged. A ternary is one value of one
   type under any builder, and is judged everywhere.
 - Branches that expand a freestanding macro are left alone. `#line` and `#column` are the position they are written
   at, so `if verbose { log(#line) } else { log(#line) }` tells the two apart, and any macro may read its position.
   A default argument that captures the caller's position (`fatalError`'s `line: UInt = #line`) is not treated this
   way: two copies of a crash in two branches still choose nothing, as two copies of a `throw` do in TypeScript.
 - A `#if` is a compile-time choice, not a conditional the code makes, and is not read.

 Known misses, each a finding not made and never one invented:
 - An `if` in a closure with no `return`, which is most callbacks (`Button` actions, `Task { }`, completion
   handlers), and in a value-returning function or getter with no `return`, which includes a body that is one `if`
   expression. Without the compiler's word on which closure parameters carry a builder, these cannot be told from
   `View.body`.
 - An `if let` or `if case` whose first branch spells any identifier its pattern spells, even one the pattern does
   not bind: `if case .loaded(expected) = state { show(expected) } else { show(expected) }` compares with an existing
   `expected` rather than binding one, and `if case .loaded = state { log(.loaded) } else { log(.loaded) }` only names
   the case. Both are left alone. A name spelled only in the value matched (`cache[key]`) does not count.
 - A statement `if` in a function or getter whose `Void` result is spelled `Swift.Void`, which is read as a result.
 - Branches that differ only in a trailing semicolon or in backticks on a name, which are different tokens; and
   branches that expand any freestanding macro, `#expect` and `#selector` included.
 - A ternary whose operator sequence holds an infix operator the standard table does not know, whose grouping the
   fold can only guess, as identical-operands skips the same.
