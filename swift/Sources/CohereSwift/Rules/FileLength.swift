/*
 A file holds at most 2,000 lines.

 Kirk's ruling (2026-10-03, #r3hfpe8). The size of a file is what a reader pays for, not how many types it
 holds: a file with one type and a fifteen-line helper beside it is easy to hold, and a 2,426-line file with
 one type is not. So size is checked on its own. A file past the limit has seams in it, and the repair is to
 split along them: an extension per concern (`Type+Purpose.swift`), or a type of its own (the orbit camera
 out of a 2,241-line viewport, for one).

 The threshold is Kirk's: 2,000. The line counts of every owned file in the two Swift repos on 2026-10-03
 (#r3hfpe8) put it in context. Of 1,469 files the median was about 100 lines; 141 were over 400 (SwiftLint's
 default), 20 over 1,000, 6 over 1,500 and 3 over 2,000. The limit reports only the files no reader can hold,
 rather than every substantial view or service, which a lower limit would turn into splits made to satisfy
 a number.

 Lines are counted the way SwiftLint's `file_length` counts them in its default configuration: every line,
 comments and blank lines included, with a final newline ending the last line rather than starting another.
 A comment is part of what a reader has to hold, and a count that skipped comments would reward moving
 explanation out of the file, the opposite of what the house wants. SwiftLint reports at the last line; this
 rule reports once at line 1, column 1, zero width, because the file as a whole is what is too long.
