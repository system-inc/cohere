/*
 No force unwrap: `value!`. The Swift form of our TypeScript `no-non-null-assertion`.

 Kirk's ruling: forbidden everywhere, report only, no automatic fix. A force unwrap is a crash the author
 decided could not happen, written so the reader cannot see the reasoning. The repair is a `guard let` or
 `if let` that says what happens on nil, and choosing that behavior is the point, so no fixer chooses it.

 Matches SwiftLint's `force_unwrapping` and swift-format's `NeverForceUnwrap` (off in our `.swift-format`
 because this rule replaces it). Implicitly unwrapped optional types (`T!`) are their own rule.
