/*
 What the engine's build scratch keeps that nothing reads any more, removed after a build succeeds. One project
 has one scratch (`<root>/.cache/cohere/swift`), so the scratch itself never multiplies; what grows is inside it.
 The rule is Kirk's, the one the release cache keeps (#ve5gps3, bc85c90): keep what is current and anything used
 within the last hour, re-check right before removing, and remove one named file at a time, a directory only once
 its files are gone.

 - The index store's records. A compile writes its file's record under a name made from the record's content and
   points the file's unit at it, so every edit that changes what a file declares or references leaves the old
   record behind, named by no unit. The store reaches a record only through a unit, so a record no unit names is
   one nothing can read. Measured on the proving-ground worktrees after a day of edits: 226 of 2,969 records
   (6.9 MB of 38 MB) on ahraos-macos and 300 of 6,747 (12.9 MB of 93 MB) on Presence; fresh copies have none. A
   record written within the hour stays, and if any unit is written after the plan was made, a build is running
   against the store and nothing is removed.
 - A local package's scratch (`local/<package>`), built for that package's tests. It is kept while the package
   model lists the package as local, and a build refreshes its time; one whose package is no longer local goes
   once it has not been used for an hour.

 Not pruned: the build descriptions under `out/Intermediates.noindex/XCBuildData`. The build system keeps them
 in an on-disk cache with a size limit of its own (`BuildDescriptionOnDiskCacheSize` in swift-build, evicted
 through `prior-build-descriptions.txt`), and both proving grounds hold exactly four however many builds they
 ran. Removing one it still lists would cost a rebuilt description and gain nothing the limit does not.
