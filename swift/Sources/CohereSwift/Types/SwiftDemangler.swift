/*
 The toolchain's own demangler, `libswiftDemangle.dylib` beside `libIndexStore.dylib`: it turns a Swift
 declaration's mangled name into the declaration it spells, signature and all. `$sSTsE7forEachyyy7ElementQzKXEKF`
 is `(extension in Swift):Swift.Sequence.forEach((A.Element) throws -> ()) throws -> ()`.

 The index names the declaration a name resolves to by its unified symbol name, which for a Swift declaration
 is its mangled name with `s:` in place of `$s`. A typed rule that needs more than which declaration (the type
 of a parameter, say) reads it here, in the compiler's own words, rather than in a reading of the mangling of
 ours. Loaded at run time, as the index store library is, so the binary never carries one Xcode's path.

 `@safe` though it holds a C function: the function is private, and its one call is in `demangle`, which hands it
 a buffer `demangle` sized and owns.
