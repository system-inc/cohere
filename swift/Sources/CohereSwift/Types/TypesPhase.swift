/*
 The compiler's own errors and warnings for every file we own, read from what the build recorded rather
 than from what it printed.

 The build runs into the engine's cache (`--scratch-path`), never the project's `.build`. It builds test
 targets too, because their files are ours and a test that does not compile is a finding like any other.
 Then every serialized diagnostics file in each owned target's build directories is read, each diagnostic
 is placed by its own file path, and duplicates are dropped: an executable target is compiled twice (once
 normally, once testable for its tests), and both copies report the same warning.

 A file is covered only when its own `.dia` exists and is newer than the source. A missing or older
 record means the compiler did not vouch for the file as it stands, usually because the build stopped
 before reaching it. That file is listed by name and the run is incomplete, never quietly clean.

 Measured on Swift 6.4's build system: records live at
 `out/Intermediates.noindex/<Package>.build/Debug/<Target>-{p,t}[...].build/Objects-normal/<arch>/<File>.dia`.
 A layout the phase cannot find any record in is a loud failure, because the build system moved its
 output once already (the index store went to `out/v5` in 6.4) and may move this too.
