/*
 The Swift compiler as a library in this process: `sourcekitdInProc`, the parser, Clang importer and type
 checker Xcode and SourceKit-LSP run, loaded with dlopen from the toolchain `xcrun` names.

 This is the door the design calls (b). It answers per file, in the context of the file's module, with the
 compiler's own diagnostics and the type of every expression, so a rule can ask what a value is instead of
 guessing from its spelling. Measured on ahraos-macos: the first file of a process 0.19 to 1.1s, later
 files 0.09 to 0.25s each; an injected `let x: Int = "nope"` comes back as the compiler's own error at its
 line and column, and a `var` never mutated as its warning with the fix-it.

 One process holds one session, `shared`, initialized once and never shut down: the compiler inside
 registers its classes at `sourcekitd_initialize`, and a second initialization in the same process aborts
 it ("Double registration of class MultipleValueInstructionResult", measured when a second test made a
 second session). The session builds one AST at a time, and requests sent from several threads at once
 cancel each other (21 of 22 in the design's probe, even with `key.cancel_on_subsequent_request: 0`), so
 each question holds a lock from opening its document to closing it.

 A file is opened as an editor document before it is asked about, because a cold `source.request.diagnostics`
 on a file nobody opened returned an empty answer in the design's first probe. It is closed afterwards, so
 the session does not hold every AST of a 472-file module at once.

 `@safe` though it holds sourcekitd's C functions: they are private and called only in `send`, `uid` and the
 `set`s, and a question sees its request only as a `Request`, never as the pointer inside it.
