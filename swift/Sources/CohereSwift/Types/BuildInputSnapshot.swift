/*
 A fingerprint of everything a `swift build` reads, so the types phase can tell that nothing changed since the
 last build that succeeded and read that build's compiler records instead of building again. The no-op build
 costs 5.1s on ahraos-macos and 7.0s on ahraos-presence warm, most of a warm run; the walk below costs 7ms
 and 39ms.

 What goes in, and why each is enough:

 - every file under each package root and each path dependency, by path, size and modification time, hidden
   directories and `.build` left out. That is the signal SwiftPM's own incremental build trusts, so this is
   exactly as safe as the build it replaces, and it catches what a source-only walk would miss: a header
   outside a target, a resource, `Packages/` from `swift package edit`;
 - the root's `Package.resolved` by content, which pins every remote dependency's checkout;
 - the toolchain and the build's own arguments, so a toolchain change or `--no-fix`'s disabled resolution is
   a different build.

 The fingerprint is taken before a build starts and stored only after every build succeeded, so an edit made
 while a build ran, or a build that failed or was killed, always means building next time. A cache that
 never invalidates reports the last answer forever, which on a measurement looks exactly like a clean tree,
 so the test that matters is warm-after-a-change (`BuildInputSnapshotTests`, and the pipeline control that
 plants a type error after a warm run).
