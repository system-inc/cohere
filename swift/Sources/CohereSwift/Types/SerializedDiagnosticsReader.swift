/*
 Reads the compiler's serialized diagnostics (`.dia` files) through the toolchain's own libclang.

 This is how the types phase knows what the compiler said about a file even when this run's build did not
 recompile it. An incremental `swift build` prints only the diagnostics of files it recompiled; measured on
 Swift 6.4, a cold build printed a warning and a no-op rebuild printed nothing while the warning was still
 in the code. Every compiled file's `.dia` survives until that file compiles again, so reading them
 answers for every file, not only the ones that happened to rebuild.

 libclang is loaded with dlopen from the toolchain `xcrun` names, not linked by path. See the shim header
 for why.

 `@safe` though it holds libclang's C functions: they are private, called only in `read` and `text`, and every
 pointer libclang lends there is copied into a Swift value before the set or string that lent it is disposed.
