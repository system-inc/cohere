/*
 The gate before the types phase may take its diagnostics from sourcekitd instead of the build: for every
 file the engine owns, what sourcekitd says against what the build's `.dia` records say, finding for
 finding.

 The build is the oracle because it is the compiler's own verdict on the package as `swift build` compiles
 it. sourcekitd is the same compiler, but it is fed the arguments read back from the build's task store,
 and a flag lost on the way (a define, a search path, an upcoming feature) changes what it reports. Only
 agreement on whole real packages shows the arguments arrived intact.

 A comparison that could not fail proves nothing, so the oracle also asks one file again with an injected
 type error and requires that error back at its line. Coverage comes first in the report: files asked,
 files no compile command listed, and files sourcekitd could not answer for are all counted, so a run that
 compared nothing never reads as agreement.
