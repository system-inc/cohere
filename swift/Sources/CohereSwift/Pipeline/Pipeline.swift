/*
 One run: describe the package, then fix and format, types, lint, unused, in that order, each phase's
 outcome stated whether or not it ran.

 The order is cohere's and the reasons are the same. Mutation runs first so everything downstream sees
 the repaired tree. A file that does not parse stops the run there, because rewriting or type-checking a
 tree the parser could not read produces nonsense. Compiler errors stop lint, because rule findings
 against code whose semantics are wrong are noise; compiler warnings do not, because warning-level code
 still means what it says.

 What counts as complete is narrower than "every phase ran". A phase the caller turned off (`--lint`
 alone, `--no-fix`, an opt-in report nobody asked for) withholds nothing they did not choose to withhold.
 A phase that was cut off, a phase that is not built yet, a file that could not be read, or a file the
 compiler left no record for all withhold findings nobody chose to give up, and any of them makes the
 run incomplete and its exit code 1.
