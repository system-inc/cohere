/*
 What this binary is and what it was built from, for the provenance record.

 The swift-syntax and swift-format versions are written down here and in `Package.swift`, and a test
 reads `Package.resolved` and fails if they disagree, because a provenance line that names the wrong
 parser is worse than none: it sends a reader to the wrong source when a finding looks wrong.

 The commit is `dev` unless the release stamped it. Go stamps the TypeScript engine at link time, and
 Swift has no equivalent flag, and a manifest can pass only boolean defines, never a string. So the
 release writes `EngineReleaseStamp.generated.swift` beside this file, holding the 40-hex commit inside
 `#if COHERE_RELEASE_STAMP`, builds with `-Xswiftc -DCOHERE_RELEASE_STAMP`, and removes the file. The file
 is gitignored, so the stamp never marks the tree modified (measured: SwiftPM's `hasUncommittedChanges`
 skips ignored files). Neither half can fail quietly: a build without the define says `dev` even with a
 stale file lying there, and a build with the define and no file does not compile.
