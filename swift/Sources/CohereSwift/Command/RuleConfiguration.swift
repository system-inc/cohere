/*
 Which rules run and at what severity, from the `swift` block of `CohereSettings.json`:

     { "swift": { "rules": { "cohere-swift/force-unwrapping": "error" } } }

 A value is a severity (`error`, `warning`, `off`) or an array whose first element is one, the shape the
 TypeScript config uses. Severities and strictness only, never allow lists or ignore names.

 Formatting is not configured here. Swift has one house format built into the engine (`HouseSwiftFormat`),
 so a `format` key, at the top level or in the `swift` block, is refused by name rather than read or
 ignored: a setting that looks chosen and does nothing is worse than none.

 When the package has no config, every house rule runs at `error`. That is not the permissive default the
 TypeScript loader refuses, because every rule runs, and the note this carries says so on every run, so a
 missing config never reads as a configured clean tree. A config that exists and cannot be read is an
 error, never a fallback to the defaults.
