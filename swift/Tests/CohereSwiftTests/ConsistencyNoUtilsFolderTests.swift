 Fixture pairs for consistency-no-utils-folder, ported from the Go rule's own cases (`consistency_no_utils_folder_test.go`).
 Each path's package root is the directory named `project` on it, as the pipeline would set it. The
 silent cases are the near misses: the spelling the rule asks for, names that contain `utils` without being
 it, a file rather than a folder named `Utils`, and a `utils` above the package.
