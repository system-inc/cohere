 The first typed rule, end to end on a real package, through every way a run can learn what `count` resolves
 to: the build's index, sourcekitd in process for a file the index no longer describes, and neither, which
 must read as unchecked. The negative case is the reason the rule is typed: a struct's own `count` compared
 with zero is not a collection's, and SwiftLint, judging spelling, would flag it.
