/*
 Fixture pairs for `cohere-swift/consistency-no-hand-rolled-delay`, both directions. The reporting fixtures are
 the real sites: the two the survey found in Presence's `CapturePhone/Sources/PhoneRig.swift` as they stand, and
 the spellings each project's primitive replaced, taken from the commits that introduced it (Presence's 47f22c42,
 macOS's 00f1b8e), then the do/catch the other rule's repair would write. Each asserts the line and column where
 the finding starts, so a finding on the wrong node fails rather than passing on its count.

 The silent fixtures are both projects' `sleepUnlessCancelled` verbatim (the definition is not a use), macOS's
 `DelayWidthUntilIdle` debounce (a catch that returns), Presence's `WindowClimb` (a `try` that passes the
 cancellation up), and the near misses each condition exists for.
