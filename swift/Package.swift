// swift-tools-version:6.4

/*
 cohere-swift: the Swift engine behind the `cohere` front door. It fixes, formats, type-checks and lints
 a Swift package in one process and reports what it did as the records `Contract.md` defines. The Go
 front door renders those records exactly as it renders a TypeScript run.

 swift-syntax and swift-format are pinned to one exact release, the one matching the toolchain (604.x
 for Swift 6.4). They come from packages rather than from the toolchain's own `usr/lib/swift/host`
 dylibs because swift-format's library depends on the swift-syntax package. Two copies of `SwiftSyntax`
 cannot share one binary, and the format phase needs swift-format in process. Measured before
 choosing: built this way, swift-format formats byte-identical to `xcrun swift-format` on 952 of our
 files.

import PackageDescription

/*
 Whether the repository this engine is built from had uncommitted changes when it was built.

 Read from the manifest's own git context, the same signal Go's build info gives the TypeScript engine,
 so a binary carrying code no commit holds says so on every run instead of only under `--version`. It
 covers the whole cohere repository, as Go's does. In a tree where other work is in flight that is
 usually true, and the warning is true with it.
