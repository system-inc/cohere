// Package rule_runner runs one of cohere's rules in another program's process, over a program and checker
// that program already holds, so a rule lives once and is never copied (#xjdce2d, #s6z97k8).
//
// Adamic is the caller it was built for: its compiler holds a typescript-go Program and checker through
// cohere's shims, and asks a rule about them rather than re-implementing it in its lowering. The package is
// public, outside internal/, and moves nothing: Go allows a package under github.com/system-inc/cohere to
// import cohere's internal packages, and a module that replaces github.com/system-inc/cohere imports this one.
//
// # The allowlist
//
// Only the rules named in allowed can be run. Every rule added there becomes part of a contract another
// program builds on, so the surface grows by a decision in this file, never by a rule merely existing. A
// rule not on it is refused with NotAllowedError.
//
// # One program at a time
//
// A rule that derives a fact about the whole program caches it process-wide, keyed by the program's
// identity: correctness-no-import-cycle-load-time-read builds its import graph once per program. Calling
// RunRule for one program, then another, rebuilds it. Calling it for two programs at once from two
// goroutines keeps only one of their graphs at a time, so each call rebuilds, and while both are correct,
// neither is fast. Run one program at a time.
