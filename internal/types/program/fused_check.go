// FusedCheck is a cold run's type check done inside the walk: each file is checked on the goroutine that walks
// it, just before its rules run, rather than by the compiler's whole-program check on goroutines of its own
// (#679s763).
//
// # Why
//
// The whole-program check and the walk want the same checkers. Run beside each other, they took turns at
// every checker's lock and doubled the goroutines asking for cores: measured on ahra, the check slowed from
// 1.6s alone to 2.0 to 2.2s beside the walk and format, and became the run's critical path. Fused, one
// goroutine owns a checker at a time, and the rules read types the check computed a moment earlier.
//
// # Why the diagnostics are the same
//
// The compiler's whole-program check is itself a goroutine per checker, checking that checker's files one at
// a time and collecting each file's diagnostics as it finishes it (checkerPool.forEachCheckerGroupDo). A
// file checked alone, on the checker that owns it, is the same call on the same checker. What can differ is
// the order a checker sees its files in, and TestEveryFileWalkedOnAForeignCheckerFindsTheSame and
// CheckReusing's own per-file assembly already hold the diagnostics to not depending on it.
//
// The parts are assembled as AllDiagnosticParts returns them: syntactic diagnostics alone if there are any,
// else bind diagnostics, then every file's semantic diagnostics sorted and deduplicated together, as the
// compiler's whole-program call does.
