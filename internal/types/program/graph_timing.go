// GraphTiming is what building the graph cost, by part, collected when Options.Timing is set.
//
// The graph phase was one number, `graph built in 547ms`, and nobody knew what it was made of
// (#cazsft3). The levers proposed for it were guesses: parallel directory enumeration, a resolution
// cache, a declaration pack. Each is worth something only if its part is a large share, and that is
// what this measures rather than reasons about.
//
// Two kinds of number, and they must not be read as one:
//
//   - Wall: Config, Program and Verify are each one stretch of the build's own goroutine, and they add
//     up to most of the phase.
//   - Summed: the compiler loads files on many goroutines at once, so the time spent inside its loads
//     and inside the disk is summed across all of them and runs far past Program's wall. It says
//     where the loaders' work goes, not how long anyone waited.
//
// Parse and module resolution are not separable from here. Both run inside the compiler's file
// loader, interleaved per file, behind one call. What can be measured from outside is each load,
// which is a read and a parse, and the disk beneath it; resolution and the loader's own bookkeeping
// are the part of Program's wall those leave unexplained.
