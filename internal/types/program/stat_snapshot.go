// StatSnapshot holds what the run cache's check found at every path it statted: a file or a directory with its
// stat, or nothing there. A run the check could not replay has just statted every input it recorded, the files
// the last build read, the directories holding them and the paths it looked for and did not find, and the build
// that follows asks the disk the same questions again. Two consumers read the answers instead (#kdee854):
//
//   - the content pack validates a file it serves against the check's stat rather than taking one: about 18ms of
//     a graph phase's 32ms of serving on ahra, at 12 workers;
//   - the build's existence checks and stats are answered from it (Options.CheckedStats), most of all module
//     resolution's, which asks whether a path exists about 35,000 times on an ahra edit run and is told no for
//     most of them, two stats each beneath the recorder.
//
// It is sound because nothing the run reads can be newer than its clock. The run-cache clock starts before the
// check (startRunCacheClock), so a path that changed after its stat here, a file edited or a file created where
// the build was told nothing is, moved its own times or its directory's past the run's readSince, and either
// RecordRunCache refuses to record that run or the next run's check finds the absent path present. Every other
// cache keys on what the build actually saw. The run reports the tree as it stood at the check, and nothing
// replays it past a later change.
//
// The one writer that clock cannot see is the run itself. A graph rebuilt after the fix phase rewrote files must
// not read through a snapshot taken before the rewrite (distrustCheckStats in the command).
