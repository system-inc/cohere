// The cache table: everything cohere keeps between runs for one project root, in one directory.
//
// It holds the run cache's recorded runs, one per invocation, the findings cache's per-file entries, the
// shapes, the format record and the types section. Each section keeps its own key and its own proof, and
// each lives in a file of its own with its own header, so a run reads and writes only the sections it
// uses (#45ekc65).
//
// # Why a file per section
//
// They shared one file until 2026-10-04, and replacing any section re-encoded all of them. Measured on
// ahra's 16 MB table: the format record encodes alone in 0.5ms, and saving it cost a 15ms read and a 21ms
// write of everything else. Three quarters of the bytes were the recorded runs, about 38,000 inputs per
// invocation, which only a replay reads, and only its own. Since every section carries its own proof, no
// section depends on another being written in the same instant, so the files need no atomicity across
// them: each is written whole and renamed into place, and the table's lock (command/cohere) keeps a reader
// from seeing one writer's run beside another's findings.
//
// # Why gob
//
// The two JSON files were 7.9 MB and 1.45 MB on ahra, decoding in 14ms and 3ms and encoding in 7ms and
// 25ms. Measured on #6tfmk0b: decode was about 6% of a replay, so speed was not the reason. The reason is
// that gob is written by reflection over the structs themselves. The lint cache's history is an encoder
// that forgot a field, shipped four times across a hand-written binary layout and a JSON one, and a
// format nobody writes by hand cannot forget a field.
//
// # The one way gob can lie, and the guard
//
// gob matches fields by name and skips what it does not recognize, in both directions. A field renamed,
// added or removed decodes without error into a zero value, which is the silent-default failure this
// format was chosen to escape, arriving by another door. So every file's header carries cacheTableVersion,
// and TestCacheTableShapeIsPinnedToItsVersion fails whenever the shape of what is encoded changes and the
// version does not. A changed shape always arrives as a discard, never as a partial read.
//
// # Discard, never repair
//
// Each file's header names the format, the cohere commit, the compiler commit, the Go toolchain, the
// platform that wrote it, and the section it holds. Any of them differing, a decode error, or a byte left
// over after the body is a discard of that file alone: the run reads the section as empty, says so once on
// stderr, and its next write of the section replaces the file. A discard costs one ordinary run. A repaired
// cache that is wrong costs a green run over a broken tree. The single file the table used to be,
// table.gob, is removed on sight and never read.
//
// One exception, and it is narrow. A format record written by another cohere commit, with the same format,
// compiler, toolchain and platform, is kept, while every other file from that commit is dropped. The format
// record is keyed by the formatter's own identity (FormatSection.Key), which moves only when the formatter
// can print differently, so a cohere commit that never touched the formatter need not reformat every file.
// The encoding is still guaranteed by the format version, so nothing here reads a field from the wrong
// place.
