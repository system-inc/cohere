// IncrementalSession is one warm-capable pass over a graph: check, then persist what the next
// run needs to know which files it can skip.
//
// It exists as a type rather than as two methods on Graph because of the single most
// expensive thing to get wrong here. The build info must be emitted from the SAME incremental
// program that performed the checking. That program's snapshot records which files it
// checked, and the emit writes those records; a build info emitted from a freshly-wrapped
// program has an empty snapshot, so it marks every file as "unchanged but never checked",
// which on load means "check it".
//
// Measured, because the difference does not look like anything from the call site:
//
//	emitted from a fresh wrapper     warm semantic pass 712ms, nothing skipped
//	emitted from the checker         warm semantic pass   4ms
//
// The first version of this file had two independent methods and produced the 712ms. It was
// correct, it was slower than not caching at all, and every test passed. Holding the program
// across both calls is what makes the type worth its weight.
//
// THE RISK, stated where the code is rather than in a task nobody will read: a cache that
// fails to invalidate reports zero findings forever, and that is indistinguishable from a
// clean tree on every measurement except a planted violation. "Cold equals warm" does not test
// it, because a permanently-stale cache passes that too. The test that matters is
// warm-after-a-change, in incremental_test.go.

// load, upstream seeds a "no diagnostics" entry for every file whose hash still matches, and

// constructing it, so the caller has already paid the graph phase before calling this.

// Write persists what the next run needs to tell changed files from unchanged ones.
//
// It costs about 146ms on ahra warm, and the cost is CPU rather than disk. Measured by
// instrumenting inside upstream's emitBuildInfo:
//
//	snapshotToBuildInfo   104ms   walking the snapshot
//	json.Marshal            9ms   3.5 MB of JSON
//	the write itself       0.4ms
//
// Writing 3.5 MB on this machine is 0.5ms, ten trials. So "the cache rewrites an unchanged file
// every run" is true and is not worth fixing: skipping the write when the bytes match was built,
// measured, and reverted, because reading the old file to compare costs more than the write it
// avoids (blocked A/B, six runs each: 362ms median unchanged against 371ms with the skip).
//
// Upstream's own already-up-to-date check cannot fire for us and that is not a bug to fix here:
// buildInfoEmitPending is initialized true for any incremental config with no in-memory
// predecessor (programtosnapshot.go:69) and set true again unconditionally after semantic
// diagnostics (program.go:319). Both are correct for the watch process it was written for. cohere
// is one-shot, so a fresh snapshot every run means the flag is structurally always true.
//
// The remaining cost lives in rebuilding state a resident process would still hold -- the 204ms
// parse in NewIncrementalSession and the 104ms snapshot walk here are the same expense paid at
// both ends. Neither is reachable without deciding whether cohere stays one-shot. See #hfv0ae3.
//
// Call it after Diagnostics, on the same session. Calling it before, or on a different
// session, produces a build info that records nothing as checked and a warm run that skips
// nothing, which costs more than not caching at all.
//
// Cohere does not otherwise emit, and this does not change that: under NoEmit the emit path
// writes the build info and no JavaScript.
//
// Returns any diagnostics from the write itself. A failed write must not pass silently: the
// next run would be cold while this one reported success, and the symptom is a saving that
// never appears rather than an error anyone can see.
