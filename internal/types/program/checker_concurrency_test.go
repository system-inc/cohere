// A rule that asks the checker a question must not crash the run, and this needs enough files to
// actually run several workers.
//
// The failure this guards is not a panic. `dispatchFileSafely` recovers a panicking rule into one
// lost file with a coverage note, and that recover does nothing here: calling the checker from the
// parallel walk produced `fatal error: concurrent map read and map write` inside upstream's own
// `core.LinkStore.Get`, and a concurrent map access is a runtime fatal error rather than a panic. The
// process died with no coverage line, no phase line, and no partial result.
//
// It went unnoticed because **no rule in the catalog had ever called the checker.** Ninety-three
// rules, zero type queries, so the type-aware path had never executed. Every existing guard here
// exercises only code that exists.
//
// The cause was `GetTypeCheckerForFile` rather than `GetTypeCheckerForFileExclusive`. Upstream
// documents the difference and we were on the wrong side of it: the exclusive form is "locked to the
// current thread to prevent data races from multiple threads accessing the same checker". The walk
// already acquired per file and released after, which looked correct and was not, because ownership
// is by position in the program's full file list while the walk strides over a filtered subset.
//
// The existing checker test uses one file, so it runs one worker and could never have caught this.
// **The file count is the instrument here**, which is why it is written out rather than trimmed to
// something tidier.
