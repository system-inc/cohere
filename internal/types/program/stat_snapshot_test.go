// A build answered from the run cache's check builds the program a build asking the disk builds, both ways
// (#kdee854). Module resolution decides which files are in the program at all, so a wrong answer here is a wrong
// program, and the case that must not be missed is a module created since the last run: the last build looked for
// it and was told nothing is there.
//
// The tsconfig names only index.ts, which imports './helper'. The first build resolves it to helper/index.ts,
// having looked for helper.ts and found nothing. Then helper.ts is created. The check stats every recorded path
// again, helper.ts among them, so a build answered from it must resolve './helper' to helper.ts, as the disk
// does. A snapshot that kept the recorded "nothing there" instead, built by hand below, resolves it to the old
// file, which is what proves the comparison can fail. And on the untouched tree the answered build matches too,
// with the check answering most of its questions.
