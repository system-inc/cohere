// The lint findings cache: what each rule reported about one file, replayed when neither the
// file nor the rule set has changed.
//
// This is the cheapest of the three caches to make correct, and the reason is worth stating
// because it does not hold for the other two. A pure rule's findings are a function of exactly
// one file's bytes. Same bytes, same rule, same findings, with nothing else in the world able
// to change the answer. So the key is a content hash and there is no invalidation graph.
//
// The word doing the work there is "pure". A rule that reads other files is not, and caching
// it under one file's hash serves a stale result forever when the OTHER file changes. Two live
// rules are cross-file today, and a third case is latent: the upstream adapter hands the whole
// program to every rule it wraps and cannot inspect what it wrapped, so it can never truthfully
// declare purity for a body it does not own.
//
// That is what CacheableRules exists to decide, and why it defaults to excluding rather than
// including. The asymmetry is the same one the codebase already chose for the type checker:
// under-declaring serves a stale finding silently and forever, over-declaring costs a cache
// miss. One of those is a correctness failure and the other is a performance one.
//
// It is wired as the run cache's second layer: when an eligible run's inputs are not all unchanged, files
// whose bytes and configuration are unchanged are walked with only their uncacheable rules, and the
// cacheable rules' findings and coverage are replayed. See FindingsReuse.
//
// It was measured and left unwired once, and the reversal is worth keeping because the measurement
// method is the same and only the tree changed. On 2026-08-25, with 212 rules, walking with only the
// uncacheable ones saved about 9%: the walk visits every node whatever the rule set, so with light
// rules there was little left to skip. On 2026-10-02, with 464 rules, the same experiment on ahra's real
// config, each walk on a freshly built graph:
//
//	walk, all 464 rules                     about 2.56s
//	walk, the 45 ReadsProgram rules only    about 1.37s
//
// The second line is the ceiling for a fully cached run, since ReadsProgram rules always run. It was
// first published here as 0.4s, measured on a graph whose earlier walks had already paid for type
// checking: the checker computes types lazily and whichever walk asks first pays, so a later walk looks
// cheap for a reason that has nothing to do with its rules. Every walk is now on a fresh graph. A real
// one-file-changed run on ahra saved about 1.1s of the fix phase, close to that ceiling.
//
// The node count is identical across rule sets, so the walk itself still cannot be skipped; what grew
// is the work rules do at each node. Type-aware rules are cached on a type fingerprint as well as the
// file's bytes; see CacheClasses and Graph.TypeFingerprints.
//
// Two kinds of file are never served from cache. A file with any suppression directive, because a
// directive's accounting spans every rule in the file, cached and walked alike. A file with any
// finding that carries a fix or a suggestion, because a cached finding stores neither and the fix
// phase needs the edit itself.

	// Findings is what the cacheable rules reported. Empty is a real answer: it means the rules ran

}

// LintCacheFinding is one finding, flattened.
//
// rule.Diagnostic carries a *ast.SourceFile belonging to a program that no longer exists by
// the time this is read back, so the file is implied by the entry rather than stored per
// finding.
//
// MessageDescription holds the rendered text. An earlier version of this comment said text was
// "derived from the id when a finding is rendered" and therefore safe to omit. That was untrue,
// and the field was absent because of it. Nothing in this tree derives text from an id: there is
// no id-to-text table, and `printRuleDiagnostic` prints `Message.Description` directly. Measured
// 2026-08-25 over `internal/rules`: 340 message ids, of which 11 build their description with
// `fmt.Sprintf` from runtime values, so for those one id maps to many strings and no table could
// exist. A cached finding replaying only the id would print an empty or wrong sentence beside a
// correct file, range and rule — the right metadata carrying the wrong message, which is the one
// failure here that looks exactly like success.
//
// The text is stored rather than the 11 being refused because refusing them buys bytes with a
// standing per-rule obligation, and this format already depends on `ReadsProgram` carrying one.
// The size scales the right way: the artifact grows with a dirty tree, which is the run where
// this cache saves least, because changed files are recomputed anyway.
//
// Message ids are not unique on their own, which is a second reason the id could never have been
// the key. `unexpected` carries five distinct descriptions across six core rules, colliding across
// rules and never within one, so the honest identity of a message is the pair (RuleName,
// MessageId). Lookups key on the pair even though the text is now stored, so nobody later assumes
// ids are unique.
//
// Fixes and suggestions are counted rather than stored, and that omission IS sound: a fix is a
// replacement over a byte range, and replaying one computed against different bytes would corrupt
// the file it claims to repair. A cached finding is a report, never an edit.

// (sortDiagnostics in walk.go); rule order never decided it.
//
// The conclusion survives the correction on different grounds. A reordered rule set can change
// which findings EXIST rather than merely their sequence, because fixes applied by an earlier
// rule change the text a later rule reads, and suppression directives are consumed in the order
// rules run. So a cache keyed without rule order could replay a set the current configuration
// would not produce, which is what this hash prevents.

// Versions 1 and 2 were a binary layout of offsets into an interned blob, replaced because adding
