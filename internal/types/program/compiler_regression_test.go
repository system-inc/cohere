// Behaviour the pinned compiler must have, tested against the checker this package links rather than
// trusted from the commit it was pinned for. Each case names the upstream report it guards, so a
// failure here says which fix is missing rather than only that a count changed.

// microsoft/TypeScript#64593, fixed by #64594. Reverse-mapped inference copied a class's private
// members into the inferred type as public ones, so since #63932 (intersection properties take the
// most permissive accessibility) `getAccount() as Account` reported TS2352. tsc 6.0.3 accepts it.
//
// cohere is pinned to the fix commit on kirkouimet/TypeScript while the PR is open, because upstream
// main still has the defect. This is what fails if the pin moves back to upstream before Microsoft
// merges, and it stays after they do. It was found on two Base authentication casts of this shape.
