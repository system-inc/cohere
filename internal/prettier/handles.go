// Package prettier formats source by running our own Prettier fork inside a JavaScript engine.
//
// The fork at ~/Projects/system/prettier is what formats this codebase today, so running it is the
// only way to be byte-identical with the gate we are replacing rather than merely close to it. The
// alternative that was measured and rejected was typescript-go's own formatter: FormatCodeSettings
// has no printWidth field and no line-breaking engine at all, and 21.8% of tracked files diverge
// from our Prettier after every settings-reachable fix.

// parserForExtension maps a file extension to the Prettier parser that handles it.
//
// This is the whole of what the engine can format, and it is deliberately a table rather than a
// try-and-see. A caller needs to know whether a file is a candidate before formatting it, and
// learning by attempting means running the formatter to discover it should not have run.
//
// package.json is not in here because it is not an extension question: Prettier infers the
// json-stringify parser for that one filename specifically, which preserves npm's own array
// formatting. Keying off the extension alone gives it the plain json parser and reformats the file
// away from what the existing gate produces. That is measured, not theoretical -- it is the one
// disagreement in 1,556 files when the probe got it wrong.
