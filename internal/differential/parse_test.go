// Tests for the text-to-structure layer, fed output the two gates actually printed.
//
// This is a separate file from differential_test.go because it defends a different failure. Those
// tests prove the comparison can detect a difference given findings. These prove findings exist to
// compare at all.
//
// The gap matters more than it looks. Every parse failure in this layer is silent by construction:
// a regex that stops matching yields zero findings, and zero findings on one side makes every
// finding on the other look one-sided while the diff stays perfectly well-formed. A path
// normalization bug does the same thing — cohere prints absolute paths, the gate prints relative
// ones, and if they fail to reconcile then two identical findings never match and the harness
// reports total disagreement in a shape that looks like a working result.
//
// So the inputs below are copied from real runs on the ahra tree at 01:16 on 2026-08-23, not
// written to match the patterns. A parser tested only against its author's idea of the format is a
// parser tested against nothing.

// — `typescript/no-explicit-any` — where the part after the slash is the rule and the part before
// it is the plugin. The two conventions collide, and the collision is silent: the name still
// parses, still compares, and simply refers to the wrong thing.
//
// This test used to document the boundary rather than assert the collision was handled, and it
// named the exact moment it would bite: "if a future reader wires rule catalogs from the config
// into Inputs.ConfiguredRules." That happened at 01:48 when cohere-differential was first pointed
// at the real tree. Every config key collapsed to its plugin, the configured-rule set became three
// junk names, and every rule read as unconfigured, so the per-rule table labelled an enabled rule
// not-configured. It surfaced as one wrong word and would have excused every real disagreement.
//
// It is handled now. The two conventions are told apart by shape rather than by a plugin list, so
