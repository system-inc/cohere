// A slash means two opposite things depending on who wrote it, and getting it wrong does not look
// like a parse failure.
//
// `NormalizeRuleName` had no test at all, which is how a bug survived the fix written for it. The
// original defect collapsed every config key to its plugin, so the configured set became
// `{nexus, structure, typescript}` and every genuine disagreement was excused as not-configured. The
// fix told the two forms apart by looking for a hyphen in the first segment, and that was right for
// every plugin whose name has no hyphen.
//
// **`better-tailwindcss` has one.** So all eight of its rules collapsed to `better-tailwindcss` and
// the family read as unconfigured, which is the same failure in a narrower form. It survived because
// nothing here asserted the plugin-prefixed direction on a hyphenated plugin name.
//
// The distinguishing shape is the second segment: a message id is camelCase and therefore never
// hyphenated, so a hyphen after the slash means the config's `plugin/rule-name` form.
