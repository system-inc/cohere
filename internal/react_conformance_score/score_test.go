// Package react_conformance_score runs verify's actual React rules against React's own error goldens.
//
// # Why this is a separate package
//
// `internal/react_conformance` owns the corpus, the expectation parser, and the categories. It
// deliberately depends on nothing in verify's rule engine, so that the instrument cannot be bent by
// the thing it measures — and so that its 0.3s suite stays cheap enough never to be gated.
//
// Running a real rule costs a TypeScript program build, which is roughly a second per fixture.
// Putting that in the same package would either make the instrument slow enough to gate, or push
// someone to skip the build and hand rules a nil checker, which is the vacuous-probe failure
// `rule_testing.RunTyped` was written to prevent. So the expensive half lives here, alone.
//
// # What this proves that the categorisation cannot
//
// `react_conformance` can decide, from the corpus alone, which fixtures a shipped rule is
// responsible for. It cannot decide whether those rules are RIGHT, and a harness that only ever
// reported "94 addressable, 0 scored" would be a taxonomy wearing a scoreboard's clothes.
//
// This scores one rule end to end against real goldens, so the wiring from fixture to finding to
// verdict is demonstrated on real input rather than on constructed test doubles. `globals` was
// chosen because it is syntax-only: it needs no `@types/react`, so its score measures the rule
// rather than the corpus's missing imports.

// fixtureRoot reaches into the sibling package's vendored corpus.

// TestGlobalsScoresAgainstReactsOwnGoldens is the end-to-end proof.
//
// It runs verify's real `react/globals` over every fixture in the corpus whose diagnostics all
// belong to upstream's `globals` rule, and requires the harness to produce a non-zero pass count.
//
// The assertion is a floor rather than an exact number, and that choice is deliberate in one
// direction only. An exact number would be the better assertion — it is what
// `TestAttributionIsAMeasurementNotAGuess` does — but it would pin the SPAN and LINE conventions of
// a rule that was never written against this corpus, turning any future span refinement into a
// failure here rather than where it belongs. A floor still fails for the thing this test exists to
// catch: a harness that cannot turn a real rule's real finding into a pass.
//
// What it proves, precisely: the join from corpus to fixture to program to rule to finding to
// comparison to verdict is closed, on real input, with a real type graph. Everything else in this
// package is categorisation, and categorisation cannot tell you it is wired to anything.
