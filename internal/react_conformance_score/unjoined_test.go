// TestUnjoinedMessageIdsAreEnumerated measures what the message join DROPS.
//
// `Analyze` skips a finding whose message id is not in the rule's table, which is the right default
// — a wrong join manufactures a confident false failure — but it is silent, and silence about
// dropped findings is exactly what this harness exists to refuse. A rule could find the right thing
// under an unjoined id and score as a miss, and nothing would say so.
//
// This enumerates the drops instead. It exists because a mutation making unjoined ids map to a
// default message SURVIVED the whole suite: nothing could see the join's behaviour on an id outside
// the table, in either direction.

	// same time and the two always agreed: a control mutation dropping a real, exercised entry
	// SURVIVED twice. Both sides moved together, which reads exactly like a correct join. Assert
	// against a literal you typed, never against the constant the code under test reports with.
