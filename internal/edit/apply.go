// Package fix applies the repairs rules propose, and refuses the ones that would corrupt a file.
//
// This is the only component in cohere that writes to source. Everything else reads: the parser
// reads bytes, the checker reads the parse, a rule reads the tree and proposes. A proposal is
// inert until this package decides it lands, which is what lets a rule be written by anyone and
// still be safe — a rule cannot damage a file it has no way to write to.
//
// The gate this replaces ran oxlint in check mode even during `lint fix`, and its own comment said
// why: an unaudited fixer writing across every file is the widest blast radius in the tool. That
// was avoidance rather than a solution. The solution is four guards, each answering a way a fixer
// silently corrupts source rather than failing:
//
//   - Overlap. Two rules want the same bytes. One wins by a stated rule, or neither lands.
//   - Offsets. The first applied fix shifts every later one. Applying back to front means no
//     surviving fix is ever measured against text that moved under it.
//   - Refusal. The rewritten text is parsed before it is written, and discarded if it does not
//     parse. This is the guard that makes autofix safe at all.
//   - Atomicity. Temp file plus rename, so a reader sees the old file or the new one and never a
//     half-written one. Five agents work in this tree at once.
//
// The safety property the rest rests on: a fix here lands in a working tree, is read in review,
// and becomes a commit. A bad rewrite is visible before it ships. That is the reason refusal can
// be the only hard stop rather than one of many.
