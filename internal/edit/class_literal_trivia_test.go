// One rule's bad range costs every rule's fixes in that file, and a class literal after trivia was
// that bad range.
//
// The parse guard refuses a pass whole, which is the right guarantee and has a price: a single fix
// whose range is wrong takes every other fix in the same file down with it. classLiteralFrom took a
// literal's Loc, whose start sits before the leading whitespace, so for a literal on its own line
// the quote strip cut the opening quote instead of the first class character. The rewrite stopped
// parsing and the engine refused the whole pass, the import fix below included. Measured by
// @system_cohere_format_markdown on perturbed input (#vf1hd6j): 174 files and 1,755 refused fixes in
// ahra, 175 files and 1,932 in www-phi-health. Fixed in cohere c079219.
//
// The rule-level fixture in the tailwind package proves the quote survives. This proves the outcome
// the bug was measured by: two rules, one file, both fixes landing, nothing refused. Mutation check,
// run when this was written: restoring `contentRange := literal.Loc` in classLiteralFrom turns this
// red with both fixes refused for a parse failure, and the file left as it was.
