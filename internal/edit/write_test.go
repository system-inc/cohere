// Atomicity is the one guard whose absence is invisible in a single-threaded test: writing in place
// produces the same final bytes as temp-plus-rename, so every assertion about the result passes
// either way. The difference only appears to a concurrent reader, which is exactly the situation
// this repo is in — several agents editing one tree, where a half-written file failing to build and
// then healing two minutes later was observed rather than imagined.
//
// So the test reads the file continuously while it is rewritten, and asserts that every read saw a
// complete version. An in-place write fails this: os.WriteFile truncates and then fills, so a
// reader landing in that window sees a prefix, or nothing.
//
// Confirmed to fail: replacing WriteAtomically's body with os.WriteFile makes this test report
// torn reads. That mutation passes every other test in this package, which is why this one exists.
