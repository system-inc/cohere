// always-on because the closure makes a strictly stronger claim that fails differently: see the
// note on `computeIslands`.
//
// The two halves are computed together and printed together because they read as one question to a
// person — "what did I write that is not doing anything" — while being two analyses with different
// evidence behind them. The report keeps them in separate sections precisely so the reader can trust
// them differently, which is the honest presentation of two claims of unequal strength.

// This is the class that would have done the most damage to the report's credibility. On the ahra
// tree, 532 locale files live under `translations/` directories and are loaded exclusively as
// `import(`@structure/source/.../translations/${localeCode}`)`. Not one of them has a static import
// anywhere. A reference index without this treats every one as unused, and a report whose first
// screen is 532 live translation files is a report nobody reads to the second screen.
//
// The specifier is computed at runtime, so no static analysis can resolve which file a given
// `${localeCode}` selects. The honest move is therefore to root the whole directory the literal
// prefix points into, rather than to pretend a reference was found or to resolve a specifier that
// genuinely is not knowable until the program runs.
