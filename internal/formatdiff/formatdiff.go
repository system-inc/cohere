// Package formatdiff measures typescript-go's formatter against the Prettier fork that formats this
// codebase today.
//
// This exists because the question it answers decides whether `verify --format` can replace
// Prettier at all, and the answer cannot come from reading either implementation. Both are large,
// both are correct about different things, and a formatter that silently reflows a tree produces a
// diff nobody asked for that buries real changes in noise. So the deliverable is a measurement over
// real files, and the taxonomy of what differs rather than the count.
//
// The corpus is the ahra tree, which `s pnc` keeps formatted by @system-inc/prettier. Every file in
// it is a fixed point of that formatter, which is what makes it usable as an oracle: any change
// FormatDocument proposes against an already-formatted file is, by construction, a divergence.
