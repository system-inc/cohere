// Three rules judge comments rather than nodes, and a comment is not a node: it is trivia the
// parser skips, recorded only as a range in the source text. So they cannot register a listener for
// it, and each would otherwise write its own scan. This is that scan, written once.

// Comment is one comment in a file: where it is, what kind it is, and its text.
type Comment struct {
	Range core.TextRange

	// IsBlock distinguishes a slash-star comment from a double-slash one. JSDoc is a block comment
	// whose text opens with an asterisk, so the two rules that care about JSDoc need this to tell
	// the shapes apart.
	IsBlock bool

	// Text is the full source text of the comment, delimiters included. Rules that want the inner
	// content strip the delimiters themselves, because what counts as content differs by rule: the
	// JSDoc rule wants the asterisk-prefixed lines, the line-length rule wants the whole line.
	Text string

	// StartLine, StartColumn, and EndLine are zero-based positions. The run-detecting rule needs
	// them to answer two questions no range can: whether two comments sit on adjacent lines, and
	// whether they start at the same column, which is what separates a stacked passage from a
	// trailing comment that happens to follow another.
	StartLine   int
	StartColumn int
	EndLine     int
}

// All returns every comment in a file, in source order, without duplicates.
//
// The parser skips trivia, so there is no list to read; the comments have to be rescanned out of
// the source text. The scan walks from position zero and from the start of every node, because the
// scanner's iterator yields the run of comments beginning at a position and stops at the first
// token. Positions repeat across a walk (a node and its first child usually start at the same
// place), so the results are deduplicated by range rather than assumed distinct.
// # Comments inside an otherwise-empty pair of delimiters
//
// A node's `Pos()` is where its leading trivia begins and its `End()` is past its closing token, so
// both sit *outside* the delimiters. When the thing between the delimiters is empty there is no
// child node to anchor a position inside them, and a comment sitting there was invisible to this
// scan. Measured: `switch(foo) { case 0: { /* falls through */ } case 1: b(); }` returned zero
// comments, and that input is one of upstream's clean cases for `no-fallthrough`.
//
// The gap was wider than the empty *block* it was first reported as. Nine shapes were measured
// silent, including `class A { /* c */ }`, `interface I { /* c */ }`, `enum E { /* c */ }`,
// `f( /* c */ )` and `function g(/* c */) {}`, none of which involve a block at all. What they share
// is an empty `NodeList`, not an empty block.
//
// The fix is `collectListInteriors`, which anchors on the empty list's own `Pos()`. The parser
// records that position between the delimiters whether or not the list has elements, so it is the
// interior anchor the walk was missing.
//
// It costs. Measured over 300 real files, three runs each: 5.45ms per pass before, 6.44ms after, so
// about 18%, and the whole-tree `--timing` run agrees at 95.9ms against 116ms for `comments.All`
// across 3,407 files. That is the price of a comment scan that can no longer go silent, paid once
// per file and shared by every rule that asks. The work itself is small and the checking is most of
// it: 195,800 nodes own 12,975 lists, of which only 1,547 are empty and actually reach the scanner.
//
// # Why the anchor has to come from the parser
//
// A cheaper-looking fix is to sweep the text for `/` characters the walk did not cover and scan
// from each. It was tried and it is wrong: on `const s = 'http://x'; // real` it invented a comment
// `//x'; // real` out of the `//` inside the string literal. Only the parser knows which slashes are
// code, so every anchor here is one the parser handed us. That is also why `canBeginAt` is allowed
// to be an over-approximation while this is not: the guard only ever *declines* to scan a position
// the walk already trusted, whereas a text sweep would *invent* positions the walk never saw.

// parser already knows the position that would answer: every delimited child sequence is a
// `NodeList`, and a `NodeList` carries its own `Pos()` recorded *inside* the delimiters whether or
// not it holds any elements. `ForEachChild` flattens a list into its elements and discards the
