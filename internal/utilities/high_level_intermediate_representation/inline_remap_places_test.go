// TestCopyNestedBodyLeavesTheNestedFunctionsPlacesUntouched is the sibling of
// `TestCopyNestedBodyLeavesTheNestedFunctionUntouched`, and it exists because that test's shape was
// not enough.
//
// That test asserts over block REFERENCES. It caught a shared terminal pointer, which is real. But
// the same aliasing existed one field over and it was invisible to a block-reference assertion:
// `Instruction.Value` is an interface holding a pointer, the copy assigned it directly, and
// `EachInstructionPlacePointer` then rewrote the operands of the NESTED function's instruction
// rather than the copy's.
//
// Measured before the fix, on the fixture below: ten of nineteen places in the nested body had been
// renamed to the parent's identifiers, and printing the nested function panicked with an index past
// the end of its own identifier table. Nothing else in the package saw it, because the parent -- the
// thing every caller looks at -- was correct.
//
// The assertion is therefore over places, and over the nested function rather than the parent. The
// nested function is the control: `CopyNestedBodyInto` promises to copy, and a copy that renames its
// source has not copied.

	// and this test would pass against the defect it exists to catch.
