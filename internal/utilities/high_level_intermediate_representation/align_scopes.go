// Aligning reactive scopes to block scopes: widening a scope out to the construct it straddles.
//
// This is React's `alignReactiveScopesToBlockScopesHIR` (development bundle line 43256), run over
// this graph. oxc transcribes it at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_reactive_scopes/align_reactive_scopes_to_block_scopes_hir.rs`;
// where the two disagree React wins, and each disagreement is recorded at the line that resolves it.
//
// # Why this pass exists, which is a precondition rather than an optimisation
//
// `assertValidBlockNesting` does not compare scopes against each other. It builds one combined item
// list -- every scope, PLUS a `ProgramBlockSubtree` for every block that has a fallthrough, spanning
// from that block's terminal to the first instruction of the fallthrough -- and asserts that every
// pair in that list is disjoint or nested (bundle lines 20954-20969). A scope that begins inside an
// `if` and ends after it crosses the construct's boundary without containing it, and the assertion
// stops the compiler.
//
// `MergeOverlappingReactiveScopes` closed the scope-against-scope half and measured that it is not
// enough. Re-derived here independently, over 400 corpus files and 677 outermost functions:
//
//	                              pre-merge   merge alone   this pass THEN the merge
//	scope against scope                  39             0                          0
//	the FULL assertion                  222           163                          1
//
// The counts differ slightly from the ones `merge_scopes.go` records -- it measured 40, 226 and 166
// over 685 functions -- because the corpus is a live tree that moved between the two measurements.
// Both are correct about the tree they saw, which is why this file states its own denominator rather
// than inheriting one. The SHAPE is identical and that is the part that matters.
//
// The 163 attributed by kind before this pass runs: 87 `ProgramBlockSubtree` inside a `Scope`, 75
// `Scope` inside a `ProgramBlockSubtree`, and 1 `ProgramBlockSubtree` against itself. This pass
// resolves the first two and structurally cannot touch the third: it writes only `scope.range`, and
// never modifies a block. See `AlignGapFallthroughSelfNesting` for the residue, which is a property
// of this lowering's fallthrough layout rather than of any scope pass.
//
// # ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: this pass MUST run BEFORE the merge, and measuring that is how it was found
//
// Upstream's order is alignment (line 50201) then merge (line 50207) then the assertion (50213), and
// oxc agrees (`pipeline.rs:289/291`). Our merge shipped first, so the obvious thing was to land this
// behind it and the obvious thing is WRONG. Measured over 400 corpus files and 685 functions, both
// orders run side by side against the same assertion:
//
//	order                          FULL assertion   scope-vs-scope   merge unions   scopes widened
//	merge then align (naive)                   30                4             87              608
//	align then merge (upstream)                 1                0            412              652
//
// Only upstream's order reaches the residue. The mechanism is not subtle once the numbers are in
// front of you: this pass WIDENS ranges, and widening CREATES overlaps. Running the merge first
// resolves the overlaps that exist before any widening, and then this pass introduces four new
// scope-against-scope violations that nothing is left to close -- the merge's own output is no longer
// a fixpoint of the merge. Running it second, the merge sweeps over already-widened ranges and its
// union count rises from 87 to 412, which is the same 47-scope lesson `merge_scopes.go` records about
// its own algorithm arriving one level up: a pass measured in isolation can be correct and still be
// wrong about what it composes with.
//
// So the merge MUST be re-run behind this pass rather than reused. `AlignThenMergeReactiveScopes`
// below is the composed spelling and is what a consumer should call.
// `TestAlignMustRunBeforeTheMerge` pins both rows of that table, so a future reordering fails loudly
// rather than silently costing 30 violations.
//
// # The four widening mechanisms, each measured separately
//
// A reader who takes "snap scopes out to block boundaries" as the whole algorithm will write one of
// these and miss three. They are, in the order the sweep reaches them:
//
//	the fallthrough POP        entering a block that closes an open construct pulls every still-
//	                           active scope's START back to that construct's terminal id
//	the fallthrough PUSH       a terminal with a fallthrough pushes every still-active scope's END
//	                           out to the fallthrough's first instruction
//	the goto BACK-REFERENCE    a goto targeting a fallthrough that is open but not innermost widens
//	                           both ends at once
//	the value-block RANGE      a scope first seen inside a value block (a ternary arm, a logical
//	                           right-hand side) is widened to that whole value block's span
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: `branch` is excluded, and here that exclusion is what makes our graph legal
//
// Upstream widens on `fallthrough !== null && terminal.kind !== 'branch'`. Measured against React
// itself rather than read off the source, by running the pass out of the 7.1.1 development bundle on
// hand-built graphs identical but for the terminal kind:
//
//	if       [4,6) -> [4,9)     widens
//	ternary  [4,6) -> [4,9)     widens
//	logical  [4,6) -> [4,9)     widens
//	branch   [4,6) -> [4,6)     does NOT widen
//
// That exclusion governs the largest terminal population in this tree rather than a corner case.
// Measured over 400 corpus files: 1,723 `Branch` terminals carry a fallthrough, against 752 `If`,
// 1,072 `Logical`, 503 `Ternary`, 126 `ForOf`, 32 `For`, 16 `Switch`, 9 `Try` and 1 `While`.
//
// It is also load-bearing for a reason upstream states as an invariant. React asserts
// `!valueBlockNodes.has(fallthrough)` -- "Expect hir blocks to have unique fallthroughs" -- and that
// assertion sits INSIDE the non-branch guard. Our lowering pairs each `If`, `Ternary` and `Logical`
// with a `Branch` carrying the SAME fallthrough id, so a fallthrough is reached twice. Measured:
// 1,723 fallthroughs are reused by two terminals, and 0 of those reuses involve a non-branch
// terminal. So excluding `branch` is exactly what makes upstream's uniqueness invariant hold here.
// React's own lowering does the same thing (bundle line 23129 lowers a `for` test to a `branch`
// whose fallthrough is the shared continuation block), so this is agreement rather than divergence.
// `TestAlignFallthroughsAreUniqueOnceBranchesAreExcluded` pins both halves.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: the widening MINIMISES here, and it is safe for a DIFFERENT reason than
// # the merge's
//
// Three adjacent passes have now given three different answers to adopt-versus-minimise, so this one
// was established by RUNNING React rather than by reading it. `AssignReactiveScopes` uses a guarded
// adopt-or-minimise because zero is the unset sentinel. `MergeOverlappingReactiveScopes` uses a plain
// min/max, safe only because `collectScopeInfo` refuses a scope whose start equals its end.
//
// This pass uses a plain `Math.min`/`Math.max` with NO guard anywhere, and there is no upstream
// filter standing in front of it either. Running the arithmetic out of the bundle:
//
//	[7,15) inside a construct terminating at 5   ->  [5,15)   start genuinely MINIMISED
//	[3,15) inside the same construct             ->  [3,15)   already earlier, unchanged
//	[0,15) unset start                           ->  [0,15)   stays zero
//	[0,0)  fully unset                           ->  [0,0)    stays unset
//
// So a zero start is not poisoned by this pass, and the reason is structural rather than a guard:
// the operation is `min(start, constructStart)` and a construct start is always non-zero, so zero is
// ABSORBING here rather than poisoning. That is the opposite direction from the hull in
// `AssignReactiveScopes`, where the danger was a zero dragging a real start down. A fully unset scope
// never becomes active at all, because activity is `scope.range.end > startingId` and an end of zero
// fails that for every block. `TestAlignMinimisesWithoutAGuard` pins all four rows.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: `placeScopes` is written and never read, so it is not reproduced
//
// `recordPlace` populates a `placeScopes` map keyed on the PLACE OBJECT (bundle lines 43262-43265).
// Nothing in this function ever reads it; the only reader of a map by that name is
// `mergeOverlappingReactiveScopesHIR`'s own separate one at line 32487. `Place` is a value type in
// this package and has no object identity to key on, so reproducing it would have required a
// side table that exists to be written and never read. Omitted deliberately rather than overlooked.
//
// # Termination is a single sweep, and the bound is structural rather than empirical
//
// One pass over the blocks in the order `Function.Blocks` already holds, visiting each instruction
// once and each terminal once. `activeBlockFallthroughRanges` is a stack that is pushed at most once
// per terminal carrying a fallthrough and popped only when the sweep ENTERS the matching fallthrough
// block, which happens at most once per block, so its total churn is bounded by the block count.
// `activeScopes` is a set filtered at each block boundary and added to only from places the sweep is
// already visiting. Nothing revisits anything and there is no fixpoint, so the structure forbids
// iteration rather than converging. `TestAlignIsASingleSweep` pins the visit count.
//
// Like the merge, the sweep rests on evaluation order being monotone along the block sequence, which
// is an assumption about what `Construct` produces rather than about this file.
// `TestMergeAssumesMonotoneEvaluationOrder` already pins that at 0 non-monotone steps, and this pass
// inherits it rather than re-measuring the same table.
//
// The visit count is measured against the blocks of functions that HAVE scopes rather than against
// every block, because a function with no scope returns before the sweep begins: 49 of 677 corpus
// functions, carrying 217 blocks. Getting that denominator wrong is how `TestAlignIsASingleSweep`
// first failed, on a pass that was already correct.
//
// # Determinism, which a Go map would otherwise destroy
//
// Upstream's `activeScopes` is a `Set` iterated in insertion order and its widening writes through
// aliased range objects, so upstream is deterministic without trying. `activeScopes` here records
// insertion order explicitly and every widening is applied through that ordered slice, so two scopes
// widened at one block boundary are written in the same sequence on every run. The writes are
// commutative min/max so the order cannot change the answer, but recording it keeps a future
// non-commutative addition from being a silent nondeterminism. `TestAlignIsDeterministic` runs the
// pass twice over the corpus and compares.
