// TestMergeLeavesTheGraphResolvable pins that no reference outlives the block it names.
//
// A merged-away block is deleted from the id index, so every terminal that named it and every
// fallthrough that pointed at it has to be repointed. A missed one is not a crash: `Block` returns
// false and passes skip the edge, so the function analyses as though the edge were absent.
//
// # This runs on the SINGLE-return fixture, and the reason is a measurement
//
// It was written first against the multi-return one, on the assumption that a bigger graph is a
// better test. Measured, that fixture merges NOTHING, and correctly so: the labeled form's cut
// block ends in a `Label` rather than a `Goto`, the label's target is a fallthrough-protected
// block, and the continuation has two predecessors because both returns jump to it. All three of
// upstream's conditions decline it, which is the pass working rather than failing.
//
// So the merge only has something to do on the single-return path -- and that is also the path
// where it matters, because that is the one that gives straight-line code block boundaries it did
// not have.
//
// The CALLER branches, which is the second thing this fixture needs. A caller that does not branch
// merges all the way down to one block ending in a `Return`, and a `Return` names no block -- so
// the repointing this test is about has nothing left to check and the vacuity guard at the bottom
// fires. The branch leaves real references behind for the merge to get wrong.

// unconditionally on the one path that absorbed them. The graph still builds.
//
// # BOTH arms are spliced, and getting to that fixture took two measurements
//
// Written first against a plain `if`/`else`, this could not see the mutation that removes the
// single-predecessor condition. Measured: that fixture merges NOTHING either way, because the
// join's predecessors are the two arms and each arm's own predecessor is the `If` block -- the pass
// declines on "the predecessor must end in a `Goto`" long before it reaches the count, so the
// mutant's extra merges never happen.
//
// Splicing into ONE arm was the second attempt and it also survived, for a subtler version of the
// same reason: the join's predecessors are then the spliced arm's tail and the `If` block itself,
// and the `If` is still what the `Goto` condition rejects. Measured output was byte-identical with
// and without the mutant.
//
// Splicing into BOTH arms is what discriminates. Every predecessor of the join then ends in a
// `Goto`, so the count is the only condition left standing between the pass and swallowing the
// join -- which is the point: a guard is only tested by an input where it is the guard that
