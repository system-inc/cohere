// The name an outlined function takes must resolve back to that function.
//
// This is the invariant the `Outlined` map cannot hold on its own. That map is keyed by the
// identifier the `LoadGlobal` was written into, and a second `Construct` renumbers every identifier
// in the function -- which inlining an immediately invoked function expression forces. The key then
// names a value that no longer exists while the map still reports a hit for the old one, so the
// lookup fails silently and a callback resolver finds nothing.
//
// Measured on `error.validate-object-values-mutation`: with the map alone and the memo callback
// inlined, `values.map(cb)` stopped resolving `cb`, so it emitted no mutation for the element it is
// called over, `object`'s mutable range collapsed from `{3,20}` to `{3,4}`, and the scope no longer
// spanned the mutation the golden is about. Two goldens turned silent for that reason alone.
//
// The name is the durable half: it is synthesized from the function id, nothing rewrites it, and it
// survives renumbering. Pinning the round trip here keeps the two halves from drifting apart.
