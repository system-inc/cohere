// TestReactiveVisitorReachesEveryInstruction is the conservation property, applied to the walk.
//
// `BuildReactiveFunction` already asserts that instructions entering the graph arrive in the tree.
// This asserts the second half nobody had: that a walk over the tree reaches them. A visitor that
// silently skips a terminal's block would leave every consuming pass blind on that construct, and
// the tree itself would still look correct -- which is precisely the failure a shape assertion
// cannot see and a count can.
//
// # The denominator is not `result.Instructions`, and the difference is real rather than a fudge
//
// `measureValue` counts a bare `ReactiveInstructionValue` sitting in a terminal's value position as
// one instruction -- a single-instruction value block that `valueOf` collapsed rather than wrapping
// in a one-element sequence. There is no `ReactiveInstruction` node there for a walk to hand to an
// `Instruction` hook, so a hook-based count is legitimately lower.
//
// The first spelling of this test used `result.Instructions` as the denominator and failed at 10 of
// 12 on the for-of case, which is exactly the residue `eachTerminalValue`'s comment already
// describes. That was the test being wrong about the tree, not the walk being wrong about the tree.
// The property that actually matters is stated instead: every `ReactiveInstruction` NODE in the
// tree is reached, counted by an independent walk rather than by the builder.
