// The relationship between a memo block's markers and the scopes that carry its dependencies,
// counted across the whole corpus.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// `preserve-manual-memoization` compares what the compiler inferred as a scope's dependencies
// against what the developer wrote in the memo block enclosing it. That comparison can only run on a
// scope the walk reaches while the block is still open. A scope carrying dependencies that closes
// OUTSIDE the marker pair is invisible to the rule no matter how correct the comparison is.
//
// Tracing one fixture by hand says whether that happened once. It cannot say whether the shape is
// the common case or an idiosyncrasy of three fixtures, and that distinction decides whether the
// scope boundary is a systematic defect worth its own repair or a curiosity. This counts it.
//
// # What it measures, and why the counts are shaped this way
//
// The walk here reproduces `manualMemoValidator.walk` exactly: same descent, same marker pairing by
// `ManualMemoId`, same "a scope is inside the block if the walk is between its markers when the
// scope CLOSES" rule. It has to, because the number is only meaningful as a statement about what
// the validator can see. A structurally similar walk that differed in when it considers a scope
// closed would produce a number about nothing.
//
// Four populations, per memo block:
//
//	scopesInside          scopes closing between the markers
//	carryingInside        those with at least one inferred dependency  <- the rule can compare these
//	emptyInside           those with none                              <- reachable but nothing to say
//	carryingOutsideAfter  dependency-carrying scopes closing after `FinishMemoize`
//
// `carryingOutsideAfter` is deliberately NOT a defect count on its own, which took a wrong draft to
// learn. The JSX consuming a memoized value legitimately closes after the block and legitimately
// depends on it: `<button onClick={onClick} />` is a scope carrying `onClick`, outside the block,
// and correct. Counting those as misplaced reported 3 of 4 fixtures broken when none of them were.
//
// So the readable signal is `emptyInside` against `carryingInside`. A memo block whose interior
// scopes all carry nothing is a block the rule cannot fire on for any reason at all.

	// Measured floors. `blocksWithCarrying` is the population the rule's third condition can fire

	// must not rise.
	//
	// Both are pinned rather than logged because the asymmetry that nearly shipped a regression as
	// an improvement in the score test applies here identically: a change that empties more blocks
	// while emptying fewer elsewhere would read as neutral on a single total.
	// # Moved when React's stable built-ins stopped being dependencies
	//
	// 74 carrying to 69, 15 all-empty to 20. Five memo blocks became empty because the only
	// dependency they carried was a value React guarantees is identity-stable -- a `useTransition`
	// start function, a `useState` setter, a `useOptimistic` setter.
	//
	// An empty block is the RIGHT answer for those, and upstream's own output says so: both
	// `preserve-use-memo-transition.ts` and `preserve-use-callback-stable-built-ins.ts` compile to
	// `if ($[0] === Symbol.for("react.memo_cache_sentinel"))`, which is the marker for a value
	// memoized once with no dependencies at all. Neither expects an error.
	//
	// So this count moving down is not a regression here, and the direction of `blocksWithCarrying`
	// is not always the direction of correctness. The ceiling on `blocksAllEmptyWithCapture` below
	// is what still guards the defect this oracle was built for.
	// Lowered from 69 to 67 by defining a context binding once in SSA rather than versioning every
	// write (see `defineIn` in `ssa.go`). Two blocks lose an interior carrying scope because the
	// declaration and the reassignment now share one class rather than forming two, so what was two
	// scopes carrying dependencies is one.
	//
	// The paragraph above is the reason this is not read as a regression: `blocksAllEmpty` holds at
	// 20 and `blocksAllEmptyWithCapture` at 14, which are the counts that guard the defect this
	// oracle exists for. And the change it records fires both
	// `error.invalid-useCallback-captures-reassigned-context` fixtures, which is the third
	// condition reaching programs it could not reach before rather than fewer.
	// # Lowered again when a callback's mutation began widening the receiver's range
	//
	// 67 to 66, and the block that stops carrying is named rather than assumed: logging the fixture
	// per carrying block and diffing the two configurations gives exactly
	// `error.validate-object-values-mutation`, with nothing gained.
	//
	// Upstream carries zero scopes inside that memo block. Read at the same stage, its output is
	// two scopes -- `SCOPE 1 decls=[52]` and `SCOPE 3 decls=[65]` -- with the memo markers sitting
	// INSIDE scope 1 rather than wrapping a scope of their own, so there is no scope between them
	// to carry anything. Our widening produces that same shape.
	//
	// So this is the third lowering for the reason the paragraph above already records twice: the
	// direction of `blocksWithCarrying` is not always the direction of correctness. Unlike the
	// earlier two, this one is checked against upstream's own output rather than argued from ours.
	// # Lowered once more, and the block is the sibling of the last one
	//
	// 66 to 65 on exactly `error.validate-object-entries-mutation`, named the same way and with
	// nothing gained. It differs from `error.validate-object-values-mutation` only in destructuring
	// its callback parameter, and upstream's output for it has the same shape: two scopes,
	// `SCOPE 1 decls=[54]` and `SCOPE 3 decls=[69]`, with the memo markers inside scope 1 rather
	// than wrapping one, so there is no scope between them to carry anything.

	// the callback and the symmetry was worth checking.

	// counts blocks where upstream emits a cache slot and we carry nothing. The added fixture is
