// Scoring our reactive scope structure against upstream's own compiled output.
//
// The second oracle in this tree, after `dependency_oracle_test.go`. That one asks whether a scope
// depends on the right values; this one asks whether the scopes exist at all, and how many.
//
// # Why the answer key is trustworthy
//
// Upstream's `## Code` block is what React's compiler actually emitted for the fixture, and a
// surviving reactive scope appears in it as exactly one cache guard:
//
//	const $ = _c(7);
//	if ($[0] !== propA || $[1] !== t1) {   <- one surviving scope
//
// So counting `if ($[n] !== ` over that block counts upstream's scopes directly. No inference, no
// reconstruction: it is their compiler's own answer, checked into their repository.
//
// # The stage question, which had to be settled before any number here meant anything
//
// Our pipeline holds two different scope populations, and upstream's guards correspond to only one
// of them. Scopes are ASSIGNED by `AssignReactiveScopes`, then a chain of prune passes dissolves
// the ones that turn out not to be worth memoizing. Upstream's output is emitted after their
// equivalent chain, so their guards are the SURVIVORS.
//
// Measured both ways over the same fixtures, one pipeline run counted twice:
//
//	upstream guards                          97
//	assigned   total 160   33 over,  4 under, 11 exact
//	survived   total 114   18 over,  5 under, 25 exact
//
// The totals alone do not settle it -- 114 is closer to 97 than 160 is, but a stage could get the
// aggregate right while being wrong on every individual fixture. The per-fixture agreement is what
// settles it: EXACT more than doubles, 11 of 48 to 25 of 48. A stage that merely netted out would
// leave that flat. So this oracle scores the survived population, and the assigned count is
// reported alongside it as context rather than pinned.
//
// This mattered more than a detail. Read at the assigned stage the gap is 1.65x and looks like a
// systematic fusion defect; read at the correct stage it is 1.18x. Three sessions of theory were
// built on the wrong stage of our own pipeline before anyone counted both.
//
// # Three numbers, because one would have lied
//
// At the survived stage the total improved AND per-fixture agreement doubled AND `under` got worse
// (4 fixtures to 5). A single-number oracle reports that as an unambiguous win. It is not: `under`
// is the correctness direction. An extra scope memoizes something upstream did not, which costs
// performance; a MISSING scope drops a memoization the developer wrote, which changes behaviour.
// Two of the five are our prune chain dissolving scopes upstream keeps.
//
// So `under` is pinned as a ceiling that fails loudly, and it is the number that outranks the other
// two whenever they disagree.
