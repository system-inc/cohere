// TestOptionalLoadsProveNothingAboutTheirObject pins that `a?.b` does not make `a` hoistable.
//
// An optional load is the guard AGAINST its object being null, so reading it is not evidence the
// object is non-null -- it is evidence the program expects it might be. Recording it as non-null
// makes the dependency tree's cursor non-null at that step, which takes the
// `hoistableCursor.nonNull` arm in `addDependency` and flattens `arg?.items` to `arg.items`. The
// comparison then reports an optionality mismatch against a source that wrote `arg?.items`, which is
// a disagreement the analysis manufactured.
//
// # Why this is read from a flag rather than ported
//
// Upstream keys its hoistable set by optional BLOCK: `collectOptionalChainSidemap` builds
// `optionalBlock -> baseObject?.a` (`CollectHoistablePropertyLoads.ts:94`), so the guard survives
// into the tree and the optional arm fires. That pass is 418 lines and is driven by `Optional`
// TERMINALS. This lowering does not produce them -- measured on the fixture below, the only
// terminals are `Return` -- so the same fact is read from `PropertyLoad.Optional`, which upstream
// does not have because its optionality lives in control flow.
//
// The two halves are atomic. Measured, neither alone moves anything: the hoistable change without
// the flag reaching the tree is inert, and the flag without this change is flattened at the arm.
