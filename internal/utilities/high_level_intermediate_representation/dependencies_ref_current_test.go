// TestRefCurrentReadsTruncateToTheirRoot pins that `.current` is not a dependency.
//
// Upstream's `visitDependency` truncates such a path to empty with the comment "ref.current access
// is not a valid dep" (`PropagateScopeDependenciesHIR.ts:536`). A scope must depend on the ref
// OBJECT rather than on the mutable slot inside it: `ref.current` changes without the ref changing,
// so a dependency naming it would claim a stability React does not offer.
//
// # This diverges from upstream and the divergence is deliberate
//
// Upstream's guard is `isUseRefType(identifier) && path[0].property === 'current'`. The type half is
// not expressible here -- `Identifier.Type` is nil throughout this IR, which is what
// `DependencyGapTypeExclusions` records -- so only the property name is tested.
//
// The cost is that a value named `current` on a non-ref object is truncated where upstream keeps the
// path. That is the safe direction: the scope then depends on the whole object and invalidates more
// often than needed, never less. Measured corpus-wide it moves five dependencies from carrying a
// path to carrying none, and the dependency oracle is unchanged at 78 matched of 88, so none of the
// five was an answer upstream names.
//
// The fixture below is upstream's own `repro-maybe-invalid-useCallback-read-maybeRef.ts`, whose
// parameter is deliberately untyped -- "maybe" a ref. Upstream compiles it with no error and a bare
// `maybeRef` dependency; before this, our nested-function walk produced `maybeRef.current` and the
// comparison reported a `RefAccessDifference` against the source's `[maybeRef]`.
