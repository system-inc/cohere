// branchingParentSource is the fixture both copy tests lower.
//
// Two properties are load-bearing and neither is incidental. The nested body branches, so it holds
// more than one block and its terminals name blocks -- a single-block body has no reference a
// skipped remap could leave stale. And the PARENT branches before it ever reaches the call, which
// pushes the parent's own block ids past the low numbers a freshly lowered nested body starts at.
// Measured: with a straight-line parent, the two id spaces coincided exactly, so a mutation that
// skipped the block remap left ids that were still inside the copied set and the test passed. The
// spread is what gives the assertion something to see.
