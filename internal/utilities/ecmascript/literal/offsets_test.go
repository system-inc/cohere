// TestLineContinuationIsRefused is the live defect this function's history records.

// offset past the run was wrong. Found by the second caller probing this against its own corpus
// before building on it, which is the argument for the function having a home of its own.

// TestDisagreementIsRefused covers the honest-failure path. A cooked value the walk cannot reconcile
