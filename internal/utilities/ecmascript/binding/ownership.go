// Package binding answers whether an identifier names something this file chose.
//
// Every rule that judges an identifier's spelling has to ask this before it reports, because
// renaming a name somebody else chose changes what the code reaches for rather than what it calls
// something. A census found two implementations in one package, one word apart in their names and
// four kinds apart in their answers, neither able to see the other.

// IsForeignName reports whether an identifier names something this file did not choose, so a rule

//
// # The positions, and what each one is
//
//	thing.name          the property half of a read; the name belongs to whatever `thing` is
//	{ name: 1 }         an object-literal key, which shapes a value somebody else consumes
//	import { name }     an imported binding, in all four of its spellings
//	interface { name }  a property signature, which is very often an external wire surface
//	A.name              the right half of a qualified name, which is the other module's spelling
//	name in a type      a type reference, naming a type this file may not own
//	<name />, name=     a JSX tag or attribute
//
// # A property read off `this` is deliberately NOT foreign
//
// The property belongs to the class being read, which this file owns, and its declaration is a
// property declaration that no member check protects. Treating it like any other property read is
// how a class ended up declaring `maximumBackoff` while reading `this.maximumBackoff`, measured in
// the abbreviation rule that carries this exemption today.
//
// The sibling ambiguous-identifier rule exempted it, and that was the one place the two lifted
// implementations genuinely disagreed rather than merely differing in coverage.
//
// **Decided once, by Kirk, rather than left to two files that could not see each other.** The
// reasoning is about ownership rather than about syntax: `document.cookie` is foreign because nobody
// here owns `document`, while `this.e` is a name we chose, on an object we own, in a file we
// control. Renaming it is a rename, not a reach for somebody else's API, so exempting it would mean
// a naming rule cannot see the names we actually control. The `BackoffTask` receipt is the evidence
// rather than the argument: a class declared `maximumBackoff` while reading `this.maximumBackoff`,
// and the rule was blind to it.
//
// The consequence is intended rather than tolerated: `consistency-no-ambiguous-identifier` reports
// `this.e` and its one-letter siblings now, where it did not before.
//
// A later reader who finds this surprising should not helpfully re-add the carve-out. The question
// was asked and answered; re-adding it re-opens a disagreement that cost two rules their agreement
// for as long as neither could see the other.
//
// # JSX has no exemption upstream and needs one here
//
// The ESTree originals never wrote a JSX case, because their parser gives a JSX name its own node
// type and it never reaches an identifier visitor. In typescript-go a JSX tag and a JSX attribute
// are plain `KindIdentifier` nodes, so reproducing only the written-down exemptions cost 3,081 false
// findings on a real tree. That is the general shape of this class of divergence: an exemption the
// original gets free from its AST has to be written down in ours.
