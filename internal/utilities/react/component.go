// Package react answers the questions a rule asks about React code that are not questions about
// JSX: is this call constructing an element, is this a component, which component encloses this.
//
// It is a sibling of `internal/utilities/jsx/` rather than part of it, because none of these touch a
// JSX node. `createElement` is an ordinary call expression and a class component is an ordinary
// class; a rule can ask both about a file with no JSX in it at all.
//
// Built on measured demand rather than on one caller's word. In oxc's own react rules,
// `is_create_element_call` has nine callers and the component predicates have twelve, and oxc
// factored both into `utils/react.rs` for the same reason this package exists. Two independent
// research passes on `#rulesreact` reached the component predicate from the rule sources without
// any brief mentioning it, which is what separates a real shared surface from a guess about one.

// `Preact.createElement(...)`. Requiring the React namespace would silence the rule on every
// codebase that imports the function directly, which is the common modern spelling.
//
// **`document.createElement` is rejected by name.** It is the one call that shares the property
// name and constructs a DOM node rather than a React element, and upstream special-cases it
// exactly this way.
//
// **A computed member counts.** `React['createElement'](...)` is the same call written differently,
// and a check that read only static members would miss it while looking complete.
//
// **Not every upstream rule asks this question the same way, so check before reaching for this.**
// oxc has one shared `is_create_element_call` and also rules that test the callee themselves, and
// the two disagree in three directions at once. `no_danger_with_children.rs:76` destructures a
// `StaticMemberExpression` and returns early otherwise, so it never sees a bare `createElement(...)`,
// does not reject `document.`, and does not accept a computed member.
//
// A port of that rule calling this helper starts reporting where upstream is silent, and its own
// corpus cannot catch the difference because none of its fixtures writes a bare call. Verified at
// both sources rather than inferred, after `@system_verify_format` found it while researching the
// react ports.
