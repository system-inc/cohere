// The CSS value parser: a small recursive-descent pass that turns a value string into a node tree
// of words, functions, and separators.
//
// Ported from `src/value-parser.ts` at the v4.3.3 tag, read at the tag rather than from the
// minified bundle, so a disagreement with the engine is a finding rather than version skew.
//
// # What this is for
//
// `segment.go` already carries a value splitter, and the two are not redundant. `segment` answers
// one question — where are the top-level separators — and answers it over a flat string, which is
// all `inferDataType` needs. This answers the structural question: what is the tree. The `@utility`
// evaluator needs the tree to read a `--value(--percentage-*, [*])` argument list, where the
// arguments are nodes rather than substrings, and callers downstream depend on the node shapes
// rather than on the top-level split.
//
// # Whitespace is preserved, exactly
//
// A run of separator characters becomes one separator node holding the run verbatim, so
// `foo(bar,  baz)` keeps its two spaces and reprints identically. This matters more than it looks:
// the parser is used on values that must round-trip, and a parser that normalised `, ` to `,` would
// agree with the engine on structure and disagree on every printed result.
//
// # Deliberate fidelity to JavaScript semantics
//
// Three behaviors here are consequences of how the upstream loop is written rather than of stated
// intent. They are ported deliberately, are pinned by fixtures measured against the shipped engine,
// and each is called out at its branch below:
//
//   - A pending buffer in front of an unmatched `)` is discarded, because upstream flushes it with
//     `tail?.nodes.push(...)` and `tail` is undefined when the stack is empty. `a)b` parses to a
//     single word `b`, and `foo\(bar)` parses to nothing at all.
//   - A trailing `\` yields the literal text `\undefined`, because upstream concatenates
//     `input[i + 1]`, and indexing one past the end of a JavaScript string is `undefined`, which
//     stringifies rather than throwing.
//   - The final buffer flush always lands at the top level, never inside a function still left
//     open, so `foo(bar` puts `bar` beside the function rather than in it.
//
// A port that "fixed" any of these would be wrong in the direction of a plausible tree, which is
// the failure mode that is expensive to notice.
