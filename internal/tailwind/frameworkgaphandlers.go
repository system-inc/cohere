// The ported `handle` bodies of the framework roots whose reading partitions on the value.
//
// The third and last slice of the emitter port. frameworkhandlers.go covers the 33 roots that emit
// one declaration and frameworkmultihandlers.go the 152 that emit a fixed list; both answer a root
// with a single declaration list, because for those roots there is only one.
//
// These 57 are the roots where that is false. `border-[3px]` is a width and `border-red-500` is a
// colour, `text-[3px]` is a font size and `text-red-500` is a colour, and the two emit different
// properties from the same registration. So an emitter here is a function of the value rather than a
// list stored under a root, which is the shape upstream's own handle bodies have: every one of these
// opens with a `switch` on an inferred type, or a fallthrough between a colour lookup and a width
// lookup, and returns a different array per arm.
//
// Same contract as the other two files otherwise. Each body was read at the v4.3.3 tag, the `decl`
// shape is ported and the value expression is not, and the reading is `PropertySort` over what an
// emitter produced rather than a number stored beside it.
//
// # What a branch needs, and why it is not `ResolvedUtilityValue`
//
// The other two slices take a `ResolvedUtilityValue`, because a root with one declaration list does
// not read it. These do, and measured against the descriptor rows they read four things, not one:
//
//   - whether the class carried a value at all. `border` is a width and `border-red-500` is a
//     colour, and upstream's first line is `if (!candidate.value)`.
//   - whether that value was arbitrary or named. `scale-[2]` emits one declaration and `scale-150`
//     emits four, and no inferred type separates them: upstream's arbitrary arm returns early.
//   - the inferred data type, against the root's own ordered type list. This is the branch the
//     milestone named, and it is the one `InferDataType` already answers.
//   - whether a modifier was written. `text-[3px]` emits `font-size` alone and `text-[3px]/50`
//     emits `font-size` and `line-height`; `shadow-md` writes `--tw-shadow-alpha` with an absent
//     value and `shadow-md/50` writes it with a real one, and `PropertySort` skips an absent value
//     and counts a present one. That is the whole of the `#2` against `#3` difference on the
//     shadow family's own axis, and it is a fact about the candidate rather than about the value.
//
// `ResolvedUtilityValue` carries the first three between `Value`, `DataType` and `IsStaticValue`,
// and carries nothing at all about the fourth: resolution consumes the modifier and does not report
// it. So the emitter takes a `UtilityBranch` instead, which names all four, and
// `UtilityBranchFor` builds one from the pieces a caller already has. Passing the resolved value
// alone would make the shadow family unportable rather than merely awkward, and would do it
// silently, since every arm would still return a well-formed list.
//
// # Where the descriptor rows say something upstream's source does not
//
// A descriptor row is keyed on a theme namespace as well as on a type, and the two are not the same
// question. `border-red-500` resolves through `--color` and `border-4` through `--border-width`, and
// neither is an inferred type: `red-500` infers as nothing and `4` infers as an integer on a root
// whose type list does not branch on integers.
//
// Upstream that distinction is a fallthrough rather than a switch. The colour lookup runs first and
// returns if it hit, the width lookup runs second. So a named value is a colour when the theme says
// so and a width otherwise, and the emitter takes that as an input (`ResolvedAsColor`) rather than
// re-deriving it, because deriving it would mean carrying every repository's `--color` keys into a
// file that describes Tailwind. That is the same seam descriptor_base_table.go draws, for the same
// reason.
