// Package tailwind decides which class names could possibly collapse, so that almost none of them
// have to be asked about.
//
// Tailwind's collapse logic — the thing that knows `px-4 py-4` is `p-4` and `w-8 h-8` is `size-8` —
// is a signature-equivalence search sitting on the whole Tailwind compiler. It is JavaScript, it is
// eight to ten thousand lines, and it changes every Tailwind minor. verify is Go. That boundary is
// the one place in this tool where the answer is not "delete the boundary."
//
// This package is the part that does not have to cross it. Two classes can only merge when
// everything except their root already agrees: their variants, their importance, and their value.
// `px-4 py-4` becomes `p-4`, but `px-4 py-2` collapses to nothing and so does `px-4 sm:py-4`. So
// classes are bucketed by everything-but-the-root, and only classes landing in the same bucket are
// worth a real answer.
//
// Measured on the ahra corpus of 2,682 distinct className literals, that takes the number of
// literals needing an engine answer from 2,682 to a handful, and the number of class pairs from
// 4,375 to the few that share a bucket. Whatever the answer to the boundary question turns out to
// be, asking it two orders of magnitude less often changes the arithmetic underneath every option.
//
// # The direction of error is not symmetric
//
// An over-approximation costs an engine call. An under-approximation loses a finding, silently, on
// a tree that looks clean because the rule stopped looking. Three separate attempts at a cheaper
// gate each lost real findings during the oxlint migration and each measured faster:
//
//   - Splitting the class on dashes to find its root reads `border-l` as root `border` with value
//     `l`, buckets it away from `border-r`, and stops reporting `border-x`.
//   - Giving every static utility its own bucket separates `overflow-x-hidden` from
//     `overflow-y-hidden` and stops reporting `overflow-hidden`.
//   - Requiring two classes to declare the same CSS property family cuts engine calls by an order
//     of magnitude and stops reporting `w-8 h-8` into `size-8`, because a shorthand can absorb
//     properties that share no name — `width` and `height` become `size`, `column-gap` and
//     `row-gap` become `gap`.
//
// Every one was caught by a fixture and none by review. So this package errs toward asking, always,
// and its tests assert the collapses it must not lose rather than the speed it achieves.
