// What a framework class declares, computed from its handle body rather than read from a table.
//
// This is the consumer-facing half of the emitter port. frameworkhandlers.go, frameworkmultihandlers.go
// and frameworkgaphandlers.go each hold one slice of the ported `handle` bodies; this file is the one
// entry point that dispatches across all three and answers the question `no-conflicting-classes`
// actually asks, which is not a reading but a list of CSS property names.
//
// # Why a reading was never the right source for this, and a declaration list is
//
// conflict_facts.go's own file comment worked through this and reached the right conclusion for the
// tools it had. `Table.Lookup` returns `Order`, indices into `PropertyOrder`, and inverting those to
// property names gets 1,355 of 1,530 corpus classes right and 75 wrong. The three ways it fails are
// all the same failure: a reading is a lossy projection of a declaration list.
//
//   - A `--tw-sort` override replaces the reading outright. `divide-y` reads `divide-y-width`, which
//     is not a CSS property at all, while the class emits four real ones.
//   - A property outside `PropertyOrder` contributes no position. `backdrop-blur-sm` declares
//     `-webkit-backdrop-filter` and `backdrop-filter`; only one is invertible.
//   - Two declarations can share a position, so a count cannot be recovered from an order.
//
// Every one of those is a fact the declaration list has and the reading has thrown away. So this file
// asks the emitters for the list itself and never goes near a reading, which is why it does not
// inherit any of the 75.
//
// # Custom properties are stripped here, and that is a different question from the ordering tables
//
// The ordering tables keep `--tw-*` custom properties because they are what separates `shadow-lg`
// from `ring-1` in the sort. This strips them, because two classes both setting `--tw-border-style`
// are not in conflict about anything an author sees. That is the same split the deleted conflict
// tables drew, kept rather than rediscovered: `OrderingPropertiesByRoot` and the conflict tables
// answered deliberately different questions from the same handle bodies, and now one emitter answers
// both by being asked differently.
//
// # The negation prefix
//
// Upstream registers `-m` as root `m` with `supportsNegative`, so the emitters are keyed on the
// undashed name. `descriptor.go`'s `frameworkReading` already strips the prefix for the same reason.
// Measured against the deleted table: of its 308 roots, 69 were negative spellings of a root the
// emitters answer, and stripping is what makes those 69 resolvable rather than absent.

// property came out the same both times.
//
// This is upstream's own definition rather than a proxy for it. The generator that produced the
// deleted `ComposingRoots` compiled two values through the real engine and compared declaration
// text, and this is the same comparison with the same inputs.
//
// # The limit, and it is structural rather than a gap to fill later
//
// Only the two value-independent slices can answer this. The 57 value-partitioned roots in
// frameworkgaphandlers.go take a `UtilityBranch`, which carries the value's shape and never the
// value, so two values of a gap root emit identical text whether the root composes or not. Measured:
// 27 of 27 composing gap roots compare identical, and so do 25 of 30 non-composing ones, which is a
