// engine before any handle body was ported, and every root now carries an emitter transcribed from
// `utilities.ts`. The two were produced by different means from different sources, so forcing them
// to agree class for class is a real comparison rather than a table checking itself.
//
// The comparison is on the reading rather than on the property string, because the reading is what
// every consumer of this package actually asks for, and because `PropertySort` is where a wrong
// property name stops being a typo and starts being a wrong sort key. A property absent from
// `PropertyOrder` contributes no position, so two different unknown properties would compare equal
// as strings and equal as readings alike; TestEmittedPropertyNamesAreTheMeasuredOnes is what covers
// those six roots.
