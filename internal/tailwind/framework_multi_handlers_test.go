// engine, and every root now carries an emitter transcribed from `utilities.ts` or, for five of
// them, from `compat/legacy-utilities.ts`. The two were produced by different means from different
// sources, so `PropertySort(Emit(root, value))` against the stored reading is a real comparison.
//
// It is a stronger comparison than the 33-root one, because a reading here carries a count that
// exceeds its order length on 30 roots and a latched order on six. An emitter that dropped a
// declaration, emitted one too many, or lost a `--tw-sort` changes the count or the order and fails
// here, where a property-name comparison would see nothing.
