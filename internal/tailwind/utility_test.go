// registry half is the one Phase 0 measured, so the 18 known exceptions are covered exactly as they
// were reported. The sweep half reaches what `getClassList()` does not advertise and what the
// registry therefore cannot test: fractions, which drive the ratio splice; decimals, where `1.25`
// survives and `1.3` drops on the same declaration; arbitrary values with and without a typehint;
// and modifier forms, which are what the four post-conditions gate.
//
// The `@utility` blocks are carried as CSS text rather than as a pre-parsed tree, and the Go side
// parses them with cssparser.go. That composes the two components the way production will compose
// them: a fixture holding a tree the Go parser might never produce would test this evaluator
// against an input it never sees.
