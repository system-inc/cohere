// The framework's static utility registrations, and the reading a static body produces.
//
// A static utility takes no value: `flex` is `display: flex` and `sr-only` is nine declarations, and
// neither consults the theme. So its reading is a constant, and the constant is PropertySort over
// the declarations it compiles to. This file holds the declaration type the generated table emits
// and the lookup that turns a body into a reading.
//
// # Why the table carries declarations rather than readings
//
// The base descriptor table carries `{order, count}` per static, which is the answer rather than the
// input. Carrying declarations instead means the reading is computed by the same PropertySort walk
// that answers a repository's own `@utility` blocks in descriptor_live.go, so the framework path and
// the repository path cannot drift apart about what a declaration list means. A table of readings
// can disagree with the walk; a table of declarations feeding the walk cannot.
//
// It also makes a wrong entry loud rather than plausible. A transposed reading is a number that
// still sorts; a transposed property name is visible against the engine's own compiled tree, which
// is what `tools/gen_tailwind_statics/enumerate.mjs` captures.
package tailwind

// StaticDeclaration is one declaration of a static utility's compiled body.
//
// The fields mirror the declaration kind in ast.go rather than a reduced form, because PropertySort
// reads all of them: ValuePresent decides whether a declaration is counted at all, since upstream
// skips one whose value is `undefined` and counts one whose value is the empty string.

// together or fails both together, and neither can quietly keep an old answer.
