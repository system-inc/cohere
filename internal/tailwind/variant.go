// Variant ordering: the position a variant holds in Tailwind's sort, and the bitmask the class
// comparator's first dimension is built from.
//
// Ported from `src/variants.ts` and the sort in `src/compile.ts` at Tailwind 4.3.3, read at the
// pinned tag rather than from the minified bundle, so a disagreement is a finding rather than
// version skew.
//
// # What was deliberately not ported, and why
//
// Almost all of it. `variants.ts` is 1,317 lines and roughly 1,000 of them build CSS: the `applyFn`
// of every registered variant, which rewrites a rule into a `@media` wrapper or a `:hover`
// selector, plus `substituteAtSlot`, `substituteAtVariant` and the selector machinery around them.
// verify emits no CSS. What it needs from this file is the variant's sort position and nothing
// downstream of it, so the `applyFn` bodies are absent rather than stubbed. A stub would read as
// supported.
//
// Also absent: `suggest` and `getCompletions`, which exist for IntelliSense; `compoundsWith` and
// `compoundsForSelectors`, which the candidate parser owns in candidate.go and which this file
// consumes through the registry rather than reimplementing.
//
// # The position is not a property of the variant
//
// This is the finding that decides the component, and it is the opposite of what the source
// suggests. Reading `variants.ts` shows every registered variant holding an `order` number, which
// invites a static table of variant to position. verify has shipped exactly that table, 145
// entries, generated once.
//
// `getVariantOrder` in `design-system.ts` does not read those numbers out to consumers. It sorts
// the variants that were *actually parsed during this run*, then assigns them dense indices from
// zero, and collapses ties onto a shared index:
//
//	for (let variant of variants) {
//	  if (prevVariant !== undefined && this.variants.compare(prevVariant, variant) !== 0) index++
//	  order.set(variant, index)
//	}
//
// So `hover` is index 0 in a run that parsed `hover` and `focus`, and index 1 in a run that also
// parsed `group-hover`. The registration numbers survive only as the comparison key inside
// `compare`; the index a consumer sees is a rank within one run's population. A static table cannot
// express that, and one built from a default build agrees with the engine on any corpus whose
// variant set happens to match it and diverges silently on every other. That is why this file
// names its own type RunVariantOrder and builds one per class list, rather than exporting a
// package-level map. The generated `VariantOrder` table in property_order_table.go is the shape
// this component argues against, and the two names sitting in one package is deliberate: the
// difference between them is the finding.
//
// # Registration order is a partial order, not a total one
//
// `Variants.group` assigns every variant registered inside it the *same* order number and may
// attach a comparison function to that number. In a default build `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl` and
// `min` all hold order 64, and four order numbers (63, 64, 65, 66) carry comparison functions.
// The five breakpoints therefore do not order each other by registration at all: they order by
// their resolved `--breakpoint` values, through the theme. A port that gave each breakpoint its own
// position agrees on a default theme and diverges on any repository that redefines one, which is
// the same per-repository defect this whole port exists to remove.
//
// # A `@custom-variant` that reuses a framework name does not move
//
// `Variants.set` does `Object.assign(existing, { kind, applyFn, compounds })` when the name is
// already registered, and never assigns `order`. So `@custom-variant dark (...)` replaces the
// selector `dark:` produces while leaving its sort position exactly where the framework put it.
// Both repositories in this component's corpus do precisely that, and their variant registries are
// byte-identical to the framework's despite emitting a completely different `dark:` selector. Only
// a `@custom-variant` under a *new* name appends a position, past the framework's last.
