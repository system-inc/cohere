// Building a Theme from a repository's stylesheets: `@import` resolution and `@theme` ingestion.
//
// Ported from the `@theme` and `@import` handling in `src/index.ts` and `src/at-import.ts` at
// Tailwind 4.3.3, read at the pinned tag rather than from the minified bundle.
//
// # Where the boundary of this file is, and why it is here rather than further out
//
// `theme.go` is the store. It answers lookups and knows nothing about CSS. This file is the only
// thing that fills it, and it exists because a Theme that cannot be built from a repository proves
// nothing: the exit criterion for this component is a resolved namespace map diffed against the
// engine's own, on two repositories, and there is no way to reach that without walking the real
// `@import` graph.
//
// It is deliberately narrower than upstream's `index.ts`, which is 867 lines because it also builds
// utilities, variants, and the compiled output. What is here is the path from a stylesheet on disk
// to a filled Theme, and nothing else. The pieces that belong to sibling tasks are named in
// "Not handled" below rather than stubbed, so a reader can see the edge of this component instead
// of discovering it.
//
// # Not handled, and what each would take
//
//   - `@import` modifiers other than a bare specifier: `theme(...)`, `prefix(...)`, `reference`,
//     `layer(...)`, `supports(...)`, and media-query conditions. Upstream turns each into a wrapper
//     at-rule around the imported tree. `source(none)`, which both corpus repositories use, is
//     accepted and ignored because it selects content files rather than affecting the theme. Any
//     other modifier is an error rather than a silent drop; see resolveImports.
//   - `@config` and `@plugin`. Both load JavaScript, and verify runs none at lint time. A
//     JavaScript config that defined theme values would land in the theme upstream and not here,
//     which is a real gap and is why loadStylesheetTheme returns the directive it skipped rather
//     than swallowing it.
//   - `@utility`, `@custom-variant`, `@variant`, `@apply`, `@tailwind`. These are sibling tasks
//     (#4f04x54, #1cahbv8) and none of them contributes a theme entry.
//   - Keyframes collected from inside `@theme`. See the note in theme.go: verify emits no CSS.
