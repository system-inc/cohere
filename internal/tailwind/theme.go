// Theme resolution: the store that turns a repository's `@theme` blocks into the namespace lookup
// every utility consults.
//
// Ported from `src/theme.ts` at Tailwind 4.3.3, read at the pinned tag rather than from the
// minified bundle, so a disagreement is a finding rather than version skew.
//
// # Why this component carries the argument for the whole port
//
// The generated tables verify shipped before this were per-repository, not per-Tailwind-release:
// running the generator against two repositories on the same Tailwind 4.3.3 produced tables that
// differed, because each project's own `@theme` entries were baked in as though they were framework
// facts. Measured on the corpus this file is tested against, ahra resolves 744 theme entries and
// www-connected-app resolves 748, on the same engine. This is the code that reads the repository in
// front of us instead of shipping one repository's tokens as everyone's.
//
// # Insertion order is part of the contract, not an implementation detail
//
// Upstream stores entries in a JavaScript `Map`, and three of its methods return values in
// insertion order: `entries`, `keysInNamespaces`, and `namespace`. A Go `map` has no order, and its
// iteration is deliberately randomized per run, so a port backed by a plain map would return a
// different answer on every execution while passing any test that sorted before comparing.
//
// So this stores the order explicitly, in `keyOrder`, alongside the map. Two behaviours of
// `Map.set` are reproduced exactly and both are observable:
//
//   - Overwriting an existing key keeps its original position. `--color-a: red; --color-b: blue;
//     --color-a: green` yields `a, b` with a's value updated, not `b, a`. An append-on-every-write
//     port passes every single-assignment test and reorders every redefinition, which is what a
//     repository's own `@theme` does to the framework defaults it overrides on nearly every key.
//   - Deleting a key and re-adding it puts it at the end, because the position is genuinely gone.
//
// Deleting blanks the key's slot rather than removing it, so a delete stays O(1) amortized. Every
// read skips blank slots, and `compactKeyOrder` reclaims them once the dead outnumber the live,
// which bounds the slice at twice the live size rather than at the total number of writes. Blanking
// rather than tombstoning the key name is load-bearing: a slot still holding its key would be
// indistinguishable from a live one after that key was re-added, and every ordered read would yield
// it twice. No corpus stylesheet deletes and re-adds a key, so the corpus cannot catch that; the
// unit test in theme_test.go is what does.
//
// # What was deliberately not ported, and why
//
// `keyframes` and its two methods. Upstream collects `@keyframes` rules found inside `@theme` so it
// can re-emit them after the `@theme` rule is removed from the output. verify emits no CSS, and the
// reading of a candidate, the `{order, count}` pair the class-order comparator sorts on, never
// consults them. Adding a set that nothing reads would be untested surface that reads as supported.
//
// `src` on each entry, the `SourceLocation` upstream carries so it can build source maps. verify
// reports on the class literal in a user's source file, never on generated CSS.
//
// `markUsedVariable` and `ThemeOptionUsed` are ported, because the bit is observable through
// `GetOptions` and a port that dropped it would silently answer a different bitfield than the
// engine. Nothing in verify calls it yet; see its doc comment.

// reachable for a non-ASCII byte is the `>= 0x80` passthrough, and every byte of a multi-byte UTF-8
// sequence has its high bit set. So a multi-byte character is copied through byte by byte and
// reassembles unchanged, exactly as upstream copies it code unit by code unit.

// a scan: a backslash begins either up to six hex digits with one optional trailing whitespace
// character, or exactly one other character taken literally. A hex escape naming a NUL, a surrogate
// or a value past the Unicode maximum becomes U+FFFD.
//
// The one place bytes and code units genuinely differ is here, because a hex escape can name a
// character outside ASCII, so the decoded code point is written as a rune. The literal branch takes
// one *rune* rather than one byte for the same reason: upstream's `[\S\s]` matches a whole code
// unit, and taking a byte would split a multi-byte character after a backslash. Everything else
// scans bytes, since the hex digits and whitespace terminators are all ASCII.
