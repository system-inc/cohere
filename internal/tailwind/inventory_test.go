// TestEveryTableIsTailwindsOrHasAStatedReason is the inventory this package owes its reader.
//
// The port removed the tables that did not need to exist. What remains splits in two, and the split
// is the whole claim: a table is either Tailwind's own data, which we mirror, or it answers a
// question the port's own machinery structurally cannot, which is stated per table below.
//
// # Tailwind's own data
//
// Upstream carries these and there is no algorithm behind them to port. `property-order.ts` at 4.3.3
// is a hand-written array of 359 property names, with comments in it about how to make `inset-x-0`
// come before `top-0`, and `getPropertySort` calls `.indexOf` on it. Mirroring it is the faithful
// thing; reading it at lint time would be the same table with extra steps.
//
//	PropertyOrder                  359   property-order.ts
//	SortOverrideProperties          12   the --tw-sort overrides
//	FrameworkVariantRegistrations   88   variants.ts registrations
//	FrameworkStaticDeclarations    890   staticUtility calls
//	FrameworkFunctionalUtilities    33   functionalUtility registrations
//	FrameworkMultiDeclarationUtilities
//	                               152   functionalUtility registrations
//	VariantOrder                   145   the order numbers those registrations sort at
//	FrameworkNamespaces             14   the theme namespaces a root consumes, all Tailwind's own
//	baseReadings                   374   readings of Tailwind's own utilities, held by the differential
//	baseStatics                    869   readings of Tailwind's own statics, same
//
// # Ours, each answering something a reading cannot
//
// A reading is a sorted set of property positions and a count. `getPropertySort` reads
// `node.property` and increments a counter, and never reads a value. That single fact is what made
// this port tractable, deleting roughly 85% of `utilities.ts`, and it is also the reason these two
// tables cannot be derived from what the port carries.
//
//	baseDescriptors          78   the reading partitions on the value's resolved type, and no
//	                              registration shape carries both halves: `border-[3px]` is a width
//	                              and `border-red-500` is a colour.
//	CollapseFamilies         45   which pairs canonicalize into a third root. All 45 are CSS
//	                              shorthand relationships between declared properties, so deriving
//	                              it means carrying a shorthand table of equal size, one layer
//	                              further from the question.
//
// `RootDeclaredProperties` and its three companions were here until #mz0m6k8, carried for exactly the
// reason the paragraph below rejected. The emitting half is now ported, so the answer is computed by
// `DeclaredPropertiesFor` and the four tables, 1,183 entries and 62 KB, are deleted.
//
// `ComposingRoots` went the same way in #gb4bkgc, and its reason had read as the strongest of the
// four. A reading cannot answer whether two values of a root layer or overwrite, which is true and
// was never the question: the emitters can, once they stop flattening the constant each layering
// family writes to its shared property. 81 of its 82 rows answered and all 81 agreed before it was
// deleted, and the 82nd was not a utility. Its answers are kept as a fixture in composes_test.go.
//
// # Why not port the emitting half and delete the rest
//
// Measured rather than assumed. `utilities.ts` holds 582 `decl()` call sites and 374 of them compute
// their value, which means porting `color-mix`, `withAlpha`, `calc` and the 729-reference `--tw-*`
// var chain. That is the surface this port deleted on purpose. It would cost more than the four
// tables together and buy nothing: the differential holds at 95,931 answered with 17 disagreements,
// all named and tested.
//
// # What this test actually asserts
//
// The counts, so a table growing or shrinking without its reason being revisited fails here. The
// reasons themselves are prose and cannot be asserted, which is why each table also carries its own
// test: the collapse families assert their shorthand structure, the descriptor rows are compared
// class for class by the differential, and the upstream diff catches Tailwind's own data moving.

// Tables the inventory deliberately does not carry an entry for, each with the reason.
//
// The inventory is about tables that answer a question upstream answers by running code, because
// those are the ones that go stale against a repository or a Tailwind version. Three kinds do not:
//
// The ported handle bodies. `frameworkEmitters`, `frameworkMultiEmitters`,
// `frameworkMultiLiteralEmitters` and `gapEmitters` are the port's own source, one closure per root
// read at the tag. They are code written as a map, not data recording what code produced, and
// TestEveryFrameworkRootHasAnEmitter already holds them against the registration tables.
//
// The CSS grammar. `lengthUnits`, `angleUnits`, `mathFunctions`, `imageFunctions`,
// `gradientFunctions`, `colorFunctions`, `namedColors`, `genericNames`, `absoluteSizes`,
// `backgroundPositionKeywords`, `percentSuffix` and `colorKeywords` are facts about CSS rather than
// about Tailwind or about a repository. They move when the CSS specification moves, which is not the
// drift this inventory watches, and upstream carries the same lists for the same reason.
//
// Small local constants. `ignoredThemeKeys`, `bareValueDataTypes`, `themedModifierValues`,
// `composedAggregateValues` and `FrameworkVariantComparisonGroups` are each read by one function in
// the file that declares them and are part of that function's definition.
//
// An entry here is a claim that a table cannot go stale against a repository. Adding one to silence
// a failure rather than because that claim is true is the failure mode, and it is not defended
// against: measured, adding a two-entry table to this package and an exemption for it turns the
// check green. That is the honest limit of this test. It catches a table added and forgotten, which
// is what happened to `KnownRoots`, `KnownStatics` and the three ordering tables, and it does not
// catch a table added deliberately with a false reason.
//
// Each is grouped under a reason above rather than listed bare, so the claim is at least written
// down where review can see it.
