// TestWave3RootsAreAlreadyAnsweredByTheDescriptorTable is the measurement that ended wave 3.
//
// The 26 direct `utilities.functional` registrations were scoped as the last porting wave: the color
// families, the shadows, the transforms, `flex`, `bg-linear`. Seventeen of them read differently
// depending on their value, which is what made them look like the hard case.
//
// They are the case the descriptor model was built for. A root's reading being a pure function of its
// value's resolved type is exactly what `Table.Lookup` answers, and Phase 0 measured that model on
// 37,643 registry classes before any of this port existed. So these roots needed no new table, and
// this test is the evidence rather than a claim: every one of them is compared against the engine
// through the existing lookup.
//
// Kept as a standing test rather than deleted after the measurement, because the interesting failure
// is the future one. If a wave-4 change or a Tailwind bump makes one of these roots stop being a pure
// function of its type, this is where it shows up, and the answer then is a new table rather than a
// wider descriptor.

// `bareReading` walks the theme namespaces longest-first, and the file comment calls that order part

// differential, and this is the measurement behind that rather than a shrug.
//
// The order is observable only when a key belongs to two namespaces AND some root consumes both. The
// second half nearly holds: `font` consumes `--font-weight` and `--font`, the only such root of the
// 84 namespaces here. The first half does not. `bold` and `medium` are keys of `--font-weight`
// alone, `sans` of `--font` alone, so the loop's membership guard admits exactly one namespace per
// key and the order it tries them in cannot matter.
//
// So the ordering is correct, unexercised, and worth keeping: a repository declaring `--font-bold`
// alongside the framework's `--font-weight-bold` would make it load-bearing immediately, and this
// test is what turns that from a silent behaviour change into a failure. It fails when the corpus
// gains an ambiguous key, which is the moment the mutation becomes possible and is owed.
