// The value-resolution pipeline every framework functional utility runs.
//
// Ported from `functionalUtility` and its inner `handleFunctionalUtility` in `src/utilities.ts` at
// Tailwind 4.3.3, read at the pinned tag rather than from the minified bundle, so a disagreement
// with the engine is a finding rather than version skew.
//
// # What this is and what it deliberately is not
//
// Upstream's `functionalUtility` does two things: it turns a candidate's value into a resolved CSS
// value, and it hands that value to the root's own `handle` body which emits declarations. This file
// is the first half only. The `handle` bodies are 114 separate functions and they are #271785y.
//
// The split is not arbitrary. The resolution above is one function shared by every functional root,
// so an inexact port corrupts every reading downstream at once, in the direction of a plausible
// answer rather than an error. The handle bodies fail one root at a time and are visible against the
// engine per root. Testing them together would let a resolution defect hide behind a handler that
// happens to emit the same properties for two different values.
//
// # The order is the contract
//
// Five branches, and their order decides the answer rather than merely organising it:
//
//  1. No value at all: `defaultValue` when the descriptor defines one, otherwise a bare theme lookup.
//     A modifier with no value produces nothing, which is why `bg-red-500/50` resolves and `bg/50`
//     does not.
//  2. An arbitrary value: taken as written, carrying its typehint if the author gave one. A modifier
//     again produces nothing.
//  3. A named value: the theme first, by `theme.resolve(fraction ?? value, themeKeys)`. Theme before
//     inference is refinement 2 from Phase 0 and it is load-bearing: `bold` is a `--font-weight` key
//     that also satisfies `family-name`, so inferring first reads `font-bold` as a font family.
//  4. Fractions, when the root supports them and the theme did not answer. `w-1/2` becomes
//     `calc(1 / 2 * 100%)` without `1/2` existing as a theme value.
//  5. Bare values, negative first when the candidate was negative, then the ordinary handler, then
//     `staticValues` as a last resort.
//
// # Two details that are easy to port wrongly and produce plausible answers
//
// A bare handler that returns a value without a `/` cancels the whole utility when a modifier is
// present. Upstream spells this `if (!value?.includes('/') && candidate.modifier) return`, and it is
// what stops `grow-2/3` from reading as `grow` with a stray modifier. Dropping the test leaves those
// classes resolving to something, which sorts, which is why it would not surface as an error.
//
// A negative candidate wraps its resolved value in `calc(<value> * -1)` and routes it through
// `addWhitespaceAroundMathOperators`. Emitting `calc(<value>*-1)` instead is the same CSS and a
// different string, and since this port compares readings rather than text it would pass every
// assertion here while disagreeing with the engine anywhere the text reaches a data-type inference.
