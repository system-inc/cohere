// The descriptor model: a utility root's `{order, count}` reading as a function of its value.
//
// This is the data structure Phase 0 proved and the lookup that consumes it. The claim it rests on
// is that a functional utility's reading is decided by its value's inferred data type rather than by
// evaluating the utility, which is what lets `utilities.ts` (6,827 lines, most of it computing
// values `getPropertySort` never reads) collapse to a few hundred rows.
//
// The claim was measured before any of this was written, against the shipped engine on two
// repositories: 37,625 of 37,643 registry classes, every sampled modifier class, and 132,199 of
// 132,203 arbitrary probes over 327 roots and 527 value shapes. See
// `tools/gen_tailwind_descriptors/README.md`, which is the specification this file implements. The
// numbers there are reproduced by running the extractor, not quoted from memory.
//
// # The descriptor is four things, and each correction cost a population of mispredictions
//
// The model as originally stated was `{typeList, readingByType}`, and it is right in outline and
// wrong in four ways that only a measurement finds. Every one of them is load-bearing here:
//
//  1. The type list is ordered, and the order is per-root. `InferDataType` returns the first match,
//     so `bg` listing `position` before `length` makes `bg-[3px]` a position reading `[254]` rather
//     than a length reading `[251]`. Fifty-eight probes turn on that single inversion. The order is
//     recovered by topological sort from observation in the extractor and carried here verbatim.
//     Sorting a TypeList, or building one from `AllDataTypes`, is a silent behavior change.
//
//  2. A bare value is resolved before it is inferred, in a fixed precedence: root literals, colour
//     keywords, theme namespaces longest-first, inference, then the `@none` reading. Theme before
//     inference is what `bold` proves: it is a `--font-weight` key that also satisfies
//     `family-name`, so inferring first reads `font-bold` as a font family. Eight registry classes
//     separate the two orderings. The last step is `@none` rather than the axis fallback, and the
//     two are different readings on 20 roots in this repository.
//
//  3. A modifier is a third axis with three states rather than a flag. `text-[3px]/50` emits a
//     `line-height` and `shadow-[3px]/50` emits an alpha, so a modifier moves the reading; `/none`
//     is a `--leading` key rather than an alpha, so it moves it differently. The modifier's value is
//     otherwise not consulted, which is what keeps the axis cheap: `/50`, `/[0.5]` and
//     `/[var(--a)]` are one bucket.
//
//  4. A type can discriminate on one axis and carry no information on another. `color` reads like
//     the fallback for `text-shadow` unmodified and is exactly what separates it under a modifier.
//     So a type's presence in TypeList is not evidence that it appears in every reading map.
//
// # What this file does not cover, and must not pretend to
//
// Two exceptions were measured, both understood, both countable, and both are answered here with
// "no descriptor answer" rather than a guess:
//
//   - 18 registry classes of the form `<animation-root>-translate-full`, from repository `@utility`
//     blocks whose arity is the count of surviving declarations. `50` is both an `integer` and a
//     `--percentage-*` key, so two declarations survive; `4` is only an integer, so one does. Arity
//     is therefore not a function of any single data type, which is the boundary of this model
//     rather than a defect in it. Answering them is the `@utility` evaluator's job.
//
//   - 4 sweep probes hitting an upstream shadow quirk on `[16/9]` values, where the handler splits
//     an arbitrary value on `/` looking for a colour slot and emits garbage CSS. No registry
//     contains them. Recorded, not modelled.
//
// A lookup that returned a plausible reading for these would be wrong in the one place the model
// knows it cannot answer, so `Lookup` reports `false` and lets the caller escalate.
//
// # Where a shortcut here returns the right answer for the wrong reason
//
// The generated table is small because readings are interned and because buckets equal to their
// axis fallback are dropped. The elision is correct for `ByType`, where a miss ends the lookup at
// the fallback, and wrong for `ByNamespace`, where a miss continues the bare-value precedence to
// inference instead. Applying it to both looked structural and symmetric while it was being
// written, and it silently changed 647 namespace buckets across 303 roots.
//
// It is worth stating plainly because of how it failed. Every one of those 647 still produced a
// well-formed reading, the table got 45 KB smaller, and the only symptom was that `font-bold` read
// `[284]#1` instead of `[288]#2`. Nothing but a comparison against the engine over the whole
// registry would have found it, which is why this package is tested that way rather than against
// its own expectations. See AxisReadings.ByNamespace.
