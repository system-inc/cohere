// The seam: one repository's whole design system, assembled once and then read-only.
//
// Nine components landed before this file and each answers one question well. None of them knows
// how to be assembled, and that is deliberate: a component that reached for a repository path would
// be untestable without one. This file is where the reaching happens, exactly once, and it is the
// only file in the package that reads the filesystem outside a test.
//
// # What "run-scoped" has to mean, and why it is a test rather than a comment
//
// `LoadDesignSystem` walks an `@import` graph, parses every stylesheet in it, and fills a Theme.
// That is cheap once and ruinous per file. The precedent is in this repository and it is not
// hypothetical: `boundary-no-project-theme-value` memoized nothing and rescanned the program per
// file, measured at 2,329ms of setup against 0.54ms of listening across 1,862 files — 64.5% of all
// rule time for a rule that reported nothing. Nothing failed. It was just slow, and its own comment
// said the scan happened once.
//
// Measured here: a full load of this repository's `theme.css` graph is 0.68ms warm, 9 stylesheets
// resolving 744 theme entries and 37 `@utility` blocks. Per-file across 1,862 files that is 1.27
// seconds of pure waste, and the shape of the failure is that every test still passes. So
// `BuildCount` exists on the loaded value and
// `internal/rules/tailwind` asserts it, because a counter is the only form of the build-once claim
// that cannot decay into a lie without something turning red.
//
// # Immutable after build
//
// `internal/program/walk.go` runs up to 16 goroutines striding over files with one mutex for the
// final merge only. A DesignSystem is therefore shared across all of them with no synchronization
// at all, which is safe only because nothing here is written after LoadDesignSystem returns. Every
// table this composes is already immutable — Theme, VariantRegistry and UtilityEvaluator each say
// so in their own doc comments — and this file keeps that property rather than introducing the
// package's first mutable one. `MarkUsedVariable` is the one method on Theme that writes, and the
// Theme accessor's own comment says so rather than the type enforcing it, because Go has no way to
// hand out a read-only view of a struct with pointer methods.
//
// # What is composed, and what is honestly still generated
//
// The end state of #twgo is a design system built entirely from the repository. This is not that
// yet, and the split is named rather than blurred:
//
//	from the repository   the Theme, its prefix, every `@utility` block, every `@custom-variant`
//	                      name. All of it parsed out of the repository's own stylesheet graph by
//	                      the components that landed tonight.
//	still generated       which roots the framework itself registers, carried as `KnownRoots` and
//	                      `KnownStatics`, and their readings, carried as `baseDescriptors` in
//	                      descriptor_base_table.go. Framework-invariant, and that was re-measured
//	                      rather than inherited: byte-identical `roots` arrays across the two corpus
//	                      repositories is *not* evidence, because they share the Structure submodule
//	                      and so share its `@theme` and its `@utility` blocks. Against a third,
//	                      synthetic design system sharing neither, 258 of 301 shared roots differ,
//	                      and every one differs only in its namespace maps. With those removed all
//	                      three agree exactly, which is the seam descriptor_live.go composes across.
//	also generated        the framework's own variant registrations, carried as
//	                      `FrameworkVariantRegistrations` and keyed on registration roots. Verified
//	                      repository-invariant across two installs and both corpus repositories
//	                      before being checked in, so a table is the correct shape for it. The
//	                      comparison functions those registrations reference are *not* generated:
//	                      they resolve breakpoint widths out of the live theme, because a repository
//	                      that redefines `--breakpoint-sm` reorders its own responsive classes.
//	                      `VariantOrder` in property_order_table.go is a different table, keyed on
//	                      composed prefixes (`group-hover:`) rather than on registration roots,
//	                      which is the shape variant.go's file comment argues against.
//
// A reader should be able to see that boundary without running anything, which is why
// `RepositoryContributions` reports what the repository added on top of the framework rather than
// leaving it to be inferred.
//
// # Failing safe
//
// A design system that will not build is no opinion, never a clean tree. LoadDesignSystem returns
// an error and the caller declines; it never returns a half-built value. verify exists to eliminate
// confident green over unchecked work, and a rule reporting zero findings because the CSS could not
// be read is exactly that failure wearing the right colour.
