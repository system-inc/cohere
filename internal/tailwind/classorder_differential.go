// The Tier 2 differential: `{order, count}` per class, over a whole registry, against the engine.
//
// This is the tier above the per-component fixtures rather than a replacement for them. Six
// components have landed and each carries an engine-verified corpus of its own, which is the right
// shape for testing a component and cannot see the thing this file exists to see.
//
// # What a component fixture cannot reach
//
// `descriptor_fixtures.json` hands the Go side a value that has already been decoded: a
// `{kind, root, value, modifier}` the JavaScript extractor parsed, with the question "does Lookup
// map this to the right reading". That tests the lookup exactly, and it steps over the seam. A class
// is a *string*. Turning the string into a candidate is `ParseCandidate`'s job, and a suite that
// begins from a candidate has tested both halves while never testing the join.
//
// The precedent is on the record in this slice. `segment` was verified exclusively through
// `InferDataType`, which launders its errors, so mutations to `segment` changed nothing any test
// could observe. A component reachable only through its caller is not tested — and a *seam* is
// reachable only through a fixture that has already crossed it, so the same hole applies one level
// up. This file starts from the class name and ends at the reading, and everything between is the
// Go side's problem, which is the point.
//
// # The outcome lattice, and why silence is a bucket rather than a pass
//
// Every class lands in exactly one Outcome. The lattice is the whole design, because the failure
// this harness was built to refuse is a differential that scores mutual silence as agreement. In the
// ahra corpus 10 of 1,208 distinct classes return null from the engine, and the expanded registry
// adds 30 more per system where the engine advertises a modifier it then refuses. Those are the
// classes most likely to break and the ones a naive differential is blind to, so `BothSilent` is
// counted, reported, and bounded — never folded into agreement.
//
// The rate a reader trusts is therefore computed over *answered* classes, and the silent counts are
// asserted separately against measured figures. A run in which every class went silent scores an
// agreement rate of zero over an empty denominator rather than a hundred percent over nothing, and
// a Population that fell below its floor disqualifies the comparison before any rate is read.
//
// # The vocabulary is `internal/differential`'s
//
// `Population`, `Control` and `ControlsProven` are that package's ideas and are not renamed here:
// the empty diff is not proof of agreement, and a harness that has never returned a positive has not
// been shown able to. `Finding` does not transfer, since a per-class `{order, count}` comparison is
// not keyed like a rule finding, so this file carries `Divergence` instead and says so rather than
// inventing a second word for the same concept.
