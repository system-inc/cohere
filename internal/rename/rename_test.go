// # What this test taught, which was not what it was written to show
//
// It was written for a surviving mutant, on the hypothesis that the resolver needed an
// innermost-wins rule because `value.toUpperCase()` nests two identifiers. The mutant survived the
// new fixture too, which per the discipline means the hypothesis was wrong rather than the fixture
// being insufficient.
//
// Probing the parse shape settled it: identifiers are LEAF tokens and their spans never overlap —
// 25 identifiers across the fixture, zero offsets contained by two spans. `value` and `toUpperCase`
// are siblings, not nested, and the enclosing property-access expression is not an identifier so the
// walk never sees it. First-match and last-match are therefore equivalent, recorded at the line in
// `resolveAnchor`.
//
// The test is kept because the property it actually asserts is still worth holding: a column in the
// middle of a line selects the identifier at that column. It simply is not the guard for the
// mutation that prompted it.
