// GraphQlOperationContextMatchesReturn holds the generic on an injected operation context to the

//
//	valid:   @GraphQlQuery(() => Thing)
//	         async find(@InjectGraphQlOperationContext() c: GraphQlOperationContext<Thing>):
//	             Promise<Thing>
//	invalid: the same with GraphQlOperationContext<Other>
//	invalid: the same with the parameter typed as something that is not an operation context
//
// The context object carries the selection set the caller asked for, and its generic is what tells
// the resolver which fields it may read. When that generic and the method's return type disagree,
// the resolver is reading a selection set for a different shape than the one it returns, and
// nothing else notices: both types exist, both compile, and the mismatch surfaces as fields
// silently missing at run time.
//
// # What this rule deliberately does not check, because a sibling already does
//
// Whether the parameter's BASE type is an operation context at all is `inject-type-matches-parameter`'s
// question, answered through the decorator's branded resolved type. This rule reports a wrong base
// type anyway, under its own message, because it has already resolved the type and the alternative
// is silence on the shape that most needs saying something. The original's header comment states
// this split, and the second message id exists to keep the two findings distinguishable.
//
// # The comparison is bidirectional assignability, not identity
//
// Both directions are asserted, which is stricter than either alone and weaker than reference
// identity. A subtype passing one direction is not enough: `Derived` and `Base` are mutually
// unassignable in exactly one direction each, and a resolver returning `Base` while reading a
// `Derived` selection set is the defect this rule exists for. Identity would be too strict, because
// the two types are reached by different routes and a structurally identical alias should pass.
//
// # Both sides are unwrapped to their element type first
//
// `Promise<Readonly<Thing[]>>` and `Thing` describe the same selection set, so the comparison is
// made after stripping the wrappers that do not change it. That unwrap is recursive and its exact
// set is the original's: promise, readonly alias, a nullable union with exactly one non-nullish
// member, and array or readonly array. Anything else is left alone.
//
// # No repair
//
// The original ships none and neither does this. The two ways to satisfy the rule are to change the
// generic or to change the return type, and which one is right depends on what the resolver is
// meant to do, which is not recoverable from the source.
