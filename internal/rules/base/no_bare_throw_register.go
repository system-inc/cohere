// No Decode entry, because the original's `schema` is `[]` and the rule reads no options at all.
//
// Registered and NOT enabled. `api-phi-health` carries no CohereSettings.json of its own, and ahra's
// config names no `base/` keys because base is that project's layer rather than ahra's. Where these
// rules get turned on is a decision for whoever owns that configuration, and a port that enabled
// itself would be making it silently.
