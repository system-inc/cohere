// The rule is registered and DELIBERATELY NOT ENABLED. api-phi-health has no CohereSettings.json of
// its own, and ahra's config carries no `base/` keys because base is that project's layer rather
// than ahra's, so where this gets enabled is a decision rather than an omission.
//
// No Decode entry: the original's `schema: []` means the rule has no option surface at all.
