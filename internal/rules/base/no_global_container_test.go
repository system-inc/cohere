// no fixture-provenance question. That inverts the usual guidance: a fixture invented here would
// encode the same belief as the rule, and pass for exactly the reason the rule is wrong.
//
// So every row was measured by DRIVING the real rule from api-phi-health, loaded directly with its
// @nexus alias supplied by a loader hook, over the exact source text below. Two of them taught this
// port something it would not have invented: a property key reports, and a locally declared
// function of that name reports too.
