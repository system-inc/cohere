// one Tester block, 18 pass and 12 fail, and the snapshot records 12 diagnostics from those 12 fail
// inputs, so one finding per input is measured here rather than assumed. Pulled with the
// extractor's own Rust parser rather than transcribed by eye, because the options tuple is the half
// a transcription drops and an options case read as a defaults case asserts nothing about the option.

// The option is `enforceForOrderingRelations`, default false. Note that the same four inputs appear
// on both sides of the corpus, differing only in whether the option is set: `if (! a < b) {}` is
// clean by default and reports with the option on. That pairing is the whole reason the option

// applies to `a` alone, and reporting it would be telling them their explicit grouping is a
// mistake. Our AST keeps a ParenthesizedExpression node there, so the kind check declines it with
// no paren logic at all, and `ast.SkipParentheses` (which ten rules in this package reach for)
// would unwrap it into a false positive. Verified by probing our parser rather than reasoned about:
// `(!a) in b` yields KindParenthesizedExpression on the left, `!(a) in b` yields
// KindPrefixUnaryExpression, and those two go opposite ways in the corpus.

// an explicitly empty options object, and including under an explicit false.
