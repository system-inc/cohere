	Description: "The update clause of this loop moves the counter away from the condition, so the " +
		"condition can never become false and the loop runs forever. Nothing about this fails to " +
		"compile and nothing throws: the program simply stops making progress, which is why it is " +
		"usually found by a hung process rather than by reading the loop.",
}

// ForDirection flags a for loop whose update moves the counter away from its condition.
//
//	valid:   for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
//	valid:   for(let i = 10; i > 0; i--)
//	valid:   for(let i = 0; i < 10; i += step)   // step is not statically known
//	invalid: for(let i = 0; i < 10; i--)
//	invalid: for(let i = 10; i > 0; i++)
//	invalid: for(let i = 0; i < 10; i -= 1)
//
// The counter may sit on either side of the condition, and which side it is on flips what counts as
// wrong: `i < 10` wants an increment, `10 > i` wants one too, and a rule checking only the left
// operand is silent on half the loops anyone writes. Both sides are checked, matching ESLint.
//
// A report needs exactly one expression modifying the counter. `for(...; ...; i++, i--)` is
// ambiguous rather than wrong, and ESLint deliberately says nothing about it: the loop may be
// doing something deliberate that no syntactic reading can settle. The count is what makes that
// distinction, so a sequence expression is walked to count modifications rather than to find the
// first one.
//
// The compound-assignment arm asks for a statically known sign, and that is the only place this
// rule can be uncertain. `i += step` is not reported because step could be negative, and reporting
// it would flag a correct loop. ESLint reaches for its scope analysis here and resolves a `const`
// binding to its value; ours reads only literals and their unary negations, which is a deliberate
// narrowing recorded below.
