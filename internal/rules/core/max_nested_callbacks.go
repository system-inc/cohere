//
// Hand-rolled rather than `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` because the wire value is polymorphic, the
// default is not the zero value, and the two spellings of the limit interact in a way no struct tag
// can express.
//
// The value may be a bare INTEGER: verify's config layer strips the severity tuple, so a config
// writing `["error", 3]` hands this the JSON `3`, which no struct can unmarshal.
//
// An ABSENT value must mean 10 rather than 0. A rule configured as a bare `"error"` reaches the
// decoder with empty input, and a plain int field would read that as a limit of zero, reporting
// every callback in the tree. That is the live config's own shape, so it is the ordinary path.
//
// An object with NEITHER key must also mean 10. Upstream reaches the object arm only when
// `Object.hasOwn(option, "maximum") || Object.hasOwn(option, "max")`, so `{}` and
// `{checkConstructorCallCallbacks: true}` both leave the limit at ten. Measured against the
// installed build at 10.8.1: `[{}]` is clean on a two-deep nest that `[{max: 1}]` reports.
//
// # An upstream defect this reproduces
//
// Upstream resolves the two spellings with `option.maximum || option.max`, which is a truthiness
// test rather than a presence test, so a `maximum` of ZERO falls through to `max`. Measured:
//
//	[{maximum: 0, max: 5}]   clean on a one-deep callback, so the limit in force is 5
//	[{maximum: 5, max: 1}]   clean on a two-deep nest, so the limit in force is 5
//	[{maximum: 1, max: 5}]   reports on a two-deep nest, so the limit in force is 1
//
// A user who writes `{maximum: 0, max: 5}` asking for zero silently gets five. Reproduced rather
// than corrected, because a port that quietly disagrees with the tool it is compared against turns
// a shared defect into a divergence nobody can see. The intuitive reading is that an explicit 0
// wins, and it is wrong.

//
// # What counts, and what the depth is counted over
//
// Only a function that is an ARGUMENT to a call counts. A function that is the callee does not, so
// an immediately invoked expression is clean at a limit of zero, and neither does a function stored
// in a variable, held in an object property, or used as a method body. Those all appear in the
// corpus and each one is a class of false positive a looser reading would ship.
//
// The count is the depth of the callback CHAIN rather than the number of callbacks in the file.
// Upstream pushes on entering such a function and pops on leaving it, so two callbacks side by side
// at the same level each reach depth one. Three of upstream's invalid cases exist only to pin this:
// each writes a function declaration or an unrelated callback beside the nest and asserts a single
// finding rather than several.
//
// # Why this walks the tree itself
//
// Upstream keeps its stack with paired enter and exit listeners. This tree has no exit hook and the
// walk is pre-order, so a listener on the function kinds could push and never pop, and the depth
// would grow monotonically over the file: the second sibling callback would report at a depth the
// first one earned. So the whole judgment happens under one KindSourceFile listener, which fires
// before its children, and the recursion carries the depth down and unwinds it on return. That is
// the shipped shape for a rule that has to gather before it can judge.
//
// # Where a finding points
//
// At the function HEAD rather than the whole function, which upstream gets from
// `astUtils.getFunctionHeadLoc`. That helper has three branches and only two are reachable here:
//
//	an arrow                     the `=>` token alone, so `async () => {}` reports on the arrow
//	                             and not on the `async`
//	anything else                the function's own start through to the opening paren of its
//	                             parameters, so `async function*` and `function named` are both
//	                             covered whole while the parameter list is not
//	a Property or method parent   UNREACHABLE from this rule
//
// The third branch is the one worth writing down. A function whose parent is an object property or
// a class method is never a call argument, so `checkFunction` returns before it can report, and no
// input can reach that branch through this rule. Measured against the installed build rather than
// argued: `foo(function(){ bar({m: function(){}}) })` and the shorthand `bar({m(){}})` are both
// clean at a limit of 1 while the same shape with a bare function argument reports. The callers
// enumerated for that verdict are the two listeners upstream registers and nothing else; a future
// change that counted method bodies would void it.
