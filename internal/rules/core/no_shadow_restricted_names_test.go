// and 24 fail. The snapshot records 69 diagnostics from those 24 inputs, so one finding per input
// is badly wrong here and the extractor said so before any code was written. The counts below were
// recovered per input from the source line each snapshot diagnostic prints, rather than by walking
// the snapshot in order: upstream lists the twelve-diagnostic `globalThis` case twice
// byte-identically, and an in-order walk would hand all twelve to the first copy.
//
// The dense cases are dense for a reason worth stating. `function NaN(NaN) { var NaN; !function
// NaN(NaN) { try {} catch(NaN) {} }; }` is six separate bindings named `NaN` in five scopes, and it
// reports six times. That single input is most of this rule's declaration-site coverage, which is
// why a port that finds only variable declarations still passes a suite asserting one finding per
// input and fails this one loudly.
