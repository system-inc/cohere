// NoThisBeforeSuper requires a derived class constructor to call `super()` before it touches
// `this` or `super`.
//
// In a derived constructor the binding for `this` does not exist until `super()` returns. Reading
// it first is not a style problem: it throws a ReferenceError at runtime, on the first construction,
// every time. The rule exists because the failure is invisible in review and the stack trace points
// at the property access rather than at the missing call.
//
// Examples of incorrect code:
//
//	class A extends B { constructor() { this.c = 0; super(); } }
//	class A extends B { constructor() { super.c(); } }
//	class A extends B { constructor() { super(this.c); } }
//	class A extends B { constructor() { if (a) super(); this.a(); } }
//
// Examples of correct code:
//
//	class A extends B { constructor() { super(); this.c = 0; } }
//	class A { constructor() { this.c = 0; } }
//	class A extends null { constructor() { } }
//	class A extends B { constructor() { var c = () => this.d(); super(); } }
//
// # Reporting granularity, and why oxc rather than ESLint
//
// The two upstreams disagree about what a finding is, and the disagreement is visible rather than
// hidden. ESLint reports once per offending `this` or `super` node, with the message
// `'this' is not allowed before 'super()'`. Oxc reports once per offending *constructor*, anchored
// on the whole method definition.
//
// Oxc's granularity is reproduced here, because the snapshot is what pins the port: 26 fail inputs
// producing exactly 26 diagnostics, several of which contain two offending nodes.
// `class A extends B { constructor() { super(this.c); } }` has one, but
// `try { super(); } finally { this.a; }` reaches its `this` on two paths and still reports once.
// Choosing ESLint's granularity would make the imported corpus unable to check the port, which is
// the only thing the corpus is for.
//
// The cost is a wider caret. A reader gets the constructor underlined rather than the offending
// access, and in a long constructor that is less precise than it could be. It is stated here rather
// than quietly improved on, because a divergence that is written down is a decision and one that is
// not is a defect.
//
// # There is no control flow graph here, and the question does not need one
//
// Upstream reaches for oxc's CFG (`ctx.cfg()`), partitions basic blocks into "super was called" and
// "a violation happened locally", then walks edges propagating the first set across the second. We
// have no CFG. TypeScript's flow graph is not a substitute and this was measured rather than
// assumed: `ast.FlowNode` carries `Antecedent` and `Antecedents` and no successor edges anywhere in
// `typescript-go/tsc/internal/ast/flow.go`, because it exists for *narrowing* and is keyed on the
// expression positions where a type could change. There is no `super()` instruction in it to find.
//
// So the analysis here is structural, over the statement tree, and it reproduces upstream's verdict
// on every discrimination the corpus draws. The question this rule asks turns out to be a good fit
// for the tree, better than `getter-return`'s was, because it decomposes into two independent
// passes that each read the tree the obvious way:
//
//	definitelyCallsSuper(statement)   does every path through this statement call super()?
//	findViolation(statement)          walking in source order, is a this/super reached
//	                                  while definitelyCallsSuper has not yet been satisfied?
//
// The first is a *must* analysis and the direction of its uncertainty is what makes the port
// correct. Anything it cannot prove answers false, so an unrecognised construct is treated as not
// calling `super()`, and the rule reports. For a correctness rule that is the right bias, and it is
// also what upstream does: its `Maybe` states resolve toward reporting.
//
// Four constructs carry the whole judgment and each one is in the corpus twice, once in each
// direction:
//
//	if       calls only when it has an else and both arms call
//	try      calls when the finally calls, or when the try calls and there is no catch
//	loops    never count, because the body may run zero times
//	logical  `&&=`, `||=`, `??=` never count, because they short-circuit
//
// The loop rule and the try rule are the two that look like limitations and are not. Upstream fails
// `while (foo) { super(); } this.a();` for exactly the reason given here, and passes
// `try { super(); } finally {} this.a();` while failing
// `try { super(); } catch (err) { } this.a;`, because a catch can swallow a throw from `super()`
// itself and leave `this` unbound.
//
// # What counts as a violation, verified against the corpus rather than assumed
//
// Three questions had to be answered before writing this and all three are pinned by pass cases.
//
// A `this` inside a *nested* function, arrow, or class does not count. Five pass cases say so, and
// they include an arrow, which is the one that looks like it should differ: an arrow does inherit
// the enclosing `this` binding lexically, so `() => this.d()` really does read the constructor's
// `this`. It is still clean, because the arrow *body* does not run at the point it is written. The
// distinction the rule draws is about evaluation time, not about binding, which is why the arrow
// and the function expression land in the same place for different reasons.
//
// A class field initializer does not count, in either direction. Four pass cases, including
// `class C extends B { field = this.foo(); constructor() { } }`, where the initializer is never
// evaluated at all because the constructor never calls `super()`.
//
// `super.method()` counts exactly like `this`. `super.c()` before `super()` is a fail case, because
// the home-object lookup that `super.x` performs also requires the `this` binding.
//
// And `super()` in callee position is not itself a violation, which is why the check asks whether
// the `super` keyword is the callee of its parent call rather than simply whether a `super` token
// appeared.

// two appear as different operator tokens on the same node kind, and a single predicate covering
// both would be a list of six with no shared meaning at the call site.

// Arrows are included even though they inherit `this` lexically, because what the rule measures is
// when the body evaluates rather than which binding it would see. Upstream agrees, with
