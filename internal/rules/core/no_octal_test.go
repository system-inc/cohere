// There is no imported corpus for this rule, and that is the most important thing to know before
// reading the fixtures below.
//
// oxc has no `no_octal.rs`. Confirmed by grepping the whole `oxc_linter` crate for `no-octal` and
// `NoOctal` and getting zero from both, with `no-with` and `NoWith` run as controls through the
// same commands and hitting. So there is no inline Rust corpus and no snapshot diagnostic count.
// ESLint is the port target instead, and ESLint does not ship its `tests/` directory, so its corpus
// is genuinely unavailable rather than merely unread.
//
// Every case below is therefore one this port invented, which makes this a weaker artifact than a
// rule with an imported floor. The usual protection is that upstream's clean cases were each added
// when somebody hit that bug, so they catch a porter who reasoned the way the porter is about to
// reason. Nobody wrote them here.
//
// Two things were done instead of relying on that floor.
//
// First, the expectations were taken from running ESLint's own rule rather than from reading its
// regular expression and predicting. That matters: reading `/^0\d/u` and reasoning about what a
// legacy octal is produces the confident and wrong belief that `08` and `09` are clean, since they
// are legal decimals and not octal at all. Running the rule shows it reports them. So the fixtures
// below encode measured upstream behavior rather than a porter's model of it, and where they look
// surprising, that surprise is the measurement.
//
// Second, the mutation sweep was run harder than usual, because with no imported corpus these
// fixtures are the only evidence, and a surviving mutant here is a genuine hole rather than an
// upstream blind spot inherited honestly.

// A legacy octal is a leading `0` followed immediately by a decimal digit, and every one of these
// was confirmed reported by ESLint's own rule before it was written down here.
//
// The last four are the ones a porter gets wrong. `08`, `09`, `019` and `0195` are not octal: `8`
// and `9` are not octal digits, so these are NonOctalDecimalIntegerLiterals and evaluate in base
// ten. Upstream reports them anyway, and deliberately, because they are the same banned legacy
// grammar production and are a syntax error in strict mode for the same reason the octals are. A
// port that "corrects" this by checking the digits are octal-legal diverges from upstream silently
// and is the single most likely way to get this rule wrong.

// The clean cases are the whole rule, since firing on a leading zero is easy and declining is the

//
// They fail in different ways and each pins a distinct mistake:
//
//	`0`         a bare zero has no following digit. A rule testing only `raw[0] == '0'` reports it,
//	            and zero is the most common literal in any codebase, so that mistake is loud.
//	`0.5`, `0.0` the character after the zero is a dot rather than a digit.
//	`0e5`       likewise an exponent marker, and its value is zero, so a rule reasoning about the
//	            value rather than the spelling has no way to tell it from `0`.
//	`0x1F`      hexadecimal. Modern-prefixed and not the legacy grammar.
//	`0o755`     the modern octal, which is the fix upstream wants and must never be reported. A rule
//	            that lowercases or normalizes before matching reports the very form it is asking for.
//	`0O755`     the same with a capital `O`, which is the case-folding mistake specifically.
//	`0b11`      binary, the third modern prefix.
//	`1e3`, `.5` no leading zero at all, the negative controls.
//	the string  `"0755"` has the text but is not a numeric literal, and the rule keys on the node
//	            being a number. A rule matching on source text reports it.
//	the comment likewise, and a comment is not a node at all.

// Cases written from reading *our* parser rather than upstream's, because this is where the port

//
// TypeScript's parser recovers from source ESLint's parser rejects outright. `01.5`, `0777.5`,
// `0755n` and `0_7_5_5` are all syntax errors in real JavaScript, so ESLint reports a fatal parse
// error and its rule never runs on them at all. Ours parses them anyway, which means this port has
// to decide what to do with inputs upstream has no opinion about, and the decision is invisible
// unless it is written down.
//
// The choice is to report, on the ground that the rule's subject is present in the source however
// the parser recovered. Each is pinned here so the choice is a fixture rather than an accident:
//
//	`01.5`     recovers as two literals, `01` and `.5`. The `01` is the legacy octal, and the rule
//	           reports exactly once because `.5` has no leading zero. A port that read the
//	           declaration's full text rather than the literal's own span would see `01.5` and could
//	           just as easily report twice or zero times.
//	`0777.5`   the same shape with more digits, which distinguishes a rule keying on length.
//	`0755n`    a BigInt suffix on a legacy octal, which is illegal. Our parser drops the `n` and
//	           hands back a plain `KindNumericLiteral` whose raw span is `0755`, so this reports for
//	           the same reason `0755` does. Worth pinning because the obvious expectation is that a
//	           BigInt literal arrives as `KindBigIntLiteral` and is therefore exempt, which is how
//	           `no-loss-of-precision` reaches its own BigInt exemption. That reasoning does not
//	           transfer here and the probe is what showed it.
//
// `0_7_5_5` is deliberately not in this list, and it is the case that corrected the port rather than
// the port correcting it. It was written here first, on the reasoning that a numeric separator is
// illegal in a legacy octal and our parser accepts it, so the recovered literal is still the legacy
// form and should report. The rule declined it and the fixture failed. The rule was right: the raw
// span is `0_7_5_5`, whose second character is an underscore rather than a digit, and running
// ESLint's own `/^0\d/u` against that string returns false. So declining is upstream-faithful and
// not a gap, `tsc` catches the input separately as TS6188, and the case lives in the silent list
// with the other declines. Written down because the failing fixture was the porter being wrong.
