// placeDeferredEvents moves the two event kinds whose real position the graph's hooks cannot
// express, leaving every other event in the order the graph emitted it.
//
// # The suspension
//
// An await or a yield makes every variable read BEFORE it stale, and upstream runs `makeOutdated` at
// the expression's `:exit`. The Expression hook is pre-order and it is the only hook the graph offers
// for these nodes, so the marker is emitted before the operand and has to move past it.
//
// The corpus pins both directions and they are one token apart: `foo = await foo` REPORTS, because
// the read inside the awaited operand is made stale by that very await, and `foo = await bar + foo`
// is CLEAN, because the read outside it evaluates afterwards.
//
// # The property store
//
// The graph's Write hook fires where a BINDING is stored into, and `foo.bar = x` stores into a
// property, so `foo` is only ever read there and no Write event exists. Upstream resolves the same
// asymmetry in `getWriteExpr`, walking UP from a read reference through enclosing member expressions
// to an assignment the chain is the left side of. The read is the anchor in both implementations.
//
// The store is judged once the right-hand side has evaluated, which is upstream's deferral to
// `:expression:exit`. Placing it beside the read is wrong and the corpus says so at once:
// `foo.bar += await baz` emits `R(foo) SUSPEND`, so a store next to the read is judged before the
// suspension that makes it stale, and 21 of upstream's 37 findings went silent under that placement.
//
// # Why the key is an original index plus containment, and not either alone
//
// Three keys were tried and the first two failed the corpus the same way, silence on 29 of 37
// findings, which is why the reasoning is recorded rather than the answer:
//
//	containment alone      an await's operand often emits NO events. `await amount` on an
//	                       undeclared global contributes nothing, so there is no contained event to
//	                       sit after and the suspension falls to the front of the block, ahead of
//	                       the read it was supposed to make stale.
//	a raw offset test      "starts before the await ends" also matches the assignment's own
//	                       left-hand side, which sits far to the LEFT of the operand while its store
//	                       happens to the right, so the suspension is pushed past the write instead.
//
// What is actually true is both at once: a deferral lands after every event the graph already put
// before it, and additionally after any later event that lies inside its construct. The first half
// is what the operand-with-no-events case needs, and the second is what moves a suspension past the
// reads inside its own operand.

// straight off the Read hook: the read arm and the plain-target anchor arm in

//
// **A binding declared outside this function escapes.** Its declaration lives in another scope, so
// any other function sharing that scope can write it while this one is suspended. Upstream reaches
// this through `variable.scope.variableScope !== functionScope` failing the `every`.
//
// **A binding captured by a closure escapes.** Even declared here, a nested function holding a
// reference can be called during the suspension. Upstream's `every` fails on the closure's own
// reference, whose `from.variableScope` is the closure.
//
// **A parameter escapes for the PROPERTY question only.** The object a parameter names was
// constructed by the caller and the caller still holds it, so a property write on it is observable
// outside regardless of what this function does with the binding. The binding itself is a fresh
// local slot. Upstream returns false early for exactly this pair, which is why the predicate answers
// two different things about one parameter.
//
// # How the scope question is asked here
//
// Upstream reads `variable.references` from `eslint-scope`, a resolved reference index we do not
// have. The equivalent question over the checker is asked from the declaration side instead: a
// binding whose declaration sits outside this root is reachable from outside it, and a binding
// declared inside is reachable from outside only if some occurrence of it lives in a nested root.
