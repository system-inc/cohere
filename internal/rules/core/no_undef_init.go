//	valid:   var undefined = 5; var foo = undefined;
//	valid:   class C { field = undefined; }
//	invalid: var a = undefined;
//	invalid: let a = 1, b = undefined, c = 5;
//
// # Three separate decisions, and the corpus separates them
//
// **`const` and its relatives are exempt.** Upstream's `CONSTANT_BINDINGS` is `const`, `using` and
// `await using`, and the reason is that for those three the initializer is not optional: `const foo;`
// is a syntax error, so `const foo = undefined` is the only way to write it and there is nothing to
// drop. `ast.IsVarConstLike` is that same set read off the parser rather than off a keyword string,
// and it already covers `using` and `await using` because both carry the const flag.
//
// **A shadowed `undefined` suppresses the rule.** `var undefined = 5; var foo = undefined;` is clean,
// because `foo` then holds `5` and removing the initializer would change what the program does.
// Upstream asks its scope analysis whether any binding named `undefined` has a definition; we ask
// the checker whether the identifier resolves to a symbol declared in a source file. Measured on the
// installed rule: a parameter named `undefined`, a block-scoped `let undefined`, and a file-level
// `var undefined` all suppress it, and our checker answers the same three ways.
//
// **A class field is not a variable declaration.** `class C { field = undefined; }` is clean
// upstream because the listener is `VariableDeclarator` and a property declaration is not one. That
// falls out of anchoring on the same node here rather than needing an arm.
//
// # The global `undefined` has NO declarations, which is the trap
//
// The shipped shadow test in this package, `resolvesToAGlobal` in `no_new_native_nonconstructor.go`,
// asks whether the symbol's first declaration lives in a declaration file. That is right for
// `Symbol` and `BigInt` and WRONG for this name: measured with a probe over five inputs, the real
// global `undefined` resolves to a symbol with **zero declarations**, so the shipped predicate
// answers false for it and a rule built on it would be silent on every reporting case. The question
// here is therefore the complement, asked directly: does this identifier resolve to a symbol that
// something in SOURCE declares. Zero declarations means the global, which reports.
//
// # The fixer, and its four declines
//
// Upstream returns null from the fixer in four cases, and each is a decision rather than an
// omission. `var` is excluded because `var a = undefined` and `var a` differ under hoisting once the
// declaration is reached a second time in a loop, so the edit is not meaning-preserving. A
// destructuring target is excluded because `var [a] = undefined` throws and `var [a]` does not, so
// the "repair" would delete a crash. And a comment anywhere between the binding name and the end of
// the declarator is excluded, in both directions, because the removal range would swallow it.
//
// The corpus asserts all of this: nine of the twenty-one reporting cases carry `output: null`, six
// of them purely about comment placement. `let a = undefined/* comment */;` fixes to
// `let a/* comment */;` while `let a/**/ = undefined;` does not fix at all, and the difference is
// only which side of the equals sign the comment sits on.

// "is the first declaration in a declaration file" answers false for it and any rule built on that

// file declarations, so both predicates agree for those two and only this one is right for all

//
// A declaration living in a `.d.ts` is NOT a shadow. ESLint's scope analysis is per-file and cannot

// mechanism. Reachable rather than theoretical: with a real `.d.ts` in the program the symbol
// carries one declaration, in a declaration file, and dropping this test makes the rule read it as a
// shadow and go silent.
//
// A symbol we cannot resolve answers false, which reports. That is the conservative direction for
