// Both a bare string and an array are accepted, and that is a divergence worth stating at the line.

// # Two judgments, and one input can trip both
//
// The rule asks two questions that happen to share an option. Is a designated alias holding
// something other than `this`, and is `this` being captured under a name that is not designated.
// They are separate messages and a single input can produce both: with the alias `self`,
// `var self; self = 42` reports twice, once for the declaration that never received `this` and once
// for the assignment that gave it something else. A fixture asserting one finding per input is
// wrong for it, and upstream's corpus states the pair explicitly.
//
// # Destructuring is exempt, and the exemption is the whole reason four clean cases exist
//
// `var {foo, bar} = this` and `[foo, bar] = this` capture properties of `this` rather than `this`
// itself, so no name here is an alias for the context. Upstream tests the binding form and declines
// before reading a name. A port matching on the initializer alone reports all four.
//
// # A compound assignment to the alias reports even when the value is `this`
//
// `self += this` is a finding, because the alias ends up holding a concatenation rather than the
// context. Upstream reads `node.operator !== "="` for this, and it is a real discrimination rather
// than defensive coding: the assignment's value IS a `this` expression, so a port testing only the
// value reports nothing. Measured on the installed rule, `self ||= this` reports TWICE, since the
// declaration also never received a plain assignment.
//
// # The declared-and-never-assigned half needs a scope model, and ours is measured rather than
// derived
//
// `var self` with the alias `self` reports, and `var self; self = this` does not, so the rule has to
// find whether a later plain assignment of `this` reached that declaration. Upstream asks
// eslint-scope for the variable and walks `variable.references`, requiring `reference.from === scope`
// so that a write from an inner scope does not count.
//
// We have no scope table, so this asks the same question of the tree, and what `reference.from`
// actually means here was measured against the installed rule rather than read off the source. It is
// the innermost ESLINT scope, and eslint opens one for a block, a switch, a loop body, a catch and a
// `with`, but NOT for an unbraced `if` consequent, a labeled statement, or any expression nesting.
// So all of these report, with the alias `self`:
//
//	var self; { self = this; }                  a bare block
//	var self; for(;;) { self = this; }          a loop BODY, not the loop
//	var self; while(a) { self = this; }
//	var self; switch(a){case 1: self = this;}
//	var self; try { self = this; } catch(e) {}
//	var self; with(o) self = this;
//
// while these are clean:
//
//	var self; if(a) self = this;                no block
//	var self; label: self = this;
//	var self; for(var i=0;;) self = this;       a loop with no block body
//	var self; (self = this);                    expression nesting is invisible
//	var self; a, self = this;
//	var self; a ? self = this : 0;
//
// Reproduced rather than corrected. In every reporting case above the write reaches the same VAR
// declaration and the alias does end up holding `this`, so upstream is reporting correct code, and
// the intuitive reading of the rule would call all of them clean. That intuition is the thing most
// likely to be wrong here, so it is written down beside the measurement rather than acted on.
//
// # This runs per scope, and the walk owns its own descent
//
// The declared-and-never-assigned judgment is about a whole scope rather than about one node, since
// the assignment that rescues a declaration may be written anywhere below it. The walk here is
// pre-order, so a listener on the declaration cannot see what follows. Everything therefore happens
// inside one source-file listener, which fires before its children.
