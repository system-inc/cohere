// of the nested-label inputs are prefixes of each other and an in-order walk misattributes them.

// engine's guard checks only that the rewritten file parses, none of these would be refused
// downstream; a wrong fix here is applied unattended.
//
// Each refusal was checked against a real parser rather than reasoned about:
//
//	comment    `A: /* comment */ foo` -> `foo` silently discards the comment, and where the comment
//	           sits before the colon there is no span that removes the label and keeps it.
//	directive  `A: "use strict"` -> `"use strict"` promotes the string to a directive. Confirmed
//	           with node --check: the unlabeled form rejects a duplicate parameter name that the
//	           labeled form accepts, so the rewrite changes which programs are legal.
//	ASI        `foo()\nLABEL: [1].forEach(x => x)` -> `foo()\n[1].forEach(x => x)` parses as
//	           `foo()[1]`. Confirmed with node --check: both forms parse, and they are different

// Directive position is not only the top of a file, and it is not only the innermost label.

// Both cases here were written for surviving mutants, and both guard a rewrite that parses and means

// single label at the top level, so a rule checking only the innermost label's immediate parent
// against the source file passes all of them while withholding nothing it should.
//
//	function body    A directive prologue exists at the top of a function body as well as at the top
//	                 of a file. Confirmed with node --check: `function g() { "use strict"; return
//	                 function f(a, a) { return a }; }` is rejected for the duplicate parameter, and
//	                 the same source with the string labeled is accepted. So removing the label
//	                 changes which programs are legal, exactly as it does at the top level.
//	nested labels    Only the innermost label is refused. `A: B: "use strict"` may lose `A`, because
//	                 what remains is `B: "use strict"`, still labeled and so still not a directive.
//	                 The chain never collapses into one, because the last label to go is refused on
//	                 its own pass.
//
// That second line is a correction rather than a design note. This port briefly walked through the
// label chain to the string underneath and refused the outer labels too, which withheld repairs
// upstream offers. ESLint's Linter was asked directly and fixes `A: B: 'foo'` to `B: 'foo'` and
