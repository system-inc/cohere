// NoExtraLabel flags a labeled `break` or `continue` whose label names the statement the jump would
// have reached anyway.
//
//	valid:   A: break A;
//	valid:   A: while (a) { while (b) { break A; } }
//	valid:   A: while (a) { switch (b) { case 0: break A; } }
//	invalid: A: while (a) break A;
//	invalid: A: do { break A; } while (a);
//	invalid: A: switch (a) { case 0: break A; }
//
// # The judgment is about the nearest scope, not about matching names
//
// An unlabeled `break` leaves the innermost enclosing breakable statement, which is a loop or a
// switch. So `break A` is redundant exactly when the innermost breakable statement is itself
// labeled `A`, and it is load-bearing whenever anything breakable sits between the jump and the
// label. That is why `A: while (a) { while (b) { break A; } }` is clean while
// `A: while (a) break A;` is not: the inner `while` intercepts the plain break in the first, and in
// the second nothing does.
//
// The distinction is easy to lose by matching names. A rule reporting whenever a jump's label names
// some enclosing label reports every one of upstream's fifteen passing cases, because in all of
// them the label does enclose the jump. The scope stack is the whole rule.
//
// # A labeled statement whose body is breakable contributes ONE scope, not two
//
// In `A: while (a) ...` the label and the loop are one target: an unlabeled break leaves that loop,
// and the loop is what `A` names. Upstream builds the stack so a labeled breakable statement pushes
// a single entry carrying both facts, and a labeled non-breakable statement (`A: { ... }`) pushes an
// entry that is labeled and not breakable. Pushing two entries for the labeled loop would put a
// breakable-but-unlabeled frame above the labeled one, and `A: while (a) break A;` would go silent,
// which is the exact case the rule exists for.
//
// The walk therefore reads a breakable statement's own parent to learn whether it is labeled, rather
// than the labeled statement pushing on its behalf.
//
// # A divergence our parser creates, and upstream cannot express
//
// `A: switch (a) { case 0: continue A; }` reports here and is a SYNTAX ERROR upstream, because
// `continue` may only target a loop and ESLint refuses to parse it. Our parser recovers and hands
// the rule a continue statement, so the rule judges it and finds the label redundant against the
// switch frame. The same applies to any duplicate label in one scope, which is likewise illegal.
//
// Measured rather than reasoned: driving ESLint's own Linter over these inputs returns a finding
// with a null ruleId and the message "Label 'A' is already declared" or "Unsyntactic break", which
// reads as a count of one and is not a finding at all. Four of the ten inputs in an early probe here
// were that shape, and reading only the counts would have recorded a rule level divergence that does
// not exist. Sixteen well formed inputs were then measured against the installed rule and all
// sixteen agree.
//
// # `continue` reads the same stack, and it is not a separate judgment
//
// Upstream routes `break` and `continue` through one function, and the stack it consults counts a
// switch as breakable. That is deliberate rather than sloppy: `continue` cannot target a switch, so
// a `continue A` inside a switch inside loop `A` is legal source that this rule leaves alone by
// stopping the search at the switch frame. Reproduced rather than corrected, because the alternative
// is a rule that reports a jump whose label is doing real work. Upstream's
// `A: while (a) { switch (b) { case 0: continue A; } }` is a passing case and pins it.
//
// # The fix, and the comment it refuses to destroy
//
// Removing a redundant label deletes the text between the end of the `break` or `continue` keyword
// and the end of the label, which leaves `break A;` as `break;`. Upstream withholds the repair when
// a comment sits inside that span, because the removal would silently delete it, and reports the
// finding anyway. Both halves are ported: four of upstream's nineteen failing cases carry
// `output: null` for exactly this reason, and a comment written just outside the span still fixes,
// which is what separates `break/**/ A` (declines) from `/*comment*/break A` (fixes).
//
// The span runs from the keyword's END rather than from the label's start, so a comment written
// after the label survives: upstream rewrites `continue A/*comment*/;` to `continue/*comment*/;`.
//
// The verdict at any jump depends on every enclosing statement, which the pre-order walk has not
// visited yet when the jump's own listener would fire. So the scope stack is built and read inside
// one source-file listener, which fires before its children and lets this rule own its own descent.
