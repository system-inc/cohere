		"pre-standard iteration protocol, removed from Firefox in 2015 and never implemented " +
		"anywhere else, so the property does nothing in any engine running today. Use " +

}

// NoIterator flags a property access naming `__iterator__`.
//
//	valid:   var a = test[__iterator__];
//	valid:   var __iterator__ = null;
//	valid:   foo[`__iterator`] = null;
//	invalid: var a = test.__iterator__;
//	invalid: var a = test['__iterator__'];
//	invalid: var a = test[`__iterator__`];
//
// The three valid cases are the whole discrimination and each fails a different way if the rule is
// written as a text match. `test[__iterator__]` is a computed access through a *variable* of that
// name, which is a different property entirely and may not be a string at all. A declaration binding
// the name is not a property access. And a template literal whose text merely resembles it,
// including one carrying a newline, is a different key.
//
// # Static property name is the predicate, not the spelling
//
// Upstream asks the member expression for its static property name, which answers for the dotted
// form, a string-literal subscript, and a template literal with no substitutions alike, and answers
// nothing for a computed access whose key is an expression. That is the same question this asks, and
// writing it as "does the source text contain __iterator__" would report all three valid cases.
//
// A template literal with substitutions has no static name even when its cooked text would match,
// because the value is not known until it runs.
//
// # The suggestion, and why it is not a fix
//
// Replacing `.__iterator__` with `[Symbol.iterator]` preserves meaning only if the author meant the
// iteration protocol, and that is an inference about intent rather than a mechanical equivalence: a
// codebase that defined its own `__iterator__` property gets a different property under the same
// name. So it is offered as a suggestion a human chooses rather than applied unattended.
//
// The replaced span runs from the end of the object expression to the end of the member expression,
// which is what deletes the dot in `test.__iterator__` and the brackets in `test['__iterator__']`
// without either case needing its own arm.

// no-substitution template all resolve, while a computed access through a variable does not. That is
// what makes `test[__iterator__]` a pass case rather than a missed finding, and writing a second
// spelling of it here would have been the drift the shelf guard exists to refuse.
//
// It is broader than this rule needs in one way, accepting a numeric-literal subscript, which is
