//
// The distinction is forced by the graph rather than chosen. `controlflow`'s Read hook fires for
// every identifier assignment target, plain ones included: `patternReads` calls `b.read(node)` on a
// `KindIdentifier` target before the assigned expression, because ESLint counts naming the target as
// a point where an enclosing `try` can throw. Measured directly — `let v = 'a'; f(v); v = 'dead';`
// emits `R(v@3) W(v@3) R(f@12) R(v@15) R(v@18) W(v@18)`, and the `R(v@18)` is the dead store's own
// target, not a read of it. Trusting the hook would make every write trivially live and the rule
// would report nothing at all.
//
// So the hook says where in the flow an occurrence sits, and the AST says what it is. Both are
// needed: the AST alone cannot order two occurrences across a branch, and the hook alone cannot tell
// a store from a load.

// antecedent chain passed back through the candidate write. That is the same predicate and it works,
// but it pays for the inversion in three places the graph now answers directly: an update expression
// and a destructuring target have no flow node lining up with a single-identifier reachability
// question, and a function body starts a fresh flow graph with no antecedent path to the enclosing
// writes at all.
//
