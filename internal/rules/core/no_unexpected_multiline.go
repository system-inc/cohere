//
// # What the rule is actually about
//
// Automatic semicolon insertion does not fire before `(`, `[`, a backtick, or `/`. Each of those
// four continues the previous line instead of starting a new one, so source laid out as two
// statements is one expression. That is the whole subject, and it is why this is a correctness rule
// rather than a formatting preference: no formatter can express the difference, because both
// readings are the same characters.
//
// # Four judgments, one shared test
//
// Every arm asks the same question in the end. Take the expression on the left, find the token that
// opens what follows it, and compare their lines. Upstream shares this as `checkForBreakAfter` and
// so does this port.
//
// # Where our parser makes upstream's paren skip unnecessary
//
// Upstream calls `getTokenAfter(node, astUtils.isNotClosingParenToken)`, and that filter is
// load-bearing for it: its parser folds `ParenthesizedExpression` away, so for
// `var a = (a || b)\n(x || y).doSomething()` the callee node ends at `b` and the very next token is
// the `)` that closes the parenthesis rather than the `(` that opens the call. It has to walk past
// the closers to reach the token the rule is about.
//
// Our parser keeps `KindParenthesizedExpression` as a real node whose End() is after its own
// closing paren, so `Expression.End()` already sits past every closer and `SkipTrivia` from there
// lands on the open token directly. Measured across the four parenthesized cases in upstream's
// corpus, and the skip has nothing to do: the port would produce the same answer with the filter
// and cannot express it without one.
//
// This is the parenthesis hazard running the other way for once. The usual failure is a port seeing
// a node upstream deleted; here the extra node removes a step rather than adding one.
//
// # Why no unwrap loop
//
// Nothing in this rule walks THROUGH an expression to reason about what is inside it. Every arm
// reads a boundary, where one node ends and a token begins, and a parenthesis is part of that
// boundary rather than something to see past. Unwrapping would move the boundary to the wrong place
// and report `var a = (a || b)\n(x).doSomething()` at the paren rather than the call.
//
// # The division arm, and the stale flag list it carries
//
// The shape is a `/` binary whose LEFT child is also a `/` binary, which is how `foo / bar /gym`
// parses. If the token after the second slash is an identifier that is entirely regular expression
// flags AND is adjacent to the slash with no space, the line reads as `foo` followed by a regular
// expression literal rather than as two divisions.
//
// Upstream matches flags with `/^[gimsuy]+$/u`, which predates both `d` (hasIndices, ES2022) and
// `v` (unicodeSets, ES2024). Measured against the installed build at 10.8.1:
//
//	foo\n/bar/g     REPORTS
//	foo\n/bar/s     REPORTS
//	foo\n/bar/d     clean
//	foo\n/bar/v     clean
//
// So `d` and `v` are missed, and the miss is upstream's rather than this port's. Reproduced rather
// than corrected: a port that silently improves on its original is a divergence nobody can see, and
// widening the set here would report inputs the tool being compared against calls clean.
//
// The adjacency test is not decoration either. `foo\n/ bar / g` is clean because the space means
// the `g` cannot be a flag, and `foo\n/ bar /GYM` is clean because the flag set is case sensitive.
// Both are in the corpus.
//
// # What the arms decline, and why each decline is a case rather than an oversight
//
//	a call with no arguments      `b\n()` invokes nothing, so nothing was misread as a statement
//	an optional call or access    `b?.\n(x)` cannot be an accident: the `?.` is explicit
//	a non-computed member         `b\n.x` is unambiguous, a leading dot cannot start a statement
//	a NewExpression               upstream listens on CallExpression alone, and `new b\n(x)` is
//	                              clean against the installed build
//
// # Type arguments, which our parser sees and upstream's default parser cannot
//
// `var a = foo<T>\n(x)` parses here as a call with type arguments, and `Expression.End()` is before
// the `<`. SkipTrivia lands on the `<`, which is on the callee's own line, so the arm declines.
// That is the same answer upstream gives under the TypeScript parser, measured, where
// `getTokenAfter` also returns the `<`. The agreement is worth stating because it is a coincidence
// of two different routes rather than a shared implementation.
