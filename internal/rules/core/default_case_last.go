	Description: "This `default` clause is not the last one in its `switch`. A reader scanning " +
		"the clauses in order expects the fallback at the bottom, and a `default` sitting in the " +
		"middle also falls through into whatever case follows it when its body has no `break`, " +
		"which is a control flow almost nobody writes on purpose. Move it to the end.",
}

// DefaultCaseLast flags a `switch` whose `default` clause is not written last.
//
//	valid:   switch (foo) { case 1: break; default: break; }
//	valid:   switch (foo) { default: }
//	valid:   switch (foo) { case 1: case 2: default: }
//	invalid: switch (foo) { default: break; case 1: break; }
//	invalid: switch (foo) { case 1: default: case 2: break; }
//
// # Position is the entire judgment, and a body is not part of it
//
// Upstream finds the index of the clause with no test and compares it against the last index. It
// never looks inside a clause, so an empty `default:` sitting last is clean and a `default:` with a
// full body sitting second-to-last reports. Twelve of the twenty-three clean cases in the corpus
// exist to pin that: they vary the bodies, the break statements and the number of neighbouring
// cases while keeping the position legal, and every one of them would still be clean if the rule
// read no body at all.
//
// The corpus also carries `switch (foo) { case 1: default: }`, where `default` is last while sharing
// a fallthrough group with `case 1`. Upstream reports on index rather than on grouping, so that is
// clean, and a port reasoning about fallthrough groups instead of about clause order would report
// it.
//
// # Why this anchors on the switch rather than on the clause
//
// A `KindDefaultClause` listener would fire on the right node and could not answer the question:
// deciding whether it is last needs the sibling list, which means climbing back to the case block
// anyway. Anchoring on the statement reads the clause list once and asks the only question there
// is.
//
// # The reported span is the default clause, not the switch
//
// Upstream passes `node: defaultClause`, and its corpus asserts the column of the `default` keyword
// on all fourteen reporting cases rather than the column of `switch`. A port reporting the whole
// statement satisfies every message-id assertion and points the reader at the wrong line in a long
// switch, which is exactly the case where the finding is worth having.
