//
// # What it is for, and why the default is Start
//
// A `TODO` is a note to a future reader that the code is knowingly incomplete, and the rule exists
// so those notes are counted rather than accumulating unread. Matching only at the START of a
// comment is deliberate: a comment whose first word is `TODO` is a marker, while one that merely
// mentions the word in prose is usually describing something rather than deferring it.
//
// # The comment VALUE, not its source text
//
// Upstream matches against `node.value`, which is the comment body with the delimiters removed and
// nothing else stripped. That is the whole reason `/** TODO */` is clean by default while
// `/* TODO */` reports: the surviving asterisk sits between the anchor and the term. Our comment
// reader hands back the full source text including delimiters, so they are removed here, and
// getting that wrong in either direction moves a whole class of comment across the line.
//
// # Word boundaries, which are ASCII on both sides
//
// The term is bounded by `\b` on whichever side starts or ends with a word character, so `fixed`
// and `affix` do not match `fix`, while a term written `!FIX` is unbounded on its left. Go's `\b`
// is ASCII-only and JavaScript's is too even under the `u` flag, which was measured rather than
// assumed across six non-ASCII shapes: both agree that `ÜTODO`, `TODOé` and `日TODO` match while
// `ТODO` spelled with a Cyrillic Te does not.
//
// # The message quotes the comment, truncated on a word boundary
//
// Upstream rebuilds the quoted text word by word and stops before exceeding forty characters,
// appending an ellipsis when it stopped early. So the quote never splits a word, and a comment whose
// FIRST word already exceeds the limit quotes as nothing but the ellipsis. Reproduced exactly,
// because the quoted text is the part of the message a reader scans.
