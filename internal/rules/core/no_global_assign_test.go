// A real path, because this rule reads the checker: the harness builds an actual program and the

// Every case below is verbatim from `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/eslint/no_global_assign.rs`:
// one Tester block, 8 pass and 8 fail. The extractor reported 9 diagnostics from those 8 fail
// inputs, so one finding per input is wrong here. The extra one belongs to
// `({Object = 0, String = 0} = {});`, which writes two different names and reports twice.
//
// # Which upstream cases this port can carry, and which it cannot
//
// Upstream answers "is this name a read-only global" from a vendored `javascript_globals` table
// keyed by an `env` config (`browser`, `node`) plus a user `globals` map. Neither the table nor
// either config surface exists in this tree, and five of upstream's sixteen cases turn on nothing
// else. Those five are listed in `TestNoGlobalAssignBoundary` below with what each would need,
// rather than deleted, so the gap is a stated divergence and not a silent one.
//
// This port answers the same question from the TypeScript standard library instead: a name declared
// in a declaration file is a global, a name declared in source is a shadow. That covers every
// builtin upstream's `GLOBALS_BUILTIN` covers and nothing that depends on an `env`.
