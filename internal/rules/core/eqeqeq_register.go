// The decoder is hand-rolled so an unknown mode or null policy fails loudly. Every arm of this rule
// is selected by string equality, so `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` leaving an unrecognized string in the
// field would pick a silent fourth behaviour of reporting nothing rather than producing an error.
// The same function is also where upstream's mode-dependent default lives: the null policy defaults
// to Always under the Always mode and is forced to Ignore under Smart.
