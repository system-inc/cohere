// The span, which the message-id fixtures above structurally cannot see.

// This is the whole risk in this rule. Both upstream implementations deliberately report the `with`
// keyword alone and not the statement: oxc writes `Span::sized(with_statement.span.start, 4)` and
// ESLint writes `loc: sourceCode.getFirstToken(node).loc`. The snapshot agrees, underlining four
// columns. Our obvious spelling, `ctx.ReportNode(node, ...)`, spans the entire statement instead,
// and a probe confirmed it: `with(foo) { bar() }` reported [0,19) rather than [0,4). That port would
// have passed every fixture above while pointing at the wrong text, which is the defect this step
// exists to catch. The rule carries no fix, so nothing else would have surfaced it either.

// The rule stays live under strict mode, which is the question worth answering here.
//
// `with` is a syntax error in strict mode and every ES module is strict, so the reasonable
// expectation is that this rule can never fire on our tree and is dead weight. That expectation is
// wrong, and a probe is what settled it rather than the reasoning. TypeScript's parser is
// error-tolerant: it builds a real WithStatement node and raises the strict-mode violation as a
// grammar diagnostic during checking instead of refusing to parse. So the node reaches a linter
// walking the AST in every context, including an explicit `'use strict'` and a genuine module.
//
// The rule is therefore redundant with the type checker rather than inert, which is what upstream's
// own note means by "not necessary in TypeScript code if `alwaysStrict` is enabled". This pins the
// behavior so that a later parser change making `with` unparseable fails here loudly rather than
// silently turning every fixture above vacuous.
