// ConstructorSuper requires a derived class constructor to call `super()` on every path, and
// forbids a `super()` call where there is no constructable superclass to call.
//
// The failure is a runtime one and it is total. A derived constructor that returns without calling
// `super()` throws a ReferenceError on every construction, and `super()` in a class that extends
// nothing is a syntax error the file will not even load with. Neither is a style question.
//
// Examples of incorrect code:
//
//	class A extends B { constructor() { } }
//	class A extends B { constructor() { if (a) super(); } }
//	class A extends B { constructor() { super(); super(); } }
//	class A extends null { constructor() { super(); } }
//
// Examples of correct code:
//
//	class A extends B { constructor() { super(); } }
//	class A extends B { constructor() { if (a) super(); else super(); } }
//	class A { constructor() { } }
//	class A extends null { constructor() { return a; } }
//
// # Four judgments, and which one an input lands in is the whole rule
//
// Upstream names them and this reproduces the names, because they are genuinely different findings
// rather than one finding with four wordings:
//
//	missingAll    a derived constructor with no reachable `super()` anywhere
//	missingSome   `super()` on some paths out of the constructor and not others
//	duplicate     a `super()` reachable on a path that has already called one
//	badSuper      a `super()` where the superclass cannot be constructed
//
// `missingAll` and `missingSome` anchor on the constructor, since the fix is to add a call and
// there is no single place the caret belongs. `duplicate` and `badSuper` anchor on the offending
// call, since there is one and it is the thing to delete.
//
// # There is no control flow graph here, and this is the third rule to establish that
//
// Upstream builds a real dataflow analysis on oxc's control flow graph: a five-state lattice
// (`Unreached`, `Never`, `Once`, `Multiple`, `Mixed`), a worklist over basic blocks, a join at
// every merge point, and special handling for back edges and explicit error edges. We have no such
// graph. TypeScript's flow graph is not a substitute and that has now been measured independently
// three times, by `getter-return`, by `no-this-before-super`, and here: `ast.FlowNode` carries
// `Antecedent` and `Antecedents` and no successor edges at all, because it exists for *narrowing*
// and is keyed on the expression positions where a type could change. There is no `super()`
// instruction in it to find, and no return or throw instruction either.
//
// So the analysis is structural, over the statement tree. The shape transferred from
// `getter-return` almost intact, which is worth saying precisely because it is the second time it
// has held:
//
//	an if merges its arms, and an arm that exits acceptably drops out of the merge
//	a try's finally overrides, and a catch means the try's own result is not guaranteed
//	a switch needs a default and every non-empty clause to agree
//	loops never establish anything, because the body may run zero times
//
// Where it did *not* transfer is the reason this rule needed a lattice rather than a boolean.
// `getter-return` asks a yes-or-no question ("does every path return") and a boolean answers it.
// This rule needs three values, because `super()` on *some* paths is a distinct finding from
// `super()` on *no* paths, and a boolean collapses exactly that distinction. `superSometimes` is
// the state that carries it, and it is why `combineBranches` is a real join rather than an `&&`.
//
// The second thing that did not transfer is the exit rule. `getter-return` treats every exit alike,
// because a `throw` and a `return x` both mean the getter did not fall off its end. Here they are
// the same as each other but different from a bare `return`, and the difference is the whole of two
// corpus pairs. A `throw` or a `return <expression>` is an *acceptable* exit: the constructor never
// completes normally, so the missing `super()` on that path cannot be observed, and upstream drops
// the path from the merge. A bare `return;` is not acceptable: it completes the constructor and
// yields an object whose `this` was never bound. Upstream's `is_acceptable_exit` reads exactly
// `Throw | Return(NotImplicitUndefined)`, and ESLint reaches the same place from the other
// direction with a `ReturnStatement` handler whose comment says a returned argument is a substitute
// for `super()`. Both are reproduced by `acceptableExit`.
//
// # Where the two upstreams disagree, and which one is reproduced
//
// The corpus was run through the real ESLint rule rather than read, and the two implementations
// agree on *whether* every one of the 87 inputs fires. They disagree on the message id for six of
// the 43 fail inputs, all involving a loop or a short circuit. The verdicts reproduced here are
// oxc's, because oxc's snapshot is the artifact that pins this port and choosing otherwise would
// make the imported corpus unable to check it.
//
// One of those six is an oxc defect rather than a judgment call, and it is reproduced knowingly.
// `class A extends B { constructor() { a && super(); } }` reports `missingAll` upstream and
// `missingSome` in ESLint, and ESLint is right: the `super()` is reachable whenever `a` is truthy,
// so it is on some paths rather than none. Oxc lands on `missingAll` because its control flow graph
// does not record the short-circuited right operand at all, so its `super_call_counts` map comes
// back empty and the first branch of its match fires. The finding is correct and only its wording
// is wrong, which is why it is reproduced rather than quietly improved on.
//
// # The classifier is ESLint's, and that is the one deliberate divergence
//
// Deciding whether `extends <expression>` names something constructable is a separate question from
// the path analysis, and the two upstreams solve it in opposite directions. Oxc writes a blacklist:
// `is_invalid_super_class` returns true for a numeric, string, boolean or bigint literal and for a
// binary expression, and false for everything else, so anything unrecognised is assumed
// constructable. ESLint writes a whitelist: `isPossibleConstructor` returns true for the ten node
// kinds that can hold a constructor and false for everything else.
//
// They agree on all 87 corpus inputs, which is why the corpus cannot separate them. They diverge on
// inputs the corpus does not contain, and every divergence is oxc missing a real defect:
//
//	class A extends undefined { constructor() { super(); } }
//	class A extends [] { constructor() { super(); } }
//	class A extends ({}) { constructor() { super(); } }
//	class A extends `x` { constructor() { super(); } }
//	class A extends /re/ { constructor() { super(); } }
//	class A extends (void 0) { constructor() { super(); } }
//
// Each of those is provably not a constructor and each is `badSuper` in ESLint and clean in oxc.
// The whitelist is used here. It is the stronger instrument, it costs nothing, and it agrees with
// oxc everywhere oxc has an opinion the corpus records. Six invented fixtures pin the divergence so
// a later reader can see it was a decision.
