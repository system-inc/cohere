// NoLonelyIf flags an `if` that is the only statement inside an `else` block.
//
//	valid:   if (a) {;} else if (b) {;}
//	valid:   if (a) {;} else { if (b) {;} ; }
//	valid:   if (a) if (a) {} else { if (b) {} } else {}
//	invalid: if (a) {;} else { if (b) {;} }
//	invalid: if (foo) {} else { if (bar) baz(); }
//
// # The shape being matched
//
// An `if` whose parent is a block, where that block holds exactly one statement, and where the
// block is the ELSE branch of an enclosing `if`. The last test is identity against the enclosing
// statement's else branch rather than a kind test, because the then branch of an `if` is a block
// holding one `if` just as often and is not this rule's subject.
//
// # The third clean case is a dangling-else guard, and it is the whole of upstream's helper
//
// `if (a) if (a) {} else { if (b) {} } else {}` is clean, and nothing about "one statement in an
// else block" explains that. The braces are load-bearing: remove them and the trailing `else {}`
// would bind to the inner `if (b)` rather than to the outer one, which is a different program.
// Upstream calls `astUtils.areBracesNecessary` for this, and the part that fires here is
// `hasUnsafeIf(statement) && isFollowedByElseKeyword(node)`.
//
// The other half of that helper, `isLexicalDeclaration`, cannot fire from this rule at all: the
// statement being tested is the block's only statement AND this listener already knows it is an
// `if`, so it is never a `let`, `const`, `using`, function or class declaration. It is left out
// rather than transcribed, and the reasoning is here so the omission does not read as a gap.
//
// `hasUnsafeIf` is recursive and the recursion is load-bearing. It asks whether the code would end
// with an `if` that has no `else` of its own, following the alternate chain down and stepping
// through loop and label bodies, which are the constructs whose body a dangling `else` can reach
// through. Measured against the installed build at 10.8.1:
//
//	if (a) if (a) {} else { if (b) {} } else {}                clean, the inner if has no else
//	if (a) if (a) {} else { if (b) {} }                        REPORTS, nothing follows to bind
//	if (a) if (a) {} else { if (b) {} else {} } else {}        REPORTS, the chain ends with an else
//	if (a) if (a) {} else { if (b) {} else if (c) {} } else {} clean, the chain ends without one
//
// The third of those produces broken output when upstream fixes it, which is upstream's own defect
// and is reproduced rather than corrected, because a port that silently improves on the original
// is a divergence nobody can see.
//
// # The fixer, and the five things it refuses
//
// Upstream declares `fixable: "code"` and rewrites the else block to `else if`, replacing the
// braces with the inner statement's own text. The corpus asserts the output text on ten cases and
// declines on five, and those declines are the port rather than a detail:
//
//	a comment before the inner if      the text between `{` and the `if` is not just whitespace,
//	                                   so removing the braces would drop it
//	a comment after the inner if       same, on the other side
//	the fix would create a syntax
//	  error or change meaning by
//	  automatic semicolon insertion    three separate shapes, all where the inner consequent has
//	                                   no braces and no terminating semicolon
//
// The semicolon-insertion group is the subtle one, and each shape is in the corpus. An unbraced
// consequent whose statement is not terminated joins the line after it: `baz()` followed by
// `qux();` on the same line becomes one call, `baz()` followed by a line opening `[` becomes a
// subscript, and `baz++` followed by anything becomes an operand. The same sources WITH a semicolon
// are fixed, and both spellings are in the corpus for the comparison.
//
// A wrong fix here is worse than no fix, because the engine's only guard is that the result parses
// and every one of these parses. So the finding still fires in all five and only the repair is
// withheld, which is upstream's own trade.
