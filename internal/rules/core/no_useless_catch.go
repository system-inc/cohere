// NoUselessCatch flags a `catch` whose first statement rethrows the error it caught.

//	valid:   try { f(); } catch (error) { log(error); }
//	valid:   try { f(); } catch (error) { cleanup(); throw error; }
//	valid:   try { f(); } catch (error) { throw new WrappedError(error); }
//	valid:   try { f(); } finally { cleanup(); }
//	invalid: try { f(); } catch (error) { throw error; }
//
// Catching an error and immediately rethrowing it leaves runtime behavior exactly as it was without
// the `try`. The cost is not the wasted frames, it is the reading: the shape says an error is being
// handled here, so anyone tracing where a failure goes has to stop and confirm that it isn't.
//
// Which node is reported depends on `finally`, and the distinction is the repair rather than the
// diagnosis. Without a `finally` the entire `try` is doing nothing, so the whole statement is
// reported and the repair is to unwrap it. With a `finally` the `try` still has work to do, so only
// the `catch` clause is reported and the repair keeps `try`/`finally` intact. Two messages, because
// one message that named the wrong repair would be worse than no message.
//
// Only the first statement is examined, which is ESLint's rule and not a shortcut. A rethrow in
// first position makes every statement after it unreachable, so the clause is useless whatever else
// it contains; a rethrow after other statements means the clause did something first and is doing
// real work.
//
// A destructured binding is exempt: `catch ({ message }) { throw message; }` rethrows a property
// rather than the error, which is a different value and a different behavior. So is a bare `catch`
// with no binding, which has nothing to name and so cannot be rethrowing what it caught.
//
// Where TypeScript adds shapes ESLint has no view on, we follow what survives compilation. `throw
// (error)` is reported, since parentheses are grouping and ESTree does not even keep them. `throw
// error!` and `throw error as Error` are reported too: both are erased before anything runs, so the
// thrown value is the caught binding unchanged and the clause is exactly as useless. rslint treats
// those last two as valid, on the reading that the wrapper makes it not a plain rethrow. We diverge
// deliberately, because ESLint's rule is about what the code does at runtime and at runtime there is
// no wrapper.
//
// No fix. Removing a `try` is a structural edit whose correct form depends on what the author meant
// the clause to become.
