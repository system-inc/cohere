// # Only a string or a number literal can lose its brackets
//
// A non-computed key may be an identifier, a number literal or a string literal, so those are the
// only values whose brackets are removable. Upstream reads `key.type !== "Literal"` and then
// `typeof value !== "number" && typeof value !== "string"`, which declines a template literal, a
// regular expression, `null`, a boolean, and -- deliberately -- a bigint. The bigint decline is
// upstream telling us what it knowingly misses, with a comment saying well-known browsers throw a
// syntax error on a bigint property name, so the rule leaves those alone "for now". Reproduced
// rather than improved on: `({ [99999999999999999n]: 0 })` is one of upstream's clean cases.
//
// A no-substitution template is a second decline worth naming, because our parser gives it its own
// kind and the shelf's `property.Name` accepts it. Upstream's ESTree calls it a `TemplateLiteral`
// rather than a `Literal`, so `({ [`+"`"+`x`+"`"+`]: 0 })` is clean. This port declines it by listing the two
// accepted kinds rather than by excluding kinds, so a kind nobody thought about is declined by
// default rather than accepted by default.
//
// # The four reserved names, and why they differ by position
//
// Dropping brackets is only safe when the resulting non-computed key means the same thing, and four
// names change meaning when they lose their brackets:
//
//	{ ['__proto__']: foo }             defines a property; { '__proto__': foo } sets the prototype
//	class C { ['constructor'] }        an instance field; class C { 'constructor' } fails to parse
//	class C { static ['constructor'] } a static field; the plain form fails to parse
//	class C { static ['prototype'] }   a runtime error; the plain form fails to PARSE
//	class C { ['constructor']() {} }   a prototype method; the plain form IS the constructor
//	class C { static ['prototype']() {} } a runtime error; the plain form fails to parse
//
// So the exempt name depends on both the member kind and whether it is static, and the `__proto__`
// exemption applies only inside an object EXPRESSION. In a destructuring pattern there is no
// prototype to set, which is why `var { ['__proto__']: a } = obj` reports while
// `({ ['__proto__']: [] })` does not. That pair is the whole reason upstream checks the parent kind
// rather than just the name.
//
// # What TypeScript adds, measured against the installed rule rather than reasoned about
//
// Three TypeScript member shapes carry a computed key and are SILENT upstream, and in every case the
// mechanism is that typescript-eslint gives them their own ESTree node type which upstream's
// `create` never listens on:
//
//	interface I { ['x']: number }      TSPropertySignature      silent
//	type T = { ['x']: number }         TSPropertySignature      silent
//	abstract class C { abstract ['x'](): void }   TSAbstractMethodDefinition   silent
//	class C { accessor ['x'] = 1 }     AccessorProperty         silent
//
// Each was measured by driving the installed rule with the typescript-eslint parser, alongside a
// control in the same file that does report, so the zero is an absence of a listener rather than a
// parse failure. Reproduced here by listing the member kinds this rule visits rather than by
// visiting every node with a computed name.
//
// An enum member cannot carry a computed key at all -- TypeScript rejects it as a parse error --
// so `KindEnumMember` is unreachable rather than declined, and it is absent from the visited set
// for the same reason.
//
// Every other TypeScript decoration around the key is reported and fixed, because none of it lives
// inside the brackets: `?`, `!`, `declare`, `readonly`, `static`, `override`, an access modifier, a
// decorator, a type annotation, type parameters, and a `satisfies` on the enclosing object all
// survive the repair untouched. That is the load-bearing fact about this fixer and it is the reason
// the repair is shipped rather than declined; see the fixer's own comment.
