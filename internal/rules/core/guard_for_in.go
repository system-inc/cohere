	Description: "This `for-in` loop visits inherited properties as well as the object's own. " +
		"`for-in` walks the whole prototype chain, so anything added to `Object.prototype` by a " +
		"library, a polyfill, or older code shows up as another iteration, and the body runs on a " +
		"key the object never declared. The usual symptom is a serializer emitting a phantom " +
		"field or a counter that is one too high, on a machine where some other package loaded " +
		"first. Guard the body with `if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, key))`, or use " +
		"`Object.keys(o)`, which returns own enumerable keys and needs no guard.",
}

// GuardForIn flags a `for-in` loop whose body does not begin with a filter.

//	valid:   for (var x in o);

//
// # The predicate is structural, and deliberately shallow
//
// Upstream does not ask whether the body actually calls `hasOwnProperty`; it asks whether the body
// has the SHAPE of a guarded loop. Any `if` will do, whatever it tests. That is a real decision
// rather than an approximation, and reproducing it means not improving on it: a rule checking for a
// `hasOwnProperty` call specifically would report every loop guarded by `if (!o[k]) continue;` or
// by a type test, which upstream accepts.
//
// Five shapes exempt, and the ordering below is upstream's:
//
//	an empty statement body      nothing runs, so nothing runs unguarded
//	an `if` as the whole body    the guard is the body
//	an empty block               same as the empty statement, wearing braces
//	a block holding only an `if` the same guard, wearing braces
//	a block STARTING with an `if` whose consequent is exactly one `continue`
//
// The fifth is the early-exit idiom and it is the only one that inspects the `if`'s consequent. The
// reason it must is visible in the first two failing cases:
//
//	for (var x in o) { if (x) { f(); continue; } g(); }
//	for (var x in o) { if (x) { continue; f(); } g(); }
//
// Both hold a `continue` inside the leading `if`, and neither is the idiom, because `f()` runs on
// the unfiltered key in the first and the block is not a bare skip in the second. Upstream requires
// the consequent to be a `continue` outright, or a block whose ONLY statement is a `continue`, and
// a port testing "does the consequent contain a continue" reports neither of these two while
// upstream reports both.
//
// Note the asymmetry the corpus pins: the fourth exemption accepts a block whose only statement is
// an `if` with ANY consequent, while the fifth accepts a longer block only when the leading `if`
// skips. `{ if (x) { f(); } }` is clean and `{ if (x) { f(); } g(); }` reports, and the difference
// is entirely the trailing `g()`.
//
// No fix. The repair is a guard, and which guard depends on what the loop meant: `hasOwnProperty`,
// a key filter, or a rewrite to `Object.keys`. The rule cannot know which, and each changes what
// the loop does.
