//
// Hand-rolled rather than `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` because the wire value is polymorphic and the
// default is not the zero value. Three things have to be right and none of them falls out of a
// struct tag:
//
// The value may be a bare INTEGER. cohere's config layer strips the severity tuple, so a config
// writing `["error", 2]` hands this the JSON `2`, which no struct can unmarshal.
//
// An ABSENT value must mean 1 rather than 0. The generic helper errors on empty input and the config
// layer turns that into nil, which a plain int field would read as 0, a maximum of zero, reporting
// every file with a single class in it. That is the live config's own shape for a rule configured as
// a bare severity, so it is the ordinary path rather than a corner.
//
// An object with no `max` must also mean 1. Upstream writes `option.max || 1`, so `{}` and
// `{ignoreExpressions: true}` both leave the limit at one, measured against the installed build at
// 10.8.1 rather than read off the source.
//
// A maximum below 1 is refused, which is upstream's `minimum: 1` in the schema. Measured: eslint
// rejects both `0` and `{max: 0}` at configuration load rather than at lint time, so refusing here
// is the same decision arriving through the only surface this port has.

// # Every class in the file counts, wherever it is written
//
// Upstream hooks the two class node kinds and nothing else, so the count is over the whole file
// rather than over its top level. Measured against the installed build at 10.8.1, each of these
// reports: a class nested inside another class's method body, a class inside a function, two
// exported classes, and a class expression passed straight to a call. The corpus writes none of
// those shapes, so a port counting only top-level statements passes every imported case and then
// goes silent on the file that actually has five classes buried in it.
//
// A class EXPRESSION counts too, and that is the half `ignoreExpressions` exists to turn off. The
// option drops expressions from the count while leaving declarations, rather than lowering the
// limit.
//
// # Where the finding points, which is not the node it is reported on
//
// Upstream reports on the program while overriding the location to span the program's BODY: the
// start of the first statement to the end of the last. The difference is trivia. A file opening with
// a comment has a program starting at position zero and a first statement starting after the
// comment, and upstream's own last corpus case pins that distinction by asserting line 2 column 1
// for a file whose first line is `/* comment */`.
//
// `rule.TokenRange` on the first statement is the same span, and it was checked against all three
// shapes upstream asserts rather than assumed: a plain two-class file, a comment-wrapped one, and an
// indented one inside a template. All three reproduce upstream's line and column exactly.
//
// An empty file cannot report, since a file with no statements has no classes and therefore never
// exceeds a limit of at least one. That is measured rather than argued, and the measurement is
// recorded at the indexing site below, which is why the body span carries no length guard.
//
// # No fixer, matching upstream
//
// Upstream declares none, and the repair is a human decision: which class moves, to which file, and
// what the new file is called. The audit measured 18 sites in this tree for exactly that reason.
