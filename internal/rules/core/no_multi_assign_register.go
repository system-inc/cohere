// The decoder is hand-rolled rather than `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` for the reason written above it:
// the generic helper errors on empty input and the config layer turns that error into nil, which the
// rule then reads as a zero value. That is the correct answer for this rule's one option today,
// because it defaults to false, and the explicit path is written anyway so a later default change
// cannot invert the rule without anything saying so.
