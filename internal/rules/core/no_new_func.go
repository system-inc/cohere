//
// # Three ways to reach the constructor, and upstream catches all three
//
// `new Function(...)` and `Function(...)` are the same thing, since the constructor ignores whether
// it was invoked with `new`. The third is indirect: `apply`, `bind` and `call` on `Function` itself
// invoke it too, so `Function.call(null, 'return 1')` compiles a function. Upstream enumerates
// exactly those three method names and this reproduces the set rather than generalising it.
// `Function.toString()` is a clean case upstream, and it would report under any looser reading.
//
// # Where the finding points, measured rather than inferred
//
// The report is on the invoking expression, which for the indirect form is the `apply`/`bind`/`call`
// call and NOT the outer call it may be part of. Measured on eslint 10.8.1:
//
//	Function.bind(null, "b")()    reports columns 1 through 20, which ends at the bind call's
//	                              closing paren rather than at the trailing ()
//	Function.bind(null, "b")      reports the same span, uncalled
//	Function.bind                 clean, because nothing invoked it
//
// The uncalled `Function.bind(...)` reporting is the tell that the anchor is the method call itself:
// the value is a function that will compile a string whenever it is eventually called, so upstream
// reports at the point the constructor was bound.
//
// # The shadow question, and why this reads the checker
//
// Half of upstream's clean cases are a local binding named `Function`, and there is no structural
// answer: the shadow can be a class, a function declaration, a parameter, or a `var` in any
// enclosing scope. Upstream asks its scope analysis for the global `Function` variable and then
// walks that variable's own references, so a shadowed name never enters the loop.
//
// `resolvesToAGlobal`, shipped for `no-new-native-nonconstructor` and shared with three other rules
// here, asks the equivalent question of the checker: a global is declared in the standard library,
// which is a declaration file, while any binding written in source is a shadow. Probed against all
// thirteen of upstream's clean cases and all ten reporting ones before this was written, and the two
// agreed on every row. The row that matters most is the nested one:
//
//	class Function {}; new Function()                        silent, the class shadows
//	const fn = () => { class Function {} }; new Function()   reports, the class is in an inner scope
//
// A name-only test reports the first; a test that gives up whenever the name is declared anywhere in
// the file is silent on the second. Only resolution separates them, and both are upstream cases.
//
// Upstream additionally requires `variable.defs.length === 0`, which excludes a global that source
// redeclares. That is the same judgment from the other side and `resolvesToAGlobal` answers it
// alike, since a redeclaration in source puts a non-declaration-file declaration on the symbol.
