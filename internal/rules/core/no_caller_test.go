// no fixture. Upstream reports the property span specifically, and the difference is not cosmetic:
// a finding anchored at the start of the access sits one token earlier, and on a wrapped expression
// that can be a different line from the one an author would suppress.

// Asserted against the source text the range covers, rather than against offsets, because an offset
