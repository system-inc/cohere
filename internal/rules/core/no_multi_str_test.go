// tested nothing.

// The cases below are ours. Each exists because reading our own code or driving the installed

// TestNoMultiStrJsxExemption is the case the imported corpus cannot make.
//
// Upstream declines when the literal's parent type begins `JSX`, and its only JSX fixture cannot
// see that branch at all, because the newlines in it are JSX text rather than a string literal. So
// the exemption is untested upstream and would ship broken either way.
//
// Enumerating every JSX position a string literal can occupy in our parser gives exactly two
// parents: `KindJsxAttribute` for a bare attribute value, and `KindJsxExpression` for a string
// inside braces, whether those braces are an attribute value or element content. Driving the
// installed ESLint build (version 10.8.1, through the Linter API) over the same four shapes shows
// both exempt.
//
// The spread case is the boundary and it is the reason this is not simply "anything inside JSX":
// a string in an object literal spread into an element has a `PropertyAssignment` parent, which is
// not a JSX kind, and it reports. Measured on the installed build.
//
// Without the exemption this rule would report every multiline attribute value in every component
// file in the tree, which is a false-positive class no imported fixture can see.
