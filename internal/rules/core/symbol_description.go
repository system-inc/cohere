// # It is a scope question, not a call-shape one
//
// Four of upstream's six clean cases are shadowing, and a rule matching the name textually reports
// every one. Upstream asks `eslint-scope` for the variable named `Symbol` and proceeds only when it
// has NO definitions, which is its way of saying "this is the global one". `resolvesToAGlobal` in
// this package asks the same question through the checker: it resolves the identifier and answers
// true only when every declaration behind it lives in a declaration file.
//
// Probed against all eight of upstream's cases rather than taken from the helper's name. The four
// shadowing cases each resolve to a single non-ambient declaration and the global cases each resolve
// to four ambient ones from the standard library. The verdicts agree on all eight, and on eight more
// beyond the corpus.
//
// # Three decisions upstream makes that read as oversights
//
// All three measured against the installed build at 10.8.1, and all three reproduced rather than
// improved on.
//
// `new Symbol()` is CLEAN. It throws at run time and carries no description either, but upstream's
// `isCallee` is false for a `new` expression, so the rule never sees it. Anchoring on
// `KindCallExpression` alone reproduces that.
//
// `Symbol(undefined)` and `Symbol(...args)` are CLEAN. The check is `arguments.length === 0`, so a
// spread that expands to nothing and an explicit undefined both pass. Counting arguments rather than
// inspecting them is the decision.
//
// `globalThis.Symbol()` is CLEAN, because there the identifier is a property rather than the callee.
//
// # Parentheses
//
// Espree gives a parenthesized expression no node, so upstream's `isCallee` already sees through
// them and reports `(Symbol)()` at columns 1 to 11. typescript-go produces one, so the callee is
// skipped through before it is resolved, and the span stays on the whole call including those
// parentheses.
