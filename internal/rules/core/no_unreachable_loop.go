		"leaves the loop. Whatever the loop condition says, the body breaks, returns, or throws " +
		"on every path, so the loop reads as a repetition and behaves as a plain block that runs " +
		"once. That is almost always a bug in the body rather than a deliberate shape: an exit " +
		"that was meant to be conditional, or a `continue` that was written as a `break`. If one " +
		"iteration really is what was wanted, say so with an `if` instead of a loop.",

//	valid:   while (a) { if (foo) break; }
//	valid:   for (;;);                                   an infinite loop iterates
//	valid:   function foo() { return; while (a) break; } the loop is itself unreachable
//	valid:   while (a) break;                            with ignore: ["WhileStatement"]
//	invalid: while (a) break;
//	invalid: do break; while (a)
//	invalid: for (a of b) break;
//	invalid: while (a) for (;;);                         the OUTER loop, not the inner one
//	invalid: for (a in b) { while (foo) { if(baz) { break; } else { break; } } break; }   twice
//
// A loop exists to repeat. A body that leaves on every path repeats nothing, so the loop header is
// telling the reader something the code does not do. The interesting cases are the ones where the
// exit is not written at the top level of the body: a `switch` whose every arm returns, a `try`
// whose `catch` breaks, or a nested loop that never terminates.
//
// # This is a reachability question, and it is asked of the control-flow graph
//
// The judgment cannot be made syntactically. `while (a) { if (foo) break; }` is clean and
// `while (a) { if (foo) break; else return; }` is not, and nothing about the shape of the body
// separates them; what separates them is whether control can arrive back at the loop header.
//
// Upstream asks its code path analysis, through three events. `onCodePathSegmentLoop` fires where
// control flows back for another iteration; the loop selector records a loop when
// `isAnySegmentReachable` says the position it stands at is reachable; `Program:exit` reports
// whatever was recorded and never had a loop event.
//
// `internal/utilities/controlflow` answers all three. Its `Loop` hook is documented as running "where
// control flows back into a loop for another iteration of it" and it is handed the loop node
// directly, so upstream's `loopsByTargetSegments` map from segment to loop has no counterpart here:
// the event already names its loop. `Builder.Current().Reachable` is the reachability question, at
// both the loop statement and the loop event.
//
// # The reachability gate on the loop EVENT is load-bearing, and it is ours rather than upstream's
//
// Upstream gets reachability filtering for free, because ESLint's code path analysis does not raise
// a segment-loop event out of an unreachable segment at all. Our builder does: `statements.go`
// calls `b.loop(node)` at the end of every loop body unconditionally, whether or not control can be
// there. So a `Loop` event on its own is not evidence the loop iterates.
//
// Measured, and this is the single distinction the whole rule rests on: without the gate,
// `while (a) break;` receives a Loop event (from the body end, in the unreachable block the `break`
// left behind) and the rule goes completely silent on every case upstream reports. With the gate,
// all 1,629 corpus cases agree with the installed eslint 10.8.1 build.
//
// `continue` is the other half and needs no gate of its own: `makeContinue` returns early when the
// current block is unreachable, so an unreachable `continue` raises no event. The gate is written
// once, at the hook, and covers both.
//
// # Why the loop STATEMENT is gated too, and what it buys
//
// A loop standing in unreachable code is skipped, "to avoid unnecessary complexity in the
// implementation, or false positives otherwise" in upstream's words. So `function foo() { return;
// while (a) break; }` is clean, and so is the second loop of `while(true); while(true) break;`.
// That is a decision rather than an accident and it is reproduced: both are upstream valid cases.
//
// # What upstream deliberately does not catch
//
// Three shapes in the corpus's valid list are there because code path analysis does not evaluate
// conditions:
//
//	while (false) { foo(); }     never iterates at all, and is not reported
//	do foo(); while (false)      the same, from the other side
//	for (x of []);               an empty iterable, which is a value question
//
// Upstream's own comment calls these "out of scope for the code path analysis and consequently out
// of scope for this rule". They are reproduced as silence, and the corpus asserts each one.
//
// # Findings are sorted, and the reason is the multi-root walk
//
// Upstream reports from `Program:exit` over a set filled in traversal order, which is source order,
// and ESLint sorts its messages by position regardless. Here each code path root is built
// separately, so a loop inside a function is judged during that function's graph rather than during
// the file's, and emitting as they are found would interleave roots. `for (a in b) { while (foo) {
// if(baz) { break; } else { break; } } break; }` is the case that pins it: upstream reports the
// outer loop then the inner one, and `ExpectFindings` asserts ids in order.

				// fired 21, so the guard would decline nothing. It was written, scored with the
				// sweep, and removed as unreachable rather than kept as reassurance.

				// The verdict names the callers it was taken over: `control_flow_graph.Build`'s own

				// `expressions.go` as of this commit. If the builder ever descends into a nested
