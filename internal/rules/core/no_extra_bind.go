		"`.bind()` allocates a fresh function object, so the value is no longer equal to the one " +

// NoExtraBind flags a `.bind()` whose receiver cannot use the binding.

//	valid:   var a = function() { return this.b }.bind(c)
//	valid:   var a = function(b) { return b }.bind(c, d)
//	valid:   var a = f.bind(a)
//	valid:   var a = function() { return () => this; }.bind(b)
//	invalid: var a = function() { return 1; }.bind(b)
//	invalid: var a = (() => { return 1; }).bind(b)
//	invalid: var a = function() { return 1; }?.["bind"](b)
//
// Binding a function that never reads `this` is a no-op with two costs. It allocates a new function
// every time, and the result is a different object from the one that went in, so a listener
// registered with `handler.bind(this)` can never be removed with `handler`, and anything keyed on
// callback identity sees a new key. An arrow function is the sharper case: its `this` is fixed at
// the point it is written and `.bind()` cannot move it, so binding one is always pointless whether
// or not it mentions `this`.
//
// # What decides it
//
// The receiver must be a function expression or an arrow function; the property must be `bind`
// spelled statically, so a dot, a string subscript, or a template with no substitutions; and the
// call must pass exactly one argument that is not a spread. Two arguments means the extra ones are
// partial application, which does something regardless of `this`, and a spread means the count is
// not knowable.
//
// Then: a function expression is reported only if no `this` appears in its own scope. `this` inside
// a nested function belongs to that function, so it does not save the outer bind, and `this` inside
// a nested ARROW does, because an arrow takes `this` from where it is written. An arrow receiver
// needs no such scan and is always reported, since binding cannot change its `this` either way.
//
// # Why this gathers over the file rather than tracking a stack
//
// Upstream keeps a stack, pushing on function entry and popping on exit, and reports at the pop,
// because it has to know whether a `this` appeared anywhere in the body before it can judge the
// function. There is no exit listener here and the walk is pre-order, so the same information is
// gathered in one pass over the file: for each candidate receiver, walk its body and look for a
// `this` that belongs to it. That answers the same question the stack answers, and it does it
// without depending on visit order.
//
// # The fixer, and the two things it refuses
//
// The repair removes the `.bind` and the argument list, which is two disjoint spans rather than one,
// because parentheses may sit between them: `(function(){}.bind ) (obj)` has to lose `.bind` and
// ` (obj)` while keeping the parenthesis in the middle. Upstream builds exactly these two spans and
// so does this.
//
// It declines twice, and both declines are decisions rather than gaps. An argument that is not
// obviously side-effect free is left alone, because `f.bind(b())` still calls `b()` and removing the
// call would stop it: upstream's allowed set is literal, identifier, `this`, and function
// expression, and it says in a comment that the set is stricter than it needs to be. And a comment
// anywhere inside the removal span is left alone, because deleting the span would delete the comment
// with it. Twelve of upstream's thirty-two failing cases carry `output: null` for one of these two
// reasons, and reproducing the decline is the point: a fixer that repaired them would delete a
// comment or a side effect unattended.
//
// A trailing comment AFTER the call survives, because it is outside both spans:
// `function(){}.bind(b)/**/` becomes `function(){}/**/`. That falls out of the spans rather than
// being handled, and it is stated because it looks like an oversight.
