	Id: "noClassAssign",
	Description: "This assigns to a class binding. The binding is const-like inside the class body " +
		"and the assignment throws in strict mode, which every module and every class body already " +
		"is, so the line fails at runtime rather than rebinding anything. Where it does not throw " +
		"it is worse: every later use of the name gets the new value instead of the class, so " +
		"`new A()` constructs something else and `instanceof A` answers about something else. Use a " +
		"separate variable for the new value.",
}

// NoClassAssign flags an assignment to the name a class declares.
//
//	valid:   class A { } foo(A);
//	valid:   class A { b(A) { A = 0; } }
//	valid:   let A = class A { }; A = 1;
//	valid:   class A { } A.x = 0;
//	invalid: class A { } A = 0;
//	invalid: A = 0; class A { }
//	invalid: class A { b() { A = 0; } }
//	invalid: let A = class A { b() { A = 0; } }
//
// A class declaration binds its name like a `let`, so the assignment parses and the mistake is
// silent at the line that makes it. What it costs shows up somewhere else: the name now holds
// whatever was assigned, so `new A()` constructs that instead, `extends A` extends that instead, and
// `instanceof A` answers a question about that instead. Inside the class body the binding is
// immutable and the write throws outright.
//
// # Why this reads the checker
//
// The discrimination is entirely name resolution and none of it is structural. Four of upstream's
// clean cases write to a name spelled exactly like the class:
//
//	class A { b(A) { A = 0; } }              a parameter shadows it
//	class A { b() { let A; A = 0; } }        a local shadows it
//	let A = class A { }; A = 1;              the variable, not the class name
//	if (foo) { class A {} } else { class A {} } A = 1;   binds to neither
//
// Their text is identical to the failing forms, so a rule matching on the name reports all four.
// Upstream answers with `get_resolved_references`, which is a find-all-references index we do not
// have. The equivalent question our checker does answer is which declaration a given identifier
// binds to, so this anchors on the class node the listener already received and asks, for each
// write, whether the resolved symbol's first declaration is that same node.
//
// Node identity rather than declaration kind. Comparing kinds looks like it would work here, since
// the anchor is a class and a shadow is usually a parameter or a variable, but it is a near miss
// that the if/else case defeats outright: both siblings are `KindClassDeclaration`, so a kind test
// calls the second one's declaration a match for the first and reports a write that binds to
// neither. The same trap is sharper for the sibling rules on `const`, where a `const A` and a
// shadowing `let A` are both `KindVariableDeclaration` and kind cannot separate them at all.
//
// # Why the checker is not sufficient on its own
//
// Symbol identity says which binding an identifier names; it says nothing about whether the
// occurrence writes. `class A { } A.x = 0;` and `class A { } foo(A);` both resolve to the class and
// neither reassigns it, so the rule needs the structural half too and reports only where the two
// agree. `reference.WritesToBinding` is that half, shared with five sibling rules.
//
// # The one shape the checker answers differently
//
// `({A} = 0)` is a shorthand property in an object literal being used as a destructuring target, and
// `GetSymbolAtLocation` on its identifier returns the property's own symbol rather than the value
// being written. TypeScript has a separate accessor for the value side, and reaching for it is the
// difference between reporting this case and silently missing it. Measured on the corpus rather than
// assumed: the plain accessor answers "different declaration" here, which reads exactly like a
// correctly declined shadow.
//
// No fix. The repair is a new binding, which means choosing a name and deciding which later uses of
// the old one meant the class, and the rule cannot know that.
