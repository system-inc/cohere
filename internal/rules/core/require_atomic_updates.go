// A suspended function is not holding the world still. Between the read on the right and the store
// on the left, every other task queued in the same runtime gets to run, and any of them may write
// the same variable. The write here then lands carrying a value computed from what the variable held
// before the suspension, silently discarding whatever happened during it. The classic shape is a
// counter, `count += await next()`, which loses increments under concurrency and is correct in every
// single-stepped test.
//
// # The judgment is a flow question and cannot be answered from the assignment
//
// `foo = foo + await bar` reports and `foo = await bar + foo` does not, and the two differ only in
// which side of the suspension the read of `foo` sits on. Nothing about the assignment node, the
// symbol, or the enclosing function separates them: the discrimination is the ORDER of a read, a
// suspension, and a write along a path, which is exactly what a control-flow graph carries and what
// a syntactic walk cannot see. Upstream reaches this with ESLint's code path analysis, tracking two
// per-segment sets and moving variables between them.
//
// # The lattice, and why it is a forward analysis over one set
//
// Upstream carries `freshReadVariables` and `outdatedReadVariables` per segment, but the second is
// the only one whose value is asked at a report site: `isOutdated` consults it and nothing consults
// the fresh set directly. The fresh set exists to be moved into the outdated one at a suspension and
// to be cleared by a later read, so its whole contribution is bookkeeping between two events inside
// one block.
//
// That collapses. This runs a FORWARD dataflow over a single set, "variables read before a
// suspension that no later read has refreshed", met by union across predecessors. Inside a block the
// transfer walks events in order: a read removes the variable from the outdated set and records it
// as freshly read, a suspension moves every freshly read variable into the outdated set, and a write
// is judged against the set as it stands. Union is upstream's own meet, reached in
// `SegmentInfo#initialize` by folding every previous segment's two sets together, and `isOutdated`
// answering true if ANY current segment holds the variable is the same disjunction on the other
// side.
//
// The block-local fresh set is not part of the lattice value because it cannot survive a block
// boundary in upstream either: `initialize` copies a predecessor's fresh set forward, but the only
// thing that ever reads a fresh variable is `makeOutdated` at a suspension, and a suspension always
// starts a new segment upstream. Measured rather than argued: the whole 63-case corpus reproduces
// with the fresh set block-local, including case 2's loop and case 26's try/catch, which are the two
// shapes where a cross-block fresh set would show.
//
// # Which references are candidates, and the three filters upstream applies
//
// Upstream builds a reference map per function scope and only for scopes that can suspend, then
// applies three filters at the report site. All three are reproduced:
//
//	the function suspends       only an async function or a generator is judged at all. A plain
//	                            function has no suspension point, so no read can go outdated.
//	the reference resolves      an unresolved identifier is skipped by `createReferenceMap`
//	                            outright. See the divergence note below, because this is the one
//	                            place our substrate answers a different question than ESLint's.
//	the variable escapes        a variable only this function can observe cannot be written by
//	                            anything else during the suspension, so no race is possible.
//	                            `isLocalVariableWithoutEscape`.
//
// # The escape filter, measured against the installed rule rather than read
//
// This is the filter most likely to be ported slightly wrong, so each row below is a command that
// was run against ESLint 10.8.1 rather than a reading of the source:
//
//	async function x() { let foo; foo += await bar; }                       clean   declared inside,
//	                                                                               never captured
//	async function x() { let foo; bar(() => foo); foo += await amount; }    reports captured by a
//	                                                                               closure
//	async function x() { let foo; bar(() => baz += 1); foo += await b; }    clean   a closure that
//	                                                                               does not name it
//	let foo; async function x() { foo += await amount; }                    reports declared outside
//	async function x() { foo += await bar; }                                clean   unresolved
//	async function f(foo) { foo = await bar; }                              clean   a parameter, for
//	                                                                               the variable arm
//	async function f(foo) { let b = await get(foo.id); foo.bar = b.bar; }   reports a parameter, for
//	                                                                               the property arm

//
// The last two are the parameter special case and they are not symmetric, which reads as an
// inconsistency and is deliberate upstream: `isMemberAccess && variable.defs.some(Parameter)`
// returns false EARLY, before the escape scan runs. A parameter's object is reachable by the caller
// whatever this function does with the binding, so a property write on it is observable outside; the
// binding itself is not, so a plain reassignment of it is local. Two questions, one predicate,
// opposite answers, and the corpus pins both.
//
// # Two divergences from ESLint, both measured on the whole tree and both kept
//
// Run end to end over `~/Projects/ahra` on 2026-08-26, verify reports 39 and ESLint 31, and the
// difference is entirely one-way: verify is a strict SUPERSET, with 8 findings ESLint declines and
// zero that ESLint reports and verify misses. Both classes are recorded below with the reduction
// that isolates them, because each is a place a later reader would otherwise "fix" verify back to
// ESLint's answer.
//
// # Divergence one, resolution: 7 of the 8
//
// Upstream skips a reference whose `resolved` is null, so an identifier naming nothing declared is
// never judged. ESLint decides "declared" from its own scope analysis plus the configured globals
// list, and verify has neither: our answer comes from the checker, which resolves against the
// program's type declarations.
//
// The two disagree in one direction, and upstream's own corpus contains the case. Case 26 assigns
// `process.exitCode` and upstream ships it with `globals: { process: "readonly" }` in its language
// options. Measured on the installed rule: with that global declared it reports twice, and with the
// SAME source and no global declared it is completely silent. In this tree `process` resolves
// through the ambient node declarations, so we report where a bare ESLint run on an untyped file
// would not.
//
//	node drive2.js require-atomic-updates '[{"code": <case 26>, "globals": {"process": "readonly"}}]'
//	  -> REPORT[nonAtomicObjectUpdate,nonAtomicObjectUpdate]
//	node drive2.js require-atomic-updates '[{"code": <case 26>}]'
//	  -> clean
//
// The divergence is a strict superset in favour of reporting, and it is the right direction here:
// the reason upstream skips an unresolved name is that it cannot tell a global from a typo, not that
// a global cannot race. A global is in fact the MOST racy thing in the file. `TestRequireAtomicUpdatesResolutionDivergence`
// pins it so the next reader sees a measurement rather than inherits an argument.
//
// On the real tree this accounts for 7 of the 8 extras, all of them the same shape: a handler saved
// into a local, replaced, and restored in a `finally` after an await.
//
//	const originalLog = console.log;
//	console.log = function () { ... };
//	try { return await callback(); }
//	finally { console.log = originalLog; }
//
// `modules/art/ArtTerminal.ts:414-416` and `modules/phi/social/PhiSocialTerminal.ts:480-482` are
// that pattern over `console.log`, `console.info` and `process.stdout.write`. Measured on the
// installed rule, the SAME source reports when `console` is a declared global and is silent when it
// is not.
//
// Why those two names are undeclared HERE is narrower than "the config has no globals", and the
// narrow version is the one that survives a grep. `StructureLintConfiguration.ts` declares globals
// in two places and the two lists differ:
//
//	line 91   the JavaScript block's own list: __dirname, __filename, module, require,
//	          process, console, global, Buffer. Spread into the JS config at line 441,
//	          which applies to `**/*.{mjs,js,jsx}`.
//	line 158  StructureJavaScriptAndTypeScriptGlobals: React, document, window, navigator,
//	          setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval. This is the ONLY list
//	          the TypeScript block gets, at line 460.
//
// So `console` and `process` are declared for JavaScript files and not for TypeScript ones, and
// every finding in this class is in a `.ts` file. A reader who checks "no globals anywhere" will
// find eight of them and reasonably doubt the rest of this note; the true statement is that these
// two specific names are absent from the list `.ts` files receive.
//
// Two controls, because a zero here has three plausible causes and reading the config separates
// none of them. A seeded `alert()` in `ArtTerminal.ts` was reported by the same ESLint run, so the
// file is linted and the silence is the rule declining rather than the file being skipped. And a
// seeded pair in that same file, two structurally identical writes in one `finally`, one over a
// locally declared object and one over `console`, produced exactly one ESLint finding: the local
// one. Same file, same shape, same run, opposite verdicts, which is the resolution difference
// isolated to the one variable that changed.
//
// These are true positives. Two overlapping calls to such a wrapper restore in the wrong order and
// the second restore installs a filter that was already torn down, which is the last-writer-wins
// hazard this rule exists to name.
//
// # Divergence two, a refresh credited across a throwing edge: the 8th
//
// ESLint clears a variable's outdated mark at a read, and carries that clearing into the `catch` of
// an enclosing `try`. So a read at the END of a try block silences a write in the catch, even though
// the catch is reached precisely on the paths where that read did not run.
//
// Reduced to the pair that isolates it, measured on eslint 10.8.1:
//
//	async function f(e) { if (e.s !== 1) return;
//	    try { await a(); e.p = await b(); } catch (x) { e.err = 1; } }
//	  -> ESLint reports BOTH writes
//
//	async function f(e) { if (e.s !== 1) return;
//	    try { await a(); e.p = await b(); use(e.p); } catch (x) { e.err = 1; } }
//	  -> ESLint reports only `e.p`, and goes silent on `e.err`
//
// The two differ by the single read `use(e.p)`. Reading an UNRELATED variable there does not change
// the verdict, and adding a further await after the read restores it, which together show the
// mechanism is the refresh rather than statement count or position.
//
// The catch runs when `await b()` rejects. On that path `use(e.p)` never executes, so the refresh
// ESLint credits did not happen and `e` is still built from a pre-suspension read. Verify reports
// it; ESLint does not. This is `modules/kingdom/KingdomShadeController.ts:203`, and it is the only
// one of the 8 where the two implementations disagree about a JUDGMENT rather than about what
// resolves.
//
// Kept deliberately. A refresh that only happens on the non-throwing path cannot make the throwing
// path safe, and our graph forks to the handler as a real successor edge, which is why we see it and
// upstream's segment bookkeeping does not.
// `TestRequireAtomicUpdatesCatchDoesNotInheritTryRefresh` pins both directions.
//
// # No fix and no suggestion, matching upstream
//
// `meta.fixable` is null and there is no `suggest` anywhere in the rule. The repair is a
// restructuring rather than a rewrite: moving the read past the suspension changes which value the
// expression sees, which is the entire point and is not something a linter may do unattended. There
// is also no single right answer, since the author may have meant to re-read, to lock, or to hold
// the value deliberately.
