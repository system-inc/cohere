// A file of its own rather than a line in the package's shared `register.go`, so two authors landing
// at once touch nothing in common. Written immediately after the rule variable compiled rather than
// last, so `TestEveryRuleIsRegistered` never names this rule to a sibling as an abandoned port.
//
// No `Decode`: upstream's `meta.schema` is `[]`, so the rule has no option surface at all.
