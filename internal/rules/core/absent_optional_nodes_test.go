// Every rule in this package is run over shapes where a node it reaches for is legitimately absent.
//
// Ported from the structure package's guard, which exists because a shipped rule crashed on a nil
// that review had read past twice. `ast.SkipParentheses` dereferences its argument, so a nil check
// placed after the call rather than before it panics, and the shapes that produce a nil are
// ordinary rather than exotic.
//
// A crash is worse than a wrong finding. A wrong finding is visible and arguable; a panic takes
// down the walk for the whole file, so every other rule's verdict on that file is lost with it, and
// on a 3,407-file tree the file that crashed is one line in a log nobody reads. It fails in the
// direction of silence.
//
// This package earns its own copy: it holds eleven `SkipParentheses` call sites across five rules,
// more than anywhere else in the tree, and its rules reach for initializers, arguments, discriminants
// and catch clauses that need not exist.
//
// # The one call site that is safe only by an invariant
//
// `prefer_spread.go` passes `memberAccessObject(callee)` straight into `SkipParentheses`, and that
// helper returns nil for a callee that is neither a property nor an element access. It cannot fire,
// because an `isApplyMemberAccess` gate fifteen lines earlier has already excluded every other kind.
// Widening that gate reintroduces a panic at a line the change does not touch, and this guard is
// what would catch it. The comment there says the same thing at the site.
//
// # What a pass here does and does not mean
//
// The shape list is the measurement and it is short. A green run means every listed rule survived
// these shapes. It is not a claim that the package cannot panic, and the two are indistinguishable
// from here.
//
// A probe that does not reach a line proves nothing about the line, only about the inputs. When a
// new rule reaches for something optional in a shape not listed, the fix is to add the shape rather
// than to trust the green.
