//
// A label is a control-flow name that only `break` and `continue` can read, so a jump can leave
// from a line carrying no visible marker and resume somewhere the reader has to go find. The rule
// exists because reading top to bottom stops telling you where control goes.
//
// # One input, up to three findings
//
// The label and the jumps that name it are separate findings, which the corpus states outright:
// `label: while (true) { break label; }` names two ids and the nested-label case names three. A
// port reporting once per input passes nothing here, and a port reporting once per LABEL still
// misses the jump.
//
// # The permission is decided by what the label WRAPS, not by what the jump sits in
//
// `allowLoop` exempts a label whose body is a loop; `allowSwitch` exempts one whose body is a
// switch. The corpus pins that the test is on the labeled statement's own body and nothing else:
//
//	A: for (var a in obj) { for (;;) { switch (a) { case 0: continue A; } } }   allowLoop: clean
//	A: for (var a in obj) { for (;;) { switch (a) { case 0: break A; } } }      allowSwitch: reports
//
// Same shape, same nesting, opposite verdicts, and the only difference is which option is set. The
// `continue A` in the first sits lexically inside a switch and is still permitted, because `A`
// labels a `for`. So a port asking "is this jump inside a loop" reports the first and is wrong; the
// question is what `A` names.
//
// That is why the jumps resolve through a label STACK rather than through their own ancestors. A
// jump names a label; the label's kind decides.
//
// # Reporting the label on exit, which is where the finding ORDER comes from
//
// Upstream reports a labeled statement from `LabeledStatement:exit` and a labeled jump on entry.
// The corpus's three-finding case is what pins it:
//
//	A: switch (a) { case 0: B: { break A; } default: break; };
//	unexpectedLabel, unexpectedLabel, unexpectedLabelInBreak
//
// Both labels report before the break, and `B` is nested inside `A`. Entry order would give A, B,
// break. Exit order gives B, A, break -- still two labels first. The break comes last either way
// because it is deeper than both, but the label pair only precedes it under exit ordering, since on
// entry `A` fires before the break is reached and `B` fires after it. Reproduced here by collecting
// during the walk and emitting labels before jumps, which is the same observable order without an
// exit hook.
//
// There is no `rule.OnExit` and the walk is pre-order, so the whole judgment happens inside one
// `KindSourceFile` listener: it fires before its children, so the walk, the label stack, and the
// emission all live there.
//
// # The trap the first clean case sets
//
// `var f = { label: foo ()}` is an object property named `label`. A rule keyed on the identifier,
// or on a colon, reports it. Anchoring on `KindLabeledStatement` declines it by kind.
//
// No fix. Removing a label means restructuring the control flow it names, which is a rewrite rather
// than a spelling change.
