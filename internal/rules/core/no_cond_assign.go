//
// Mistyping `==` as `=` inside a condition is one of the oldest defects in the language and one of
// the quietest: the code parses, runs, assigns, and then branches on the assigned value, so the
// condition is not merely wrong but has a side effect the reader does not expect.
//
// # The option is about parentheses, and the default is the permissive one
//
// There is a real idiom here that the rule must not break. `while ((match = regex.exec(s)) !== null)`
// is the standard way to iterate matches, and the extra parentheses are how an author says the
// assignment was meant. Under `except-parens`, the default, an assignment only reports when it is
// *directly* the test, so wrapping it silences the rule. Under `always`, parentheses stop meaning
// anything and every assignment reachable from the test reports.
//
// Getting that backwards fires on exactly the code people write to declare their intent, so the
// fixtures pin both directions and the unconfigured default separately.
//
// # Five test positions, and the ones that are not tests
//
// `if`, `while`, `do`, the middle clause of `for`, and the test of a ternary. Not the `for`
// initializer or updater, which are statement positions where an assignment is the point, and not a
// `case` label, which is compared rather than tested. Upstream's pass list covers all four of those
// near misses.
//
// # An upstream asymmetry, reproduced
//
// A ternary test has its parentheses stripped in *both* modes, while the four statement forms strip
// them only under `always`. So `if ((a = b));` passes under the default and
// `((a = b)) ? x : y` reports under it. That is inconsistent, and it looks like an oversight rather
// than a decision: nothing in the rule or its documentation distinguishes a ternary's parentheses
// from an if's. It is reproduced here because upstream's own fail corpus pins it, with
// `(((3496.29)).bkufyydt = 2e308) ? foo : bar;` listed as a failure under no options at all. A port
// that "fixed" it would disagree with the reference on a case the reference explicitly tests.
//
// # One finding per assignment, where upstream emits two
//
// Upstream runs two branches that overlap. Its statement branch reports an assignment sitting
// directly in a test, and under `always` its assignment branch walks ancestors and reports any
// assignment inside a test's span, which includes that same direct one. Nine inputs in its own fail
// corpus therefore snapshot the identical diagnostic twice, at byte-identical spans, which is how
// 21 failing inputs produce 30 diagnostics.
//
// That is a defect rather than a gap upstream chose: a duplicated finding at one span is not a
// second thing to fix, and it double-counts in any total. The walk under `always` already covers
// the direct case on its own, so this reports through one path per mode and emits one finding. The
// divergence is stated rather than silent, and the fixtures assert the single count.
