		"the language accepts and almost no reader expects. Whatever indentation the next line " +
		"carries goes into the value, so the string changes meaning when somebody reformats the " +

// NoMultiStr flags a string literal continued across a line break with a trailing backslash.
//
//	valid:   'Line 1 Line 2'
//	valid:   'Line 1 \n Line 2'      // an escape, so no real line break is in the source
//	valid:   `Line 1
//	          Line 2`                 // a template literal, which is the supported spelling
//	invalid: 'Line 1 \
//	          Line 2'
//
// # The subject is the raw text, and the distinction it draws is sharp
//
// Upstream tests `LINEBREAK_MATCHER` against `node.raw`, not against the value. A `\n` escape and a
// real line continuation produce nearly the same value and completely different source: the escape
// puts one newline character into the string and leaves the source on one line, while the
// continuation puts nothing into the string and spreads the source across two. Only the second is
// what this rule objects to, and only the raw text can tell them apart. Reading the cooked value
// would report the escape, which is the ordinary and correct way to write a newline.
//
// # Four terminators, not one
//
// `LINEBREAK_MATCHER` matches a carriage-return-line-feed pair, or any single line feed, carriage
// return, line separator (U+2028), or paragraph separator (U+2029). All four count, and three of
// upstream's five failing cases use exactly the three that are not a line feed, which is how the
// set is pinned rather than guessed. The pair branch exists so the pattern consumes both bytes of
// a Windows break as one match; since this rule only asks whether a break is present at all, that
// branch makes no difference here and the membership test below says the same thing.
//
// # The JSX exemption is real, and it is about the PARENT
//
// Upstream declines when `node.parent.type` starts with `JSX`. The shape that reaches it is a
// string-valued JSX attribute, whose parent is a `JSXAttribute`, and the exemption is why a
// multiline attribute value is left alone. Measured against the installed ESLint build,
// `<div attr='Line 1 \` continued onto a second line is clean while the identical string in a call
// argument reports.
//
// This is not vestigial in our tree. Our parser produces exactly `KindJsxAttribute` as the parent
// of such a string, measured, so the branch is reachable and load bearing. Dropping it as
// simplification would report every multiline attribute value in every component file, a
// false-positive class the imported corpus cannot see, because the only JSX case upstream ships is
// a `<div>` whose newlines are in JSX text rather than in a string literal.
//
// Upstream's test is a prefix test over a type name, which matches every JSX node kind rather than
// the attribute alone, and the breadth is reproduced here rather than narrowed to the shapes that
// first come to mind. That is not caution, it is a measurement that a narrower version already
// failed once.
//
// Enumerating parents over ten well-formed JSX shapes gives two: `KindJsxAttribute` for a bare
// attribute value and `KindJsxExpression` for a string inside braces, whether those braces are an
// attribute value or element content. Narrowing the enumeration to exactly those two survived the
// entire fixture set. Re-running the enumeration over malformed and unusual source as well, which
// the parser recovers from rather than refusing, turned up a third: `KindJsxSpreadAttribute`, from
// a string spread directly as attributes rather than through an object literal. Upstream is silent
// on that input; measured on the installed build. So the arm is reachable, load bearing, and now
// pinned by a fixture.
//
// The remaining kinds in the enumeration are not reachable as a string literal's parent by anything
// tried, well formed or not. They are kept because upstream's question is "is this string part of
// JSX syntax" and its prefix test answers yes for all of them, so a narrower test would be a
// different rule that happens to agree on today's parse shapes. That verdict names the shapes it
// was taken over: adding a caller or a parser change can expire it.
//
// A string in an object literal spread into an element does report, because its parent is a
// `PropertyAssignment` rather than anything JSX; measured both ways.
//
// # Templates are not this rule's surface
//
// A template literal spanning lines is the repair rather than the defect, and it is a different
// node in ESTree that never reaches the handler. Measured: a multiline template is clean upstream.
// Here that falls out of the listener map.
//
// The rule reports without a repair, matching upstream, which ships no fixer and marks itself
// `frozen`. Any repair would have to choose between concatenation and a template and would have to
// decide what happens to the leading whitespace on the continued line, which is exactly the value
// the author may or may not have meant to include.
