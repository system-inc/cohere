// halves of one accessor, so using either half uses both, and a pair with neither half referenced
// has to report once rather than twice. Upstream's map is keyed the same way and its corpus pins
// the count.

//	valid:   class A { #m() {} n() { return this.#m(); } }
//	valid:   class A { set #a(v) {} m() { this.#a = 1; } }
//	valid:   class A { #brand; static has(o) { return #brand in o; } }

//	invalid: class A { #counter = 0; m() { this.#counter++; } }
//	invalid: class A { #unusedMethod() {} }
//
// A private member is visible only inside the class body that declares it, which is what makes this
// rule decidable at all: there is no other file to check and no dynamic access to worry about, so a
// member no line of this class body reads is dead with certainty rather than by inference. That
// certainty is the whole reason the rule can be in `correctness` instead of a style tier.
//
// # Written but never read is the finding, not merely never mentioned
//
// The interesting half is not `#unused = 1` with no other mention, which any reader spots. It is a
// field the class assigns and never reads back, because that one looks busy. `this.#writeOnly = 42`
// reads like the member is doing work while the value it stores can never be observed, so the
// assignment is as dead as the declaration and usually the residue of a refactor that removed the
// reader. Same for `this.#counter++` as a statement, which increments a number nobody will ever
// look at.
//
// So the question a reference is asked is "is this a read", and the write forms are enumerated
// rather than inferred. A compound assignment is the sharp edge: `this.#x += 1` discarded as a
// statement is write-only, but `return this.#x += 1` reads the value, so the same operator lands on
// either side of the line depending on whether the result is used. `++this.#x` splits the same way.
//
// # An accessor is used by any reference, including a pure write
//
// `set #a(v) {}` referenced only as `this.#a = 1` is *used*, unlike a field with the same shape,
// because the assignment calls the setter body and that body can have effects the class depends on.
// This is the one place where the rule cannot reason from the reference alone: it has to know what
// the member is. Getting this backwards reports every write-only setter in the tree, which is the
// normal way to write one.
//
// # The brand check is a use that looks like nothing else
//
// `#brand in obj` is the only reference to a private name that is not a property access. It parses
// as a binary expression whose left operand is the bare `PrivateIdentifier`, with no member
// expression above it, so a rule that only inspects `PropertyAccessExpression` nodes cannot see it
// and reports a live brand check as dead. It is a read.
//
// # Where this follows ESLint over oxc
//
// oxc reports four cases ESLint declares clean, all the same shape: a conditional whose result is
// discarded as a statement, such as `class Foo { #x; m() { a ? this.#x : b; } }`. oxc tracks whether
// the conditional's value reaches a value context and calls the read dead when it does not.
//
// Measured against `eslint@9` rather than assumed: all four are clean there, and they are the only
// semantic disagreement between the two implementations across the whole 87-case corpus. The other
// ten places the two differ are TypeScript syntax ESLint's default parser rejects, which says
// nothing about the rule.
//
// This follows ESLint, for a reason specific to what kind of rule this is. Every finding here is an
// accusation that code is dead, so a false positive lands on correct code and asks the reader to
// delete something that works. Reading `this.#x` in a discarded ternary still runs a getter if `#x`
// is one, and still pins the field against a later refactor, so calling it dead is a claim about
// intent rather than about reachability. When the two upstreams disagree on an unused-thing rule,
// the quieter one is the right default and the divergence is stated rather than silent.
//
// # Why the fix is a suggestion upstream and nothing here
//
// ESLint offers removal as a *suggestion*, never as an unattended fix, and oxc ships no repair at
// all. Deleting a member changes the shape of the class: the surrounding comment may describe it,
// a `declare` may be pinning a type another file depends on, and the author's answer is at least as
// often "add the reader I forgot" as "delete this". That is a choice a human makes, so nothing is
// proposed here rather than proposing a rewrite the engine would apply while the reader is not
// looking.
