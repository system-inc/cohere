		"That coercion is usually what the author wanted and is never what the code says, so a " +
		"reader cannot tell a deliberate both-values check from a typo. Write `=== null` when only " +
		"null is meant, or `== null` deliberately somewhere the convention says so.",

// NoEqNull flags a loose comparison against the `null` literal.
//
//	valid:   if (x === null) { }
//	valid:   if (null === f()) { }
//	valid:   if (x == undefined) { }
//	invalid: if (x == null) { }
//	invalid: if (x != null) { }
//	invalid: do {} while (null == x)
//
// Either side counts, because `null == x` and `x == null` are the same comparison written two ways
// and upstream tests both. Only `==` and `!=` count: `===` and `!==` are the repair the rule asks
// for, and `<`, `>`, `+` and the rest are different operators entirely.
//
// # The literal, not the value
//
// Upstream's predicate is `node.right.raw === "null"`, which is the SOURCE TEXT of the operand
// rather than anything about its value. So `x == undefined` is clean even though the comparison it
// performs is identical, and `let n = null; x == n` is clean because the operand is an identifier.
// Both measured against the installed build. That looks like an oversight and is the rule: it is a
// spelling rule about a literal, and widening it to "anything that is nullish" would be a different
// rule with a different false-positive surface.
//
// # Parentheses, which are a real divergence in the AST and not in the behaviour
//
// Upstream reads `node.right` directly with no parenthesis skip, which reads as though
// `x == (null)` must be clean. It is not: espree does not produce a node for a parenthesized
// expression at all, so `node.right` there IS the literal. typescript-go does produce one, so
// reading `binary.Right` directly would go silent on a case upstream reports.
//
// Measured against ESLint 10.8.1 with `sourceType: "script"`:
//
//	if (x == (null)) { }   reports, columns 5 to 16
//	if ((null) == x) { }   reports, columns 5 to 16
//
// So the skip is required for fidelity rather than being an improvement on upstream, and the span
// stays on the whole binary expression, parentheses included, which is what those columns say.
