// Both properties throw in strict mode, and every module and class body is strict, so code reaching
// for them either already fails or is running in the shrinking part of the language where it does
// not. They also defeat the optimizations engines apply to functions whose callers are statically
// known, which is why the restriction exists rather than being merely stylistic.
//
// # The subscript form is not the same question
//
// `arguments[caller]` reads a *variable* named caller and gets whatever property that names, which
// is a different access and may not be either of these. Upstream matches the static member form
// only, and the fourth clean case pins that: a rule reading the source text, or one treating a
// computed access as equivalent, reports code that does nothing of the kind.
//
// `arguments[0]` is the same shape and is ordinary.
//
// # No fix, and none is possible
//
// There is no mechanical replacement. `arguments.callee` is usually repaired by naming the function
// and referring to it, which requires choosing a name, and `arguments.caller` has no replacement at
// all: the information it carried is not available another way. A rule offering a fix here would be
// offering to guess.
