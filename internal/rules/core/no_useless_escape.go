// An escape that the language does not need is not a no-op to a reader: it says "this character is
// special here" about a character that is not, which is exactly the signal somebody follows when
// deciding whether a pattern is doing something subtle. Removing it is the version that means the
// same thing and reads as what it is.
//
// # Three surfaces, three different tables
//
// String literals, template literals, and regex literals each answer "which escapes are needed"
// differently, and a port that shares one table across them is wrong on every case that separates
// them. A string literal needs `\n` and its own quote character; a template needs backtick and the
// `${` sequence instead; a regex needs whichever of two dozen metacharacters is special at that
// position. `\d` is required in none of the three and mandatory in the fourth reading nobody has:
// inside a regex it is a class escape and reports nothing, inside a string it is useless and
// reports.
//
// # Position decides inside a regex, not just the character
//
// Two characters cannot be judged by the table alone.
//
// A caret must be escaped outside a character class, and inside one only at the very start, since
// that is the one position where it means negation. So `/\^bar/` and `/[\^bar]/` are both clean and
// `/[^\^]/` is not.
//
// A hyphen is the mirror image: escaping it is only meaningful inside a class and away from its
// edges, where it would otherwise open a range. `/[a\-b]/` is clean and `/[ab\-]/`, `/[\-ab]/` and
// `/\-/` are not.
//
// Under the `v` flag a third rule appears. That flag reserves nineteen punctuators as doubled
// operators, so `&&`, `!!` and their kin have syntactic meaning and escaping one half of a pair is
// how you write the literal character. `/[\&&]/v` is clean because the escape separates the pair,
// while `/[\&\&]/v` reports once: the second escape is redundant once the first has done the
// separating.
//
// # This is a fix rather than a suggestion
//
// Deleting the backslash from an escape the language did not need cannot change what the code
// means, because "the language did not need it" is precisely the predicate the rule computes. That
// is the fix-versus-suggestion line: a fix preserves meaning and the engine applies it unattended.
// It is also why the predicate has to be exactly right rather than approximately right, and why the
// fixtures assert the rewritten source rather than the finding count. A count-only fixture passes
// for a fix that writes the right character at the wrong offset, which here would eat the character
// before the backslash and leave the backslash standing.
//
// # Why this does not use regexpattern.Walk
//
// The shelf holds a pattern walker and it is the wrong shape for this rule, in three ways that its
// two shipped callers do not feel. It skips every escape that matches a set rather than a single
// character, so `\p`, `\q`, `\k` and `\B` never arrive, and each of those is a case this rule has to
// answer. It reports `ClassDepth` but not which class, and both the caret and hyphen rules need the
// class's own start and end. And it does not recurse into a `v`-flag nested class, so
// `/[[\.&]--[\.&]]/v` walks to silence where upstream reports twice, measured directly rather than
// read off the source.
//
// That package's own doc anticipates this: a third caller wanting more structure should extend it
// rather than find it half-built. Extending it would change the contract for `no-regex-spaces` and
// `no-control-regex`, which is a larger change than this rule justifies, so the escape scan here is
// built on the layer underneath instead. `regexsyntax.SkipPatternEscape` and `regexsyntax.ClassEnd`
// are the primitives that answer where an escape ends and where a class ends, `v`-flag nesting and
// multi-byte identity escapes included, and both are used rather than reimplemented.
//
// # A JSX attribute is not this rule's surface
//
// `<foo attr="\d"/>` is silent and `<foo attr={"\d"}/>` reports. The first is JSX attribute text,
// where a backslash is a literal backslash and the language never read it as an escape, so there is
// nothing useless about it. The second is a real string literal that merely sits inside JSX. The
// difference is visible as the literal's parent and nothing else.
