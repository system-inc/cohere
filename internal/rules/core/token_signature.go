// Package core ports ESLint's own core rules, the ones that guard JavaScript rather than any
// convention of ours.
//
// These rules carry no house style. They catch code that reads as a mistake in any codebase: a
// switch arm that can never run, a binding whose scope is wider than its initialization, a catch
// that does nothing but hand the error back. Porting them here rather than leaving them to a
// JavaScript linter is the whole point of the tool, since a rule living inside the checker costs
// a walk that already happened.

// tokenSignature renders an expression as a string that is equal for two expressions exactly when
// they are written the same way, ignoring comments and whitespace.
//
// This is our answer to ESLint's `equalTokens`, which compares two nodes token by token against the
// source text. We cannot borrow that shape directly, because it needs a token stream and
// typescript-go hands us a tree whose ForEachChild deliberately skips punctuation: `a.b` yields two
// identifiers and no dot, and a PrefixUnaryExpression yields its operand while its operator lives in
// a struct field the walk never visits. A signature built from child nodes alone therefore reads
// `-1` and `+1` as the same expression, which is a false finding on code that is correct.
//
// So the signature is built from both halves of what the parser knows. Each node contributes its
// kind, which is ESLint's node-type check and also recovers every operator the walk dropped, since
// the operator is what distinguishes one kind from another wherever a kind carries only one. Then
// the gaps between children are scanned for the punctuation that sits in them, which recovers the
// rest: the dot in `a.b`, the `?.` that makes it a different expression, the parentheses and commas
// of a call.
//
// Scanning the gaps rather than the whole node is what keeps regular expressions and strings intact.
// A scanner run over `case /[/*]/` from the start would have to decide whether a slash opens a regex
// or divides, and it decides wrong without the parser's context; a string containing `/* b */` would
// lose its middle to comment-stripping. A leaf keeps its own source text verbatim instead, so the
// literal is compared as the parser saw it, and only the punctuation between nodes, which cannot be
// a literal, is ever re-scanned.
