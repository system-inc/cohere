	// branches have to be used forms, because either one can be the branch that runs.

	// AllowTaggedTemplates tolerates ``tag`text` ``, where the tag is a call and may well have an
	// effect. The untagged template `` `text` `` is unaffected and keeps reporting, since it only
	// ever builds a string.
	AllowTaggedTemplates bool `json:"allowTaggedTemplates"`

	// both upstreams because an element expression is a common intermediate while editing.

	// IgnoreDirectives is inert in this port and deliberately so.
	//
	// ESLint runs two directive checks: one reading the parser's own `.directive` flag, applied
	// always, and a structural re-derivation applied only under this option. The two agree on every
	// input, so the option changes nothing there either. This port has the structural check alone
	// and applies it unconditionally, which reaches the same verdict by one road instead of two.

//
// The directive exemption is the one piece with no counterpart in oxc's rule file. oxc's parser
// hoists a directive prologue into a separate vector on the enclosing body, so a real directive
// never reaches its listener at all and its `ignore_directives` option is unreachable. TypeScript's
// parser leaves directives as ordinary expression statements, so without the exemption written here
// every `'use client'` at the top of a component file would report.
