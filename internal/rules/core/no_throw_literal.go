// # This is the SYNTACTIC sibling of typescript/only-throw-error, not a duplicate of it
//
// Both rules exist upstream and both are ported here. `only-throw-error` asks the type checker what
// the thrown expression's type is, so it can tell `throw someError` from `throw someString` when
// both are identifiers. This one has no types at all: an identifier is "could be an Error" purely
// because it might hold one, which is why `throw a;` is clean here and can report there.
//
// The consequence is that this rule is strictly the weaker of the two on identifiers and is not
// subsumed by it, because it fires on shapes that need no types to condemn.
//
// # The judgment is `couldBeError`, and it is optimistic by construction
//
// Upstream asks whether the argument has ANY possibility of being an Error and reports only when it
// provably cannot be. Eight node types answer yes outright because their value is not knowable
// syntactically, and everything else is either recursion or a no.
//
// The recursion is where the corpus does its work, and each arm is a separate decision:
//
//	=  and &&=   the result is the right operand           throw foo = new Error()  is CLEAN
//	||= and ??=  the result is either operand              throw foo.bar ||= 'literal'  is CLEAN
//	other  op=   arithmetic or bitwise, so a primitive     throw foo += new Error()  REPORTS
//	comma        the result is the last expression         throw new Error(), 1, 2, 3  REPORTS
//	&&           short-circuits to a falsy left, so only   throw 'literal' && new Error()  is CLEAN
//	             the right operand can be the value        throw foo && 'literal'  REPORTS
//	|| and ??    either operand can be the value           throw new Error() || 'literal'  is CLEAN
//	?:           either branch can be the value            throw foo ? 'x' : 'y'  REPORTS
//
// `throw foo += new Error()` reporting while `throw foo = new Error()` is clean is the pair that
// makes the operator split load-bearing rather than decorative, and both are upstream's own cases.
//
// # Our tree folds four of upstream's node types into one
//
// Measured by probing the parse of every corpus case: typescript-go gives `KindBinaryExpression` to
// assignment, comma, and the logical operators alike, discriminating them by the operator token
// rather than by the node kind. Upstream reads three different node types there. So the arms below
// are keyed on the operator token, and the three families are separated inside one case rather than
// by three cases.
//
// `ChainExpression` has no counterpart at all: `obj?.foo` parses as a plain property access and
// `obj?.foo()` as a plain call, so both are already answered by the accessor arms and upstream's
// dedicated case has nothing to map onto. Measured rather than assumed.
//
// # `undefined` gets its own message, and only as a bare global identifier
//
// An identifier is "could be an Error", so `throw undefined` reaches the second test rather than the
// first. It reports `undef` only when the name resolves to the global; upstream asks
// `isGlobalReference` and the corpus pins it with `function foo(undefined) { throw undefined; }`,
// which is CLEAN because the parameter shadows the global and could hold anything.
