	Description: "Duplicate case label: an earlier arm in this switch tests the same expression, so " +
		"this one can never run. Almost always a clause was copied and its test never updated, which " +
		"means the body here is dead and the case it was meant to handle falls through to `default`. " +
		"Change the test to the value this arm was written for, or delete the arm.",
}

// NoDuplicateCase flags a `case` whose test is written the same way as an earlier one in the same
// switch.
//
//	valid:   switch (a) { case 1: break; case 2: break; }
//	valid:   switch (a) { case 1: break; case '1': break; }
//	valid:   switch (a) { case one: break; case 2: break; }
//	invalid: switch (a) { case 1: break; case 1: break; }
//
// The second arm is unreachable, because a switch takes the first arm that matches. That is a
// mistake in every codebase, which is why this rule carries no configuration.
//
// Comparison is by how the test is written, not by what it evaluates to. `case 1` and `case one`
// stay distinct even where `one` is 1, and `case 1` and `case '1'` stay distinct because a switch
// compares with `===`. Going the other way, by value, would need the test expressions evaluated,
// which a linter cannot do and which would be wrong anyway for a test that has side effects.
//
// The rule is deliberately silent about `default`, which has no test and so cannot duplicate one.
// A switch with two `default` clauses is a syntax error the parser already refuses.
//
// Divergence from ESLint, both in our favor and both worth knowing:
//
//   - ESLint reports the whole `SwitchCase` node, which spans the clause body. We report the test
//     expression, because the body is not what is wrong and a finding whose range covers fifty
//     lines is one a reader has to hunt through. The message names the defect precisely enough that
//     the narrower range loses nothing.
//   - ESLint parses to ESTree, which does not keep ParenthesizedExpression, so `case (1)` and
//     `case 1` are one expression there and two here. Ours is the stricter reading; it can only miss
//     a duplicate that was written with different parentheses, never invent one.
//
// No fix. Which arm is the mistake and what its test should have been is the author's knowledge,
// and deleting the wrong one deletes a body that was meant to run.
