// # What counts as a root
//
// Three places accept a declaration: the program itself, the body block of a function, and a class
// static block. An export declaration wrapping one counts too, because the declaration is still at
// the root and the export is not a block. Everything else is a nested block, including a bare block
// with no statement attached to it.
//
// The parent test is deliberately two-step. A block is a legal home only when the block itself is a
// FUNCTION BODY, so `function f() { function g() {} }` is clean while `{ function g() {} }` is not,
// and both spell the parent `Block`. A single-step check on the parent kind would accept every bare
// block in the tree.
//
// # Where the finding says to move it, and why that is a walk
//
// The message names the nearest enclosing place a declaration is allowed, which upstream finds by
// walking up until it meets a static block or a function and calling everything else "program".
// The three answers are the three roots, and getting this wrong renders a grammatical sentence
// pointing at the wrong scope, which no message id assertion can see.
//
// # The strictness gate, which is why this rule is quiet on a modern tree
//
// A function declaration inside a block is block scoped in strict code from ES2015 onward, so
// upstream's default `blockScopedFunctions: "allow"` exempts it there. Every module is strict and
// so is every class body, so on a codebase of ES modules the function half of this rule reports
// almost nothing under its defaults. That is not this port going quiet, and the seeded probe tree
// distinguishes the two.
//
// Strictness is computed here rather than read off a scope table, since we have no scope table.
// Three sources, matching what the language says:
//
//	an external module        every module is strict, and IsExternalModule answers it
//	a class body              a class body is strict, including a static block
//	a directive prologue      a `'use strict'` at the top of the program, or at the top of any
//	                          enclosing function body
//
// Upstream reads `sourceCode.getScope(node).upper.isStrict`, which is the same question its scope
// analysis has already answered. The corpus varies `sourceType` and `ecmaVersion` case by case to
// exercise it, and those cases are reproduced by writing the directive or the export into the
// source rather than by configuring the harness, which cannot vary either.
