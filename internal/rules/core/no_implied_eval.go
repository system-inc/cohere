// A string handed to `setTimeout` is compiled and run, so it is `eval` with a delay: the same
// injection surface, the same loss of scope, and none of it visible to a reader who sees a
// function-shaped call. The name is upstream's and it is exact.
//
// # What decides a report, and why the global test is the whole rule
//
// Two questions have to agree. The callee has to be one of three functions, and it has to be THE
// global one rather than a local of the same name. The second question is not a detail: a helper
// named `setTimeout` taking a string is ordinary code, and reporting it is a false positive on
// something that never runs a string. Upstream answers it with `isGlobalReference` over
// `eslint-scope`, which is a scope analysis rather than a spelling test, and its corpus spends
// twelve valid cases on shadows alone.
//
// The checker answers the same question directly, so this asks it directly. See
// `impliedEvalResolvesToAGlobal` for the predicate and for the case that made it the complement of
// the obvious one.
//
// # The argument test, and the boundary that was measured rather than assumed
//
// Upstream runs two tests over the first argument and reports if either passes. The first is
// syntactic, `isEvaluatedString`: a string literal, a template literal, or a `+` whose either side
// is one of those, recursively. The second is `getStaticValue` from eslint-utils, a constant
// expression evaluator roughly 786 lines long that follows `const` bindings, evaluates about a
// hundred whitelisted builtin calls, and folds conditionals.
//
// This port carries the first and not the second, and the boundary was measured rather than
// guessed. Neutering `getStaticValue` in upstream's own rule and replaying all 175 corpus cases
// through the installed eslint 10.8.1 moves exactly two verdicts, both invalid cases, and no valid
// case at all:
//
//	const s = 'x=1'; setTimeout(s, 100);   reports upstream, silent here
//	setTimeout(String('x=1'), 100);        reports upstream, silent here
//
// So the evaluator buys two findings for roughly 786 lines plus a hundred-entry runtime whitelist
// whose entries are JavaScript function identities rather than names. Both divergences are toward
// silence, which is the safe direction for a rule with no repair, and both are pinned as tests in
// this rule's own file so the gap is a recorded decision rather than an omission. Neither shape
// occurs anywhere in the tree; see the rule's test for that count.
//
// The syntactic test is not a subset of the evaluator, which is why it is the half worth keeping:
// `setTimeout('foo' + bar)` has no static value at all and upstream still reports it, because one
// side being a string makes the whole concatenation a string whatever the other side holds.
//
// # Cost
//
// The checker is asked only after the callee's name has already matched one of three spellings, so
// the question is asked on almost no files. The per-file lock is taken once rather than per node.

// TypeScript standard library declares both. It cannot be reused here, and the reason was measured
// rather than reasoned about. Probed against the checker in `internal/no_implied_eval_core_probe`:
//
//	setTimeout    symbol found, 1 declaration, in a declaration file
//	setInterval   symbol found, 1 declaration, in a declaration file
//	window        symbol found, 1 declaration, in a declaration file
//	self          symbol found, 1 declaration, in a declaration file
//	globalThis    symbol found, ZERO declarations
//	execScript    no symbol at all
//	global        no symbol at all
//
// The last three are the problem. `globalThis` is a real global whose symbol carries no
// declarations, so a declaration-file test answers false on it and the rule goes silent on every
// `globalThis.setTimeout('s')` while its fixtures pass. `execScript` is not in any TypeScript lib
// at all, and neither is `global` without the node types, so both resolve to nothing while
// upstream reports both. Three of upstream's four global-object candidates and one of its three
// function names fail a declaration-file test.
//
// So the question is inverted: rather than proving the name is the global, ask whether anything in
// SOURCE declares it, and treat "nothing does" as the global. That answers all seven names above
// correctly, and it answers the shadows correctly too, which is the direction that matters, since a
// shadow is by definition written in source.
//
// The conservative direction is the opposite one from the neighbour's, and deliberately so. An
// unresolvable name answers "global" here, where the neighbour answers "not global". That is
// upstream's behaviour: `execScript` resolves to nothing in any TypeScript program and upstream
// reports it in twenty-one corpus cases, so declining an unresolved name would lose all of them.
