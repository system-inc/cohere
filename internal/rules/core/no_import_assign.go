//
// An import binding is not a variable holding a copy. It is a live, immutable view of the exporting
// module's own binding, so the assignment has nowhere to write. Module code is always strict, so
// there is no sloppy mode in which the write is merely ignored: it throws a TypeError at the line
// that makes it. TypeScript catches most of these already, which is the reason this rule is worth
// less in a typed tree than in a plain one; it does not catch the `Object.assign` family, which is
// the case this rule is here for.
//
// # Three shapes, and only the first is a rebinding
//
// Rebinding the local name (`mod = 0`) fails for any import. Writing to a property of a namespace
// object (`mod.named = 0`) fails only for `import * as`, because only that shape produces a module
// namespace exotic object, which is sealed and whose properties are non-configurable and
// non-writable. A default or named import is an ordinary value, so `mod.prop = 0` mutates whatever
// the module exported and is upstream's very first clean case. Passing a namespace object as the
// first argument of a well-known mutation function (`Object.assign(mod, obj)`) is the same seal
// reached through a different door, and it is the one shape a type checker does not catch, since the
// signature of `Object.assign` accepts it happily.
//
// # Why this reads the checker
//
// The discrimination is name resolution, and three of upstream's clean cases are written to prove
// it. `import mod from 'mod'; { let mod = 0; mod = 1 }` writes to a local spelled exactly like the
// import; so does the namespace form, and so does its member variant. Their text is identical to the
// failing shapes and only the binding differs, so a rule matching on the name reports all three.
//
// Upstream answers with `get_resolved_references`, a find-all-references index we do not have. The
// question our checker does answer is which declaration a given identifier binds to, so this anchors
// on the import declaration the listener already received and asks, for each write in the file,
// whether the resolved symbol's first declaration is one of that declaration's own specifier nodes.
//
// Node identity rather than declaration kind. A shadow inside a block is a `KindVariableDeclaration`
// and the anchor is a `KindImportSpecifier`, so kind looks sufficient here and is not: two imports
// in the same file both declare at `KindImportSpecifier`, and a kind test would let a write to one
// be attributed to the other. `import {a} from 'x'; import {b} from 'y'; b = 0` would then report
// twice, once per declaration, where upstream reports once. Identity separates them and kind cannot.
//
// # Why the checker is not sufficient on its own
//
// Symbol identity says which binding an identifier names and nothing about whether the occurrence
// writes. `mod.prop = 0` and `foo(mod)` both resolve to the import and neither rebinds it, so the
// rule needs the structural half too. For the plain rebinding that is a straight conjunction and
// `reference.WritesToBinding` is the structural half, shared with five sibling rules.
//
// The namespace shapes are where the two halves are not a simple conjunction, which is the thing
// that makes this rule bigger than its sibling. `mod.named = 0` does not write to `mod` by that
// test, and correctly so, since the same test has to keep `mod.prop = 0` clean for a default import.
// The write being flagged is a write to a property of the thing the identifier names, so the
// structural question is asked one level up: is the member expression whose object is this
// identifier the target of an assignment, an update, a delete, or a for-in/of head. That is
// `writesThroughMemberExpression`, and it is a different question from `reference.WritesToBinding`
// rather than a variant of it.
//
// # What upstream misses and this reproduces
//
// `import * as mod from 'mod'; obj[mod] = 0` is clean upstream and clean here: `mod` is the computed
// key, not the object, so nothing about the namespace is written. So is
// `Object.assign(obj, mod, other)`, since only the first argument is mutated. Both are upstream
// telling a porter which near misses it decided against, and both have a fixture.
//
// The one place this port is narrower than the corpus suggests: upstream's `Object` guard asks
// whether the name has any binding at all, which is a scope question. This asks the checker where
// `Object` is declared and requires the declaration to come from a library file rather than from the
// file being linted. Measured on upstream's own two clean cases for it, which shadow `Object` with a
// `var` in and out of a block, and both stay clean.
//
// No fix. The repair is to change the exporting module or to introduce a local, and the rule cannot
// know which was meant.
