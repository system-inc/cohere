// The two upstream reporting cases that are clean here, and the reason is not this rule.

// Upstream reports `this.alert(foo)` at the top level of a SCRIPT, where `this` is the global
// object. Our harness pins `moduleDetection: "force"` in `internal/ruletest/program.go` and our tree
// is modules throughout, and in a module top-level `this` is `undefined` rather than the global.
//
// Measured on the installed rule rather than reasoned about: with `sourceType: "module"` both of
// these come back CLEAN from upstream itself, and with `sourceType: "script"` both report. So this
// is not a divergence in the port at all, it is the same rule reaching the same verdict about a
// different kind of file, and no fixture in this tree can express the reporting half because the
// tree cannot produce a script.
//
// Recorded as passing cases with the measurement rather than deleted, so the next reader does not
// read the missing `this` arm as an oversight and helpfully add one. The control is `window.alert`,
// which reports in both source types.

// Two upstream CLEAN cases that report here, and the discriminator is the language version.
//
// `globalThis.alert();` appears in upstream's corpus twice, once in each list, with identical source
// text. The only difference is `ecmaVersion`: the clean copies are pinned to the default and to
// 2017, and the reporting copy to 2020. Upstream's `isGlobalThisReferenceOrGlobalWindow` asks the
// scope whether a variable named `globalThis` exists, which is how it detects an environment old
// enough not to have one, and below ES2020 the answer is no.
//
// Driven on the installed rule across versions to fix this rather than infer it:
//
//	ecmaVersion=2017  globalThis.alert();       CLEAN
//	ecmaVersion=2020  globalThis.alert();       unexpected
//	ecmaVersion=2022  globalThis.alert();       unexpected
//	ecmaVersion=6     globalThis["alert"]();    CLEAN
//	ecmaVersion=2022  globalThis["alert"]();    unexpected
//
// `internal/ruletest/program.go` pins `target: "ES2022"` and our tree compiles to the same, so
// `globalThis` is always in the standard library the checker reads and the pre-2020 verdict is not
// reachable here. Reporting these is therefore agreement with upstream AT OUR TARGET rather than a
// divergence from it, and a port reproducing them as clean would be silent on the modern spelling of
// the exact thing this rule exists to catch.
