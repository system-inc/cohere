// The corpus is ESLint's own, copied rather than rewritten.
//
// Every case below is verbatim from `eslint/tests/lib/rules/no-octal-escape.js`: 34 pass and 60
// fail, and every failing case names exactly one `octalEscapeSequence`, so one finding per input is
// stated by the corpus rather than assumed. The cases were lifted by evaluating that test file with
// its `RuleTester` stubbed and serialising the spec object it was handed, so the strings here are
// the ones upstream runs rather than a retyping of them, and the sequence beside each failing case
// is upstream's own `data.sequence`.
//
// Upstream runs this corpus at `ecmaVersion: 5` with `sourceType: "script"`, because a legacy octal
// escape is a syntax error in a module and ESLint would report a parse failure instead of the rule.
// Our parser has no such gate: measured over all 94 cases, 93 produce exactly one string literal in
// a `.ts` file and the parser cooks the escape rather than refusing it. The one that produces none
// is `var foo = /([abc]) \1/g;`, a regular expression, which upstream also declines through its
// `typeof value !== "string"` test. So the whole corpus is expressible here, and the correspondence
// was measured rather than hoped for.
//
// Copied because a fixture a porter invents encodes the same belief as the port, and the case that
// catches a bug is the one nobody would think to write.

//
// The parity group (`'\\1'`, `'\\01'`, `'\\12'`, `'\\\0'`, `'\\\8'`, `'\0\\'`) is why the walk steps in
// escape-sized units rather than searching for a backslash: in each of these the backslash before
// the digits is itself escaped, so the digits are plain text. A rule scanning for a backslash
// followed by a digit reports all of them.
//
// The bare-null group (`'\0'` and its neighbours with text on either side) pins that `\0` alone is
// the legal null character rather than an octal escape. It is the reason the single-digit
// production is `[1-7]` and excludes zero, and the reason `0(?=[89])` has to be written separately.
//
// The decimal group (`'\8'`, `'\9'`, `'a\8a'`, `'\80'`, `'\81'`) is a different rule's surface:
// `\8` and `\9` are legacy decimal escapes, which no-nonoctal-decimal-escape covers. Reading them
// as octal would report on a sibling rule's cases. Note `'\80'` and `'\81'` are clean while `'\08'`
// reports, which looks backwards until you read the productions: the leading digit is what decides.
//
// The no-escape group (`'0'`, `'01'`, `'08'`, `'12'`) is digits with no backslash at all, and
// `'\x51'`, `'\a'`, `'\n'` are escapes that are not numeric.
