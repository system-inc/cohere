// NoDivRegex flags a regular expression literal whose pattern begins with an equals sign.
//
//	valid:   /foo/ig
//	valid:   /\=foo/         // the equals sign is escaped, so the first character is a backslash
//	valid:   /[=]foo/        // already the repair
//	valid:   '=foo'          // a string, not a regular expression
//	invalid: /=foo/          // fixed to /[=]foo/
//	invalid: /=/
//	invalid: /=foo/g
//
// # The test is positional, and that is the whole rule
//
// Upstream takes the literal's first token and asks whether `token.value[1] === "="`. Index 1 is
// the character right after the opening slash, so this is a question about the second byte of the
// token text and nothing else. It is not a question about what the pattern matches: `/(=)/` and
// `/[=]foo/` both match an equals sign and both are clean, while `/==/` reports; all three
// measured against the installed ESLint build.
//
// So no regular expression parse is involved and none should be. A port that walked the pattern
// and asked whether the first element can match `=` would report `/[=]foo/`, which is the repair
// this rule proposes, and upstream's own clean case.
//
// The escape case falls out of the same positional reading rather than needing its own branch:
// in `/\=foo/` the character at index 1 is a backslash, so the test fails. That is upstream's
// second clean case.
//
// # The repair rewrites one byte and is a fix rather than a suggestion
//
// Upstream replaces the range `[start+1, start+2)` with `[=]`, which turns `/=foo/` into
// `/[=]foo/`. A one-member character class matches exactly the character it names, so the pattern
// accepts the same input before and after and there is no second valid answer to pick between.
// That is what makes it a fix the engine may apply unattended rather than a suggestion needing an
// author, and it is the same reasoning `no-regex-spaces` records for its own repair.
//
// The span of the FINDING is the whole literal including its flags, which upstream's corpus states
// as columns 29 through 35 for `/=foo/`. The span of the FIX is the single equals sign. Those
// differ deliberately, and asserting only the first would not notice a repair that rewrote the
// wrong byte, which is why the tests assert the rewritten source rather than the fix text.
//
// # Only a literal, never a constructor
//
// Upstream reads the first TOKEN of the node and requires its type to be `RegularExpression`, so
// `new RegExp('=foo')` never qualifies: its first token is `new`. Measured, that input is clean.
// Here the listener key is the regular expression kind, which asks the same question at the parser
// instead. `no-regex-spaces` handles both spellings and this one does not, and the difference is
// upstream's rather than an omission.

				// yielding a one-byte literal holding just the opening slash, among them
				// `var a = /;` and a file truncated mid-pattern. Indexing byte 1 of one of those
