// negativeZeroComparisonOperators is every operator ESLint's original checks for, mapped to the
// text the message quotes back.
//
// A map rather than a switch because the lookup answers two questions at once: whether this binary
// expression is a comparison the rule cares about, and what to call it in the message. `in`,
// `instanceof`, and every arithmetic operator are absent on purpose, so `x ** -0` and `x + -0` are
// not comparisons and do not report.

	ast.KindGreaterThanToken:             ">",

// NoCompareNegZero flags a comparison against the literal `-0`.

//	valid:   x === 0
//	valid:   Object.is(x, -0)
//	valid:   x === -1
//	valid:   x === -0n
//	invalid: x === -0
//	invalid: -0 > x
//
// Every comparison operator in JavaScript treats `-0` and `+0` as the same number, so `x === -0` is
// true for `0` as well and `x < -0` is false for both. The comparison therefore does not test what
// its author wrote it to test: it reads as a check for negative zero and is not one. The only thing
// that distinguishes the two is `Object.is(x, -0)`, which is what the author almost certainly meant.
//
// The relational operators are included alongside the equality ones for the same reason, even though
// `x < -0` looks less like a negative-zero test. Writing `-0` there still signals an intent the
// operator cannot carry, and the `-` is either meaningless or a typo for a different number.
//
// What counts as `-0` is a unary minus applied to a numeric literal whose value is zero, so
// `-0.0`, `-0x0`, and `-0e10` all report: they are the same number written differently, and the
// hazard is in the value rather than the spelling. Parentheses are transparent on both the unary
// expression and its operand, matching ESLint, whose ESTree has no node for them.
//
// A BigInt `-0n` is exempt, and not as an oversight. BigInt has no negative zero at all: `-0n` is
// `0n`, so the comparison behaves exactly as written and there is nothing to warn about. TypeScript's
// `-0 as number` and `-0 satisfies number` are also exempt, following ESLint, whose parser does not
// see the assertion but whose reading of the shape is the one we match: the operand of the minus has
// to be the numeric literal itself, and in those the minus applies to an expression.
//
// Reported on the whole comparison rather than on the `-0` operand, which is ESLint's range and the
// right one here: the defect is the comparison, not the literal, and `Object.is` replaces all of it.
//
// No fix. `Object.is(x, -0)` is the likely intent but not the certain one, since an author who
// wrote `x < -0` may have meant `x < 0`, and a rewrite that guessed would silently change a
// condition.

// would need every base parsed by hand to close holes this AST does not have.
