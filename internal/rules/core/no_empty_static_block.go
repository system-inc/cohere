		"where that is deliberate: a static block has no parameter to bind and no error to " +

//
// A comment inside the block satisfies the rule, matching how `no-empty` treats its blocks: the
// point is that a reader can tell a deliberate no-op from an accident, and a comment is what makes
// that distinction visible. Consistency with the sibling rule matters more than the marginal
// strictness of rejecting the comment form.
//
// No fix. Removing the block is usually right and occasionally wrong, since a static block is also
// where someone parks work they are about to write, and this rule cannot tell which case it found.
