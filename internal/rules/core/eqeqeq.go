//
// # Why this matters more than it looks
//
// `==` applies the abstract equality algorithm, which coerces across types before comparing, so
// `0 == '0'`, `0 == []` and an empty string against `false` are all true while `'0' == []` is false. The result is a
// relation that is not transitive, which is the property every reader unconsciously assumes a
// comparison has. `===` compares without coercion and is transitive.
//
// # The repair is a fix sometimes and a suggestion otherwise, and that split IS the rule
//
// Changing `==` to `===` changes what the code DOES wherever the operands can differ in type, so
// applying it unattended could turn a passing comparison into a failing one. Upstream draws the line
// where it can prove coercion is impossible:
//
//	either operand is a `typeof`     the result is always a string, so both sides are strings
//	both operands are literals       of the same `typeof` class, so no coercion can occur
//
// Those get a real Fix, applied unattended. Everything else gets a Suggestion, which a human
// chooses. Twenty of upstream's cases carry a fix and twenty-eight carry a suggestion, and no case
// carries both. Shipping the suggestion arm as a fix would let the edit engine change program
// behaviour on `a == b`, which is the single worst thing a linter can do.
//
// # `null` is its own axis
//
// `x == null` is the idiomatic test for "null or undefined", so it is broken out as a separate
// option rather than folded into the general judgment. Under `Null: Never` the rule INVERTS for
// null, reporting `x === null` and asking for `==` -- the only configuration in which this rule
// reports an identity operator at all.
//
// # Parentheses
//
// All three predicates see through them, and that is fidelity rather than a widening: espree gives a
// parenthesized expression no node, so upstream's direct field reads already look past them.
// Measured against the installed build -- `(typeof a) == 'number'` and `(1) == (2)` both take the
// FIX arm, and `x == (null)` takes the null arm. Reading the operands directly would put all three
// on the wrong arm while every unparenthesized case stayed green.
