		"putting a cursor on it. Three spaces and four look the same in every editor, so the " +
		"pattern silently stops matching the moment someone deletes one, and the diff that did it " +

		"intent readable and makes an accidental edit visible.",

// NoRegexSpaces flags a run of two or more literal spaces in a regular expression.
//
//	valid:   /foo {3}bar/
//	valid:   /  +/           // the run is quantified, so it means something other than a count
//	valid:   /[  ]/          // inside a class, where repetition is not what the spaces do
//	valid:   /bar  baz/
//	valid:   new RegExp('  ', flags)   // flags unknown, so the parse is unknown
//	invalid: /foo   bar/
//	invalid: new RegExp('foo   bar')
//
// Three things about this rule are easy to get backwards, and each is a real defect if you do.
//
// **At most one finding per regex, and it is the FIRST qualifying run, not the last.** Upstream's
// accumulator is named `last_space_span` and does not hold the last run: once a run of two or more
// has latched, every later run is discarded, and the single space bookkeeping exists only to step
// past lone spaces on the way to the first real one. So `/  foo   /` reports the leading pair and
// says nothing about the trailing three. That is why upstream's corpus is 26 inputs and 26
// diagnostics: no input can report twice, by construction rather than by coincidence. Reading the
// field name and tracking the last run instead passes 25 of the 26 imported cases.
//
// **Depth is the whole discrimination and it is checked on the character, not the pattern.** A
// space inside a quantifier or a character class is not a run somebody lost count of: `/  +/` is
// one space repeated and `/[  ]/` is a set that happens to name the space twice. The walk carries
// both depths so this rule can skip either, which is the case `regexpattern` was built for.
//
// **The constructor path parses the COOKED string but reports RAW offsets, and it needs both.** For
// a regex literal the two texts are the same and none of this arises. For the constructor they are
// not, and each half is load bearing in a different direction.
//
// The parse has to be cooked because that is the string the RegExp constructor receives. In
// `new RegExp(' \\[   ')` the `\\[` is a JS string escape, so the pattern the engine sees is ` [   `,
// which opens a character class that never closes. Parsing the raw bytes instead reads `\\[` as a
// regex escape, finds no class, and reports three spaces that upstream and ESLint both call clean.
//
// The span has to be raw because that is what indexes the file. `new RegExp('\\\\d  ')` has a raw body
// one byte longer than its cooked value, so a cooked offset applied to the file points one byte
// short, and the fix would eat a character it did not mean to.
//
// oxc gets both at once by running its reader in string-literal mode, cooking while carrying each
// unit's original span. We have no such reader, so `literal.CookedToRaw` rebuilds the correspondence
// instead. ESLint takes the third route: it computes against the cooked value and then refuses the
// fix whenever cooked and raw differ, so it reports those cases without repairing them. Ours
// repairs them, which is upstream's behavior rather than ESLint's.
//
// # Where this deliberately differs from oxc
//
// oxc hardcodes a nil flags text into its constructor parser, so the `v` flag never reaches the
// parse on that path and nested classes are not honored there. Its own snapshot shows the
// consequence: `/[[    ]    ]    /v` reports the trailing run and
// `new RegExp('[[    ]    ]    ', 'v')` reports a run five bytes earlier, inside the nested class,
// though the two spell one regex. Its fix vector bakes that in, so copying its fixtures would
// import the bug together with the fixture that blesses it.
//
// We pass the real flags on both paths, so the two spellings agree, which is also what ESLint does
// for both. This is rule-local rather than a house pattern upstream follows: of oxc's three rules
// using that parser, only this one withholds the flags.
//
// The repair is a fix rather than a suggestion because it cannot change what the pattern matches: a
// run of n spaces and ` {n}` accept exactly the same input, and there is no second valid answer to
// choose between.
//
// A pattern the scanner cannot make sense of is skipped rather than reported, matching upstream and
// for the same reason as the sibling regex rules: an unterminated construct is a syntax error the
// parser has already refused, so a second complaint here is noise on a file that does not compile.
