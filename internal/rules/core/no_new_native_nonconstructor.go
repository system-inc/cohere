//
// Both are functions that produce a primitive and both throw a TypeError under `new`, so this is a
// crash rather than a style preference: the code never worked and the failure is at the call.
//
// # This is the first hand-written rule to read the checker, and why it must
//
// Six of the ten valid cases above are the same shape: a local binding named `Symbol` or `BigInt`
// that shadows the global. `new Symbol()` inside a function taking `Symbol` as a parameter
// constructs whatever that parameter holds, which may be perfectly constructible, and reporting it
// is a false positive on correct code.
//
// Upstream answers this with `root_unresolved_references()`, which is a scope analysis rather than a
// spelling test. **There is no structural answer.** The shadow can be a parameter, a function
// declaration, an import, or a `var` anywhere in an enclosing scope, so no bounded walk finds it:
// `no-ex-assign` gets away with name matching only because a catch clause gives it a subtree to
// stop at, and this has none.
//
// The predicate is where the name's declaration lives. A global comes from a declaration file, since
// `Symbol` and `BigInt` are declared in the TypeScript standard library; a shadow comes from source.
// That is `IsDeclarationFile` on the declaration's own file, which is the checker's answer to
// upstream's question rather than an approximation of it.
//
// Measured on all ten of upstream's valid cases and all four invalid ones before this was written,
// with a probe reporting which side each landed on.
//
// # Cost
//
// Declaring `NeedsTypeChecker` takes an exclusive per-file lock, and it is the only hand-written
// rule that does. The lock is acquired once per file rather than per node, and this rule asks the
// checker only for a `new` expression whose callee is one of two identifiers, so the question is
// asked on almost no files in a normal tree.
