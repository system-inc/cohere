//	valid:   obj.foo.apply(otherObj, [1, 2]);
//	valid:   foo.apply(null, args);
//	valid:   var call; foo[call](null, 1, 2);
//	invalid: foo.call(undefined, 1, 2);
//	invalid: obj.foo.apply(obj, [1, 2]);
//	invalid: [].concat.apply([ ], [1, 2]);
//
// # Two shapes, and `.apply()` only in its non-variadic form
//
// `.call(thisArg, a, b)` is watched whenever it has at least one argument. `.apply(thisArg, arr)` is
// watched only when it has exactly two arguments AND the second is an array LITERAL, because that is
// the case where the argument list is known at the call site and the rewrite is mechanical.
// `foo.apply(null, args)` is left alone here: the array is not a literal, so removing `.apply()`
// would need spread syntax, and that is `prefer-spread`'s finding rather than this one. The two
// rules deliberately partition the same syntax by whether the second argument is a literal, and each
// rule's doc names the other.
//
// # `computed === false` is required, and it is NOT what the sibling helper does
//
// Upstream requires the property access to be non-computed, so `foo["call"](undefined, 1, 2)` is
// CLEAN. Measured on the installed rule, both for `call` and for `apply`. This package already has
// `isApplyMemberAccess`, written for `prefer-spread`, and it deliberately ACCEPTS a string-literal
// subscript because `foo['apply'](null, args)` is the same call. Reusing it here unchanged would
// report a whole class of input upstream passes, and no imported fixture would catch it because
// upstream's own clean cases for the computed form use a variable key rather than a literal.
//
// So this rule tests the access shape itself rather than borrowing that helper. It is the one place
// in this port where the neighbouring rule's answer is the wrong answer.
//
// # The receiver comparison, and one stated divergence
//
// For a callee reached through a member access, the redundant `this` is the object it was reached
// through, and "the same object" is decided by comparing tokens, which is upstream's `equalTokens`.
// The shelf already holds that oracle as `hasSameTokens`.
//
// One upstream reporting case does not reproduce, and it is the divergence `prefer-spread` already
// records at its own line: `(obj?.foo).bar.call(obj?.foo, 1, 2)`. ESTree has no node for
// parentheses, so upstream reads both sides as the same tokens and reports. Our parser keeps the
// node, and the two expressions are genuinely different: `(obj?.foo).bar` throws when `obj` is null
// while `obj?.foo.bar` short-circuits. Measured with a signature probe over all nine optional-chain
// shapes in the corpus; that one is the only disagreement, and reporting it would be a false
// finding. Recorded as a case that stays silent rather than deleted, so the next reader sees the
// decision instead of a gap.
//
// # No fix
//
// Upstream ships none, and the rewrite is not mechanical: removing `.call(obj, ...)` from
// `a[i++].foo.call(a[i++], 1)` changes how many times the side effect runs, and the array-literal
// `.apply()` form has to be unpacked into an argument list whose spacing carries intent.

// nonComputedMemberName returns the property name of a NON-computed member access.

// Upstream's predicate is `callee.property.type === "Identifier" && callee.computed === false`, and
// the computed half is load-bearing rather than incidental: `foo["call"](undefined, 1, 2)` is clean
// on the installed rule. That is the one place this rule must NOT reuse `isApplyMemberAccess` from
// `prefer-spread`, which accepts a string-literal subscript on purpose.
//
// A private identifier answers false. `foo.#call(undefined, 1, 2)` is a different property that
// merely spells the same word, and it is upstream's own clean case.
//
// That check is SUBSUMED rather than load-bearing, and this is a measurement rather than an
// argument: typescript-go keeps the sigil in the identifier's text, so `#call` compares unequal to
// both `call` and `apply` at the switch below and the access is declined there anyway. Probed
// directly, `foo.#call(...)` yields `kind=KindPrivateIdentifier text="#call"` while `this.call(...)`
// yields `kind=KindIdentifier text="call"`. A mutation removing the guard survived all 49 fixtures,
// which is what sent the probe.
//
// Kept rather than deleted, matching what `prefer-spread` decided about the same shape for the same
// reason: the comparison it guards is against a bare name, and nothing at the call site tells a
// reader that the sigil survives into it. Deleting it would make the next reader re-derive this.
