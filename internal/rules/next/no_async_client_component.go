	Description: "A client component declared as an async function is rendered on the client, " +
		"where React cannot await it the way the server can. The promise it returns is not an " +
		"element, so rendering fails or hydration diverges from what the server produced. Move " +
		"the awaiting into an effect or an event handler and keep the component itself synchronous.",

// NoAsyncClientComponent flags the default export of a `use client` file when it is an async
// function with a capitalized name.
//
//	valid:   "use client"; export default function MyComponent() {}
//	valid:   "use client"; export default async function myFunction() {}
//	valid:   export default async function MyComponent() {}
//	invalid: "use client"; export default async function MyComponent() {}
//	invalid: "use client"; async function MyComponent() {}; export default MyComponent
//	invalid: "use client"; const MyComponent = async () => {}; export default MyComponent
//
// Ported from `@next/next/no-async-client-component`, keying on oxc's implementation.
//
// # The rule does not test componenthood, despite its name
//
// Three of upstream's five failing cases return a string and contain no markup at all, and they
// report. The entire discrimination is a capitalized name bound to an async function that is the
// file's default export, in a file whose prologue carries `use client`. Reaching for a component
// predicate such as `react.EnclosingComponent` here would look like an improvement and would
// silently drop three of the five imported failures.
//
// # What the gate is
//
// A directive, not a path. Several rules in this package gate on which Next.js file a path is, and
// `internal/utilities/nextjs/paths.go` holds two deliberately disagreeing predicates for that question.
// Neither applies here: oxc's `run_once` reads `program.directives` and never consults the path, so
// this rule runs on every file and decides from the prologue alone. Recorded because the shape of
// the neighbours invites the wrong assumption.
//
// # Capitalization is Unicode-aware here, unlike upstream's own react rules
//
// oxc tests `char::is_uppercase`, which accepts non-ASCII. Pinned against the release oxlint
// binary: a client component named `Фoo` reports and one named `фoo` is silent. That makes
// `react.IsLikelyComponentName`, which decodes the first rune and asks `unicode.IsUpper`, an exact
// match for this rule rather than the divergence it is elsewhere. The helper's own doc records an
// open ASCII question because oxc's *component* path uses `is_ascii_uppercase`; this rule is not on
// that path, so the question does not arise and the helper is simply right. The `@next` original
// spells it `/[A-Z]/` and is ASCII-only, so it and oxc disagree on this input. oxc is the port
// target and wins.
//
// # Parenthesized forms are silent, and that is reproduced rather than repaired
//
// oxc destructures an arrow initializer and an exported identifier directly, with no parenthesis
// skipping, so both of these are silent upstream and both are silent here, for free rather than by
// a check. Measured on the release binary, since the corpus writes no parenthesized forms:
//
//	"use client"; const MyThing = (async () => {}); export default MyThing     silent
//	"use client"; async function MyComponent() {}; export default (MyComponent) silent
//
// Our parser gives the first a `KindParenthesizedExpression` initializer, which the kind check
// declines, and the second a parenthesized export expression the checker resolves to no symbol.
// Adding a skip in either place would be a divergence in the direction of reporting more.
//
// No fix. The repair is to remove `async` and rewrite whatever the body awaited, which the rule
// cannot know how to do.

	// The declaration that comes FIRST IN SOURCE ORDER, which is neither a loop nor an index-zero
	// read, and every part of this was measured rather than reasoned.
	//
	// The standing advice in this tree is to loop over `symbol.Declarations` because indexing zero
	// goes silent when declarations merge. That advice is right for a rule anchored on a
	// declaration asking "does any write reach me", where more declarations can only mean more
	// chances to match. It is wrong here, where the question is "what single thing is this name",
	// and it is wrong in both of its halves.
	//
	// First, declarations are NOT in source order in typescript-go. Measured: an
	// `interface MyComponent {}` written above `async function MyComponent() {}` still puts the
	// function at index 0, because a value declaration sorts ahead of a type one no matter where it
	// was written. So the input the loop advice exists to catch does not arise for this shape at
	// all, and a fixture written for it asserts nothing. That is why a mutant replacing the loop
	// with an index-zero read survived a fixture written specifically to kill it.
	//
	// Second, upstream reaches exactly one node, through `symbol_declaration(symbol_id)`, and which
	// node that is depends on source order: oxc's binder records the first declaration it sees. So
	// the rule is order-sensitive upstream, and all four of these were pinned on the release
	// binary:
	//
	//	interface MyComponent {}; async function MyComponent() {}   silent   the interface is first
	//	async function MyComponent() {}; interface MyComponent {}   REPORTS  the function is first
	//	namespace MyComponent {}; async function MyComponent() {}   silent   the namespace is first
	//	let MyThing = async () => {}; namespace MyThing {}          REPORTS  the binding is first
	//
	// A loop reports all four, because one merged declaration is always the async one. An
	// index-zero read reports the first three and is right twice by accident. Sorting by position
	// and taking the earliest reproduces upstream on all four, for the same reason upstream gives
