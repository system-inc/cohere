// Ported from `@next/next/no-duplicate-head`, read against oxc's `no_duplicate_head.rs` and against
// `@next/eslint-plugin-next`'s own `no-duplicate-head.js`. The two sources implement substantially
// different rules and oxc is followed throughout, because oxc is what the gate being replaced runs.
// Every behaviour below was measured on the release oxlint binary rather than inferred, because the
// imported corpus is four cases and pins almost none of it.
//
// # This is not a JSX rule upstream, and that changes what it counts
//
// The name suggests walking JSX and counting elements called `Head`. oxc does not do that. It
// anchors on `ImportDeclaration`, finds the specifier whose local name is `Head`, resolves it to a
// symbol, and walks the semantic reference table counting reads whose parent is a JSX opening
// element. The two mechanisms agree only when every `Head` in the file is both imported and used
// directly as a tag, which is every case the corpus ships, so the corpus cannot tell them apart.
//
// Three consequences follow, and a JSX-counting port gets all three wrong:
//
//   - **The module specifier is never checked.** `import { Head } from './my-own-widgets'` arms the
//     rule exactly as `next/document` does. Measured: reports. This is upstream firing well outside
//     the scope its own message describes, and it is reproduced rather than narrowed, because
//     narrowing it would make us silent on files the gate reports.
//   - **A `Head` that is not an import never counts.** `const Head = () => null` used twice is
//     silent, and so is a `Head` shadowed inside a function while an unused import sits at the root.
//     Both measured.
//   - **A tag that is not a plain identifier never counts.** `<Head.Sub/><Head.Sub/>` is silent,
//     because the reference's parent is the member expression rather than the opening element.
//     Measured, and it is also why the identifier guard below is load-bearing rather than defensive:
//     reading `Text()` off that kind panics.
//
// # Which name matches, and the recorded research had this backwards
//
// oxc reads `specifiers.iter().find(|s| s.name() == "Head")`, and `ImportDeclarationSpecifier::name`
// is defined as `self.local().name` at `oxc_ast/src/ast_impl/js.rs:2034`. It is the **local** name,
// not the imported one. So `import { Head as PageHead } from 'next/document'` with two `<PageHead/>`
// is **silent** (no specifier is locally named `Head`), and `import { Header as Head }` with two
// `<Head/>` **reports** (the local name is `Head`). Both measured on the binary, and both are the
// opposite of what this rule's own research pass recorded from reading the accessor's name. The
// fixtures below pin both directions, because this is the axis nothing upstream tests and the
// intuitive reading is the wrong one.
//
// Matching the local name is also why the specifier's *declaration* is what identity is compared
// against below rather than its imported name: a default import, a namespace import and a named one
// all bind a local `Head`, and all three arm the rule. The namespace form was measured reporting.
//
// # One finding per file, not one per pair and not one per extra copy
//
// oxc accumulates labels and calls `ctx.diagnostic` once, so three copies produce **one** finding
// carrying three underlines and four copies produce one carrying four. Measured on the binary at
// three and at four. This is worth stating because both other readings are natural designs that
// agree with the corpus: the corpus's only multi-copy case is the three-copy fail, and a per-extra
// reading would give it two while a pairwise reading would give it three. `jsx-no-duplicate-props`
// in this tree answers a structurally similar question the *other* way, once per extra occurrence,
// so its shape is worth copying here and its count is not.
//
// Our harness carries one range per finding rather than a label list, so the reported range is the
// first occurrence, which is the position oxc renders as the diagnostic's own: the snapshot for the
// three-copy fail prints `9:19`, the first `<Head`. The range is the tag name alone, four bytes,
// not the element.
//
// # Two element kinds where oxc has one
//
// oxc listens on `JSXOpeningElement` and gets both shapes, because its parser gives a self-closing
// element an opening element carrying a flag. Our parser gives it a distinct `JsxSelfClosingElement`
// containing no opening element, and **every** `<Head />` in the corpus is self-closing, so
// listening on the literal translation of oxc's node would silence one of two fail cases and both
// pass cases while leaving the rule looking implemented.
//
// A closing tag does not count in either tree. `<Head>x</Head>` is one occurrence, measured silent,
// and a pair of them reports with two labels rather than four. Ours falls out of the same shape:
// `KindJsxClosingElement` is not listened on.
//
// # Whole file, any depth, any component
//
// The count spans the file. Two `Head` in two unrelated components report, and so do two nested at
// different depths under different parents. Both measured. ESLint's rule filters the *direct
// children* of one returned element and requires a class extending the `next/document` default
// import, so it is silent on both; that is the sharpest disagreement between the two upstreams and
// oxc's answer is the one taken. The nested case is pinned by a fixture below because nothing
// upstream covers it and the narrower reading is the one a reader expects.
//
// # No path gate exists, and that is upstream's defect reproduced
//
// The message names `pages/_document.js` and the rule runs on every file. Verified twice: the rule
// file contains no `file_path`, `file_name`, `_document`, or `is_document_page`, and a file at an
// arbitrary path reports on the binary. This is the inverse of the failure mode a broken-shut gate
// produces: the rule is over-broad rather than inert, and any file importing something named `Head`
// and rendering it twice reports with a message about a file the author may not have.
//
// It is reproduced rather than corrected, and the reason is that correcting it is not a narrowing we
// can defend as fidelity: a `pages/_document` test would silence inputs the gate currently reports,
// which is a difference the differential harness would read as ours being wrong. The four upstream
// spellings of that path test disagree with each other anyway. Recorded here rather than fixed so
// the next reader finds the decision rather than re-deriving it.
