	Description: "This is a raw <img> element. Use `<Image />` from `next/image` instead, which " +
		"serves a correctly sized image, defers what is offscreen, and reserves the space before " +
		"the bytes arrive. A raw <img> does none of that, so it costs a slower Largest " +
		"Contentful Paint and more bandwidth without failing anything at build time.",
}

// NoImgElement flags a raw <img> element outside a <picture>.
//
//	valid:   <Image src={picture} alt="" />
//	valid:   an <img> inside <picture>
//	invalid: <img src="/test.png" alt="" />
//
// Ported from `@next/next/no-img-element`, read against oxc's `no_img_element.rs`.
//
// # The <picture> exemption, and why the ancestor hop is measured rather than copied
//
// Upstream exempts an <img> whose enclosing element is a <picture>, because art direction through
// <source> siblings is the one case the framework's own component cannot express. That much is
// Vercel's judgment and is preserved.
//
// How the ancestor is reached is not portable. oxc reaches it with `ancestor_kinds(node).nth(1)`,
// a fixed two-hop walk that is correct in its tree and wrong in ours. Measured on our AST:
//
//	<picture><img /></picture>       img.Parent is the JsxElement wrapping the img itself,
//	                                 and its Parent is the <picture> JsxElement
//	<picture><img></img></picture>   the opening element sits one level deeper again
//
// A self-closing <img> and a paired <img></img> therefore reach <picture> at different fixed
// depths, so any hard-coded hop count is right for one form and wrong for the other. The rule walks
// to the nearest enclosing JSX element instead and asks what it is, which is what the fixed hop was
// approximating in a tree where the two forms happen to agree.

	// and passes every one of its own tests. That is not hypothetical: the first rule in this
	// package shipped that way and was inert.
