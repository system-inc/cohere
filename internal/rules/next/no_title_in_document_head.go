	Description: "A <title> here is emitted once for every page in the application, because the " +
		"`Head` from `next/document` renders the shared document shell rather than a page. A page " +
		"that then sets its own title competes with this one and which wins depends on order. Set " +
		"the title per page, with `Head` from `next/head`.",
}

// NoTitleInDocumentHead flags a <title> written directly inside a component imported from
// `next/document`.
//
//	valid:   import Head from 'next/head';     <Head><title>x</title></Head>
//	valid:   import { Head } from 'next/document';  <Head></Head>
//	invalid: import { Head } from 'next/document';  <Head><title>x</title></Head>
//
// Ported from oxc's `no_title_in_document_head.rs`, read against `@next/next`'s own rule. There is
// no option surface: oxc's struct is a unit and eslint declares `schema: []`.
//
// # The import is the gate, and there is deliberately no path gate
//
// Five rules in this package ask whether the file is a document or an application-directory file
// before they run. This one does not, and the absence is upstream's and is correct. The rule cannot
// be reached until a file has imported from `next/document`, which is a far tighter gate than any
// filename test: a `<Head>` from `@react-email/components` or a local component of that name can
// never satisfy it. Adding `nextjs.IsDocumentFile` here would look like a tidy-up and would silently
// delete the rule's main true positive, since `next/document`'s `Head` used *outside* a document
// file is exactly the mistake being caught, and both upstreams catch it there.
//
// # Only the FIRST named specifier of a declaration is watched, and that is a defect reproduced
//
// oxc reaches for the import's specifiers with `find_map`, which stops at the first one matching the
// named arm, and then watches only that binding. Every later named specifier in the same declaration
// is invisible. Measured against the release binary:
//
//	import { Head, Html } from 'next/document';  <Head><title>x</title></Head>   reports
//	import { Html, Head } from 'next/document';  <Head><title>x</title></Head>   silent
//	import { Html, Head } from 'next/document';  <Html><title>x</title></Html>   reports
//	import { A, Head, C } from 'next/document';  <Head><title>x</title></Head>   silent
//
// So the real violation goes unreported whenever `Head` is not written first, which is the ordering
// `next/document` users actually write, since `Html` conventionally comes first. Upstream's own
// second passing fixture is `import Document, { Html, Head }` with an empty `<Head>`, and it is
// clean for two reasons at once rather than the one it looks like: the `Head` is empty AND the
// watched binding is `Html`. That fixture cannot see this defect and neither can the other two.
//
// It is reproduced rather than corrected because the harness compares against oxc, and a port that
// helpfully watched every named specifier would report on inputs oxc is silent on. The intuitive
// reading is that the rule watches whichever specifier is named `Head`; it does not check the
// imported name at all, so `import { Html }` arms it and `<Html><title/></Html>` reports. Both
// halves are pinned by fixtures so neither is quietly corrected back.
//
// A separate import declaration gets its own first specifier, so two declarations watch two
// bindings.
//
// # References resolve through the checker rather than by name
//
// oxc walks `symbol_references` off the specifier's symbol, which is shadow-aware for free. Matching
// the local binding's text instead would be right in every fixture upstream ships and wrong on a
// local declaration of the same name inside a function. The checker answers this directly: asking
// `GetSymbolAtLocation` on the tag identifier and comparing the resolved declaration against the
// specifier node by identity reproduces upstream exactly, including the aliased form, and a shadowed
// `Head` resolves to its own variable declaration rather than to the import. Measured on all three
// shapes before the rule was written.
