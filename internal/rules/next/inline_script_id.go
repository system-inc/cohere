// Ported from oxc's `inline_script_id.rs`, whose corpus is eight pass cases and four fail cases
// carrying four diagnostics, one per input. The corpus is strong on spreads and silent on every
// negative form of the import gate, so most of what follows was measured against the release oxlint
// binary rather than read off a fixture. Each probe states its verdict.
//
// # The import gate is a real resolution here, and this rule is the opposite of its sibling
//
// oxc anchors on the `ImportDefaultSpecifier` of `next/script` and walks
// `ctx.semantic().symbol_references(...)`, so the elements it inspects are the ones whose tag
// actually binds to that import. That makes `imports.LocalNameOfDefaultImport` the faithful helper
// rather than a convenient one, and the distinction matters because the neighbouring
// `no-before-interactive-script-outside-document` reaches the opposite conclusion in this same
// package: its upstream `find_map`s the module record and binds a named or namespace import too, so
// that rule declines the helper and matches text. Two rules over the same module, two different
// gates, written by different hands upstream. Probed here rather than assumed:
//
//	function Script(){}; <Script>{`x()`}</Script>              silent   a local component never binds
//	import S from 'next/script'; <S>{`x()`}</S>                REPORTS  the alias is what resolves
//	import { X } from 'next/script'; <X>...</X>                silent   a named import does not bind
//	import * as Script from 'next/script'; <Script>...         silent   a namespace import does not
//	import Script, { X } from 'next/script'; <Script>...       REPORTS  the default half still binds
//	import Script from 'other/script'; <Script>...             silent   compared exactly
//	<Script.Inner>{`x()`}</Script.Inner>                       silent   a member tag is not the binding
//
// `imports.LocalNameOfDefaultImport`'s doc comment invites a port to resolve the import instead of
// string matching, calling upstream's string match a defect. On this rule the invitation happens to
// describe upstream, so it is taken; on the sibling it is declined. The helper's guidance is
// therefore not a general rule in either direction, and which way it falls has to be measured per
// rule against the reference implementation.
//
// Resolution is approximated by name rather than by symbol, because we have no reference walk. The
// two answers separate only when a `next/script` default binding is shadowed by an inner
// declaration of the same name, which no corpus case and no probe here exercises. That gap is
// stated rather than papered over: a shadowed `Script` would report here and be silent upstream.
//
// A second `next/script` import in one file is handled the way oxc handles it, which is that both
// bindings arm the rule. Probed: with `import Script` and `import Other` both from `next/script`,
// two inline elements report twice. The eslint original keeps a single module-scoped `let` and so
// tracks only the last import, which is a real disagreement between the two upstreams, and oxc is
// the port target.
//
// # What counts as inline, measured rather than reasoned
//
// Either children or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` arms the report, independently, and an `id` from any
// source disarms it. `src` does not exempt anything, which is worth pinning because the rule's
// documentation talks about external scripts and the only passing external fixture also happens to
// have no children:
//
//	<Script src="https://e.com">{`x()`}</Script>               REPORTS  src exempts nothing
//	<Script></Script>                                          silent   zero children is not inline
//	<Script>\n  </Script>                                      REPORTS  whitespace is a child
//
// The whitespace case is upstream's `!children.is_empty()` reading a JsxText node that holds only a
// newline and spaces, and our parser produces that node too, so the verdicts agree. It is pinned
// below because nothing in the corpus covers it and because `ast.IsWhitespaceOnlyJsxText` exists on
// the shelf and would be the obvious thing to reach for: it would silence this input and diverge.
//
// # Spreads are read, which is the part of this rule a reader will not expect
//
// A spread is a real `KindJsxSpreadAttribute` node rather than an absence, and unlike most rules in
// this package this one looks inside it. An object literal contributes its keys to the same name
// set the written attributes go into, so a spread can supply the `id` that disarms the rule.
// Anything else is opaque, and an opaque spread abandons the element entirely rather than merely
// being skipped: upstream spells that as a labelled `continue 'references_loop`, eslint as an early
// return citing vercel/next.js#34030 with the comment that non-checkable spreads are simply
// ignored. The difference is observable and is the corpus's one untested half:
//
//	<Script {...{ id: "a" }}>{`x()`}</Script>                  silent   the spread supplies id
//	<Script {...({ id: "a" })}>{`x()`}</Script>                silent   without_parentheses is real
//	<Script {...{ id }}>{`x()`}</Script>                       silent   shorthand is a static key
//	<Script {...{ "id": "a" }}>{`x()`}</Script>                REPORTS  a string key is not one
//	<Script {...{ ["id"]: "a" }}>{`x()`}</Script>              REPORTS  nor is a computed key
//	<Script {...{ ...o }}>{`x()`}</Script>                     REPORTS  a nested spread contributes nothing
//	<Script {...opaque}>{`x()`}</Script>                       silent   the whole element is abandoned
//	<Script {...opaque} dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{}} />        silent   abandoned before dSIH is read
//
// Upstream matches `PropertyKey::StaticIdentifier` only, which is why the string and computed keys
// report even though a reader would call them the same property. `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName`
// resolves all four shapes and is deliberately not used here for that reason: it would silence the
// last three and read as a correctness improvement while being a divergence.
//
// A namespaced attribute name (`x:id`) reports, matching `JSXAttributeName::Identifier`, and
// `jsx.AttributeName` already declines that shape.
//
// The finding points at the tag name, taken from the snapshot, whose caret spans the six characters
// of `Script` and the eight of `MyScript` rather than the whole element. The eslint original reports
// the whole JsxElement, and that is a disagreement in which oxc is the port target.
//
// No fix. Upstream ships none, and the repair is a name only the author can choose.
