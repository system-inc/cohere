// absoluteDestination matches a destination that leaves the application.
//
// A scheme (`https:`, `mailto:`, `tel:`) or a protocol-relative prefix (`//host`) is treated as
// leaving; everything else is internal and reports. Copied from the original's `ABSOLUTE_URL_RE`
// including the case-insensitive flag and including the detail that a scheme must begin with a
// letter, so `1abc:/x` is relative rather than absolute.

// locationRootPrefixes is the set of receivers the original accepts in front of `.location`.
//
// Four names, and the two easy ones to lose are `document` and `self`: the nearest analogue in this
// tree carries only `window` and `globalThis`, so a port that reuses that map drops half the set
// with nothing to notice. `top` and `parent` are real browser globals and are deliberately absent,
// because the original does not carry them either.

//	invalid: window.location.href = '/search?term=' + encodeURIComponent(term)
//
// Ported from `@next/next/no-location-assign-relative-destination`. There is no oxc implementation
// of this rule, so the original JavaScript is the entire specification and there is no imported
// corpus behind the fixtures; every case in the test file was established by running the original
// through ESLint's Linter API rather than by predicting its answer from the source.
//
// # What the original decides, and what it does not
//
// Two forms and only two. `location.assign(...)` as a call, and `location.href` as an assignment
// target. `location.replace(...)` is the same hazard and the original does not handle it, so
// neither does this; that gap is reproduced rather than closed, because closing it would report on
// code the framework's own rule accepts. Reading `location.href` is likewise untouched, since the
// original matches it only on the left of an assignment.
//
// The assignment operator is never read. `location.href += '/x'` reports exactly as `=` does, and so
// do `-=`, `||=` and `??=`. That looks like an oversight and it is preserved: measured against the
// original, all four report.
//
// # Resolving the destination
//
// The original asks `getStringIfConstant` first, which is a full static evaluator: it folds
// arithmetic, resolves constants through scope, and evaluates a whitelist of pure builtins, so
// `[”, 'x'].join('/')` and `String(1)` are both in its reach. That surface is deliberately not
// reproduced. What is reproduced is the shape that decides real code: a literal, the text before a
// template's first interpolation, the left side of a `+`, and an identifier resolved to its
// nearest binding.
//
// The consequence of declining the evaluator is a narrower rule rather than a wrong one, and it is
// narrow in one measurable direction. Measured against the original: `location.assign('htt' +
// 'ps://x')` is silent there because the evaluator folds the whole concatenation into an absolute
// url before the left-recursion is ever reached, while this rule sees only the relative left side
// and reports. Two constant strings concatenated into a scheme is not a shape that appears in real
// navigation code, and the alternative is carrying an evaluator to make one contrived input agree.
// Stated here rather than left for a reader to discover.
//
// A template opening with an interpolation has an empty first span, and the empty string is
// relative, so “ location.href = `${base}/path` “ reports whatever `base` actually holds. That is
// an upstream false-positive class and it is reproduced on purpose. Do not narrow it without
// changing the original first.
//
// # Deciding the receiver is the global
//
// The original looks the name up in the global scope's binding set and declines if anything
// declared it. Reproduced here as a walk outward from the use looking for a value binding of the
// name, which answers the same question on a file that does not type-check. The two differ on one
// measured shape: a block-scoped shadow that has already closed. Upstream reads the global scope
// rather than the lexical chain, so `{ const location = {}; } location.assign('/x')` reports there,
// and the walk below agrees because the closed block is not an enclosing scope of the use.
