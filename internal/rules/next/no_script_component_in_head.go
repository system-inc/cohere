// NoScriptComponentInHead flags a <Script> written as a direct child of next/head's <Head>.

//	valid:   import Head from 'next/head'; <Head><div><Script /></div></Head>

//
// Ported from `@next/next/no-script-component-in-head`, read against oxc's
// `no_script_component_in_head.rs` and measured on the release binary, because the corpus is one
// pass case and one fail case and answers almost none of the questions the rule actually decides.
//
// # The two halves are asymmetric, and that asymmetry is the rule
//
// The `<Head>` side is resolved. oxc enters on the import declaration, finds `next/head`'s default
// specifier, and walks that symbol's references, so an aliased `import H from 'next/head'` reports
// and a `Head` shadowed by a local binding does not.
//
// The `<Script>` side is a bare string comparison on the child's tag text. `next/script` is never
// resolved, and oxc's own source shows this is not an oversight the way the eslint original's is:
// the eslint plugin carries a dead `if (node.source.value !== 'next/script') return` inside a
// visitor that does nothing afterwards. Both land in the same place.
//
// **The consequences run in both directions and both were measured rather than reasoned about.** A
// locally defined component named `Script` inside a real `next/head` `<Head>` reports, and
// `import S from 'next/script'` used as `<S>` inside `<Head>` is silent. Those look like defects and
// reproducing them is the port. `imports.LocalNameOfDefaultImport` sits one line away and its own
// doc comment invites resolving the script side, calling upstream's string match a defect that a
// port using the helper would improve on. Taking that invitation would flip both verdicts above and
// no imported fixture could see it, because the corpus writes `Script` as the local name of a real
// `next/script` import, where resolving and not resolving agree. The fixtures below pin both
// directions so the improvement cannot be made by accident.
//
// # Why the checker rather than a name
//
// Matching the tag text against the import's local name passes every case upstream ships and every
// obvious one a porter would invent. It fails on shadowing, which is silent upstream and which
// nothing in the corpus writes: `const Head = ...` inside the function shadows the import, and the
// element is then not the framework's head at all. The checker answers which declaration a tag
// binds to, so the rule anchors on the import clause the listener already saw and compares node
// identity, the technique `no_class_assign.go` established.
//
// An import binding's symbol declares at the `ImportClause`, not at the identifier, which is why the
// anchor is the default binding's parent rather than the binding itself. Measured with a probe; the
// identifier compares equal to nothing.
//
// # Depth, kinds, and count
//
// Only direct children, one level. `<Head><div><Script /></div></Head>` is silent upstream and is
// pinned silent here, so a later deep walk is a test failure rather than a quiet widening.
//
// Both element kinds are scanned as children. oxc sees one `JSXElement` node whose opening element
// may be self closing; our parser splits that into `KindJsxElement` and `KindJsxSelfClosingElement`,
// and the self closing form is the one real code writes. A port reading only `KindJsxElement`
// children passes both upstream fixtures and misses `<Script src="..." />` entirely.
//
// One finding per matching child rather than one per `<Head>`, and the finding points at the `<Head>`
// opening element's name node rather than at the `<Script>` that caused it. Both taken from the
// snapshot, whose caret sits under `Head` for four columns.
//
// No fix. The repair moves an element out of a subtree and has to choose where it lands, which
// changes what the page does.
