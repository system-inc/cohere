	Description: "This loads Google Analytics through a plain <script> tag, which the framework " +
		"cannot schedule: it has no loading strategy, so it competes with hydration for the main " +
		"thread, and nothing deduplicates it across client navigations. Use the `Script` component " +
		"from `next/script`, which picks a strategy and injects the tag once.",
}

// NextScriptForGa flags a plain <script> that loads Google Analytics.
//
//	valid:   import Script from 'next/script'; <Script src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=X" />
//	valid:   <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{}} />
//	invalid: <script src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js" />
//	invalid: <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: `...www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js...`}} />
//
// Ported from oxc's `next_script_for_ga.rs`, whose corpus is four pass cases and five fail cases
// carrying five diagnostics, one per input.
//
// # The rule is narrower than its name, and the corpus is what says so
//
// The name reads as "Google Analytics written inline", and a port built on that reading reports
// roughly twice what upstream does. What the rule actually matches is **two short substring lists,
// and they are not the same list**:
//
//	src            www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js   www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js
//	inline __html  www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js   www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js
//
// `gtag/js` is src-only and `gtm.js` is inline-only, which is not a symmetry a reader would invent.
// Measured against the release binary: `<script src=".../gtm.js?id=X" />` is silent and
// `{__html: ` + "`" + `...gtag/js...` + "`" + `}` is silent, each on the arm the other list would have caught.
//
// The consequence is visible inside the corpus rather than only at the edges. Two of the five fail
// inputs contain a **second** <script> that does not report, and one of those is an inline gtag
// bootstrap, exactly the code the rule's documentation shows as the thing to avoid. It is silent
// because a gtag snippet names neither inline substring. Both fixtures assert one finding, not two,
// and a port reading "inline Google Analytics" as the subject fails on the count.
//
// Neither list is a host or a prefix. The match is a plain case-sensitive `contains` over the whole
// value, so `http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js` reports (scheme is never examined) and
// `WWW.GOOGLE-ANALYTICS.COM/ANALYTICS.JS` is silent (the value is compared case-sensitively even
// though the attribute name is not). Both measured.
//
// # Case sensitivity runs opposite ways on the name and the value
//
// Upstream reaches both attributes through `has_jsx_prop_ignore_case`, so the attribute **names**
// are matched with `eq_ignore_ascii_case`, and it spells the second one lowercase as
// `"dangerouslysetinnerhtml"`, which only finds anything because of that leniency. Measured:
// `<script SRC=... />` reports and `<script DANGEROUSLYSETINNERHTML=... />` reports.
//
// The **tag** name is not lenient. Upstream compares it to the literal `"script"`, so `<SCRIPT
// src=".../analytics.js" />` is silent, measured. That asymmetry is the reason this rule uses
// `jsx.MatchIgnoringCase` where its `no-sync-scripts` and `no-unwanted-polyfillio` siblings use
// `jsx.MatchExactly`. The shelf's own comment says the matcher is a per-rule decision rather than a
// per-family one, and this rule is on the other side of that line from every script rule beside it.
//
// A namespaced attribute (`x:src`) is silent upstream, which `jsx.AttributeName` already declines.
//
// # The two branches, and the one that returns
//
// The `src` branch reports and **returns**, so an element whose src matches never also reports for
// its inline content. Measured: a script carrying both a matching src and a matching `__html`
// reports once. Every other exit from the src branch falls through, so a non-matching src, an
// expression-valued src, an empty src and a spread all still reach the inline test. All four
// measured.
//
// # The inline branch reproduces three upstream narrownesses that read as defects
//
// Each of these would look like a correctness improvement to repair, and each would be a divergence.
//
// **Only a template literal counts.** `{__html: "www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"}` written
// with a plain string literal is silent, measured. Upstream destructures
// `Expression::TemplateLiteral` and returns otherwise, so a string, a call, and an identifier all
// decline. The corpus' fifth fail case is exactly this: its inline value is
// `this.createGoogleAnalyticsMarkup()`, and the finding it carries belongs to the *other* script on
// the line below.
//
// **Only `quasis[0]` is searched.** A URL sitting after an interpolation is invisible. Measured:
// “ `head${x}www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js` “ is **silent** while
// “ `www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js${x}tail` “ reports. This is upstream indexing the first
// chunk rather than joining them, and it is reproduced.
//
// **The raw text is searched, not the cooked value.** Measured:
// “ `www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js` “ is silent upstream, because `.raw` still holds
// the six characters of the escape. Our `Node.Text()` cooks that to a period and would report, so
// the raw bytes are recovered by slicing the source with the node's own range. There is no
// `RawText` accessor on the shim, and the one in typescript-go panics on a
// `NoSubstitutionTemplateLiteral`, so the slice is the available route rather than a preference.
//
// **Only a plain identifier key named `__html` counts**, and the **first** one wins. Measured:
// `{"__html": ...}`, `{["__html"]: ...}` and a bare `{...spread}` are all silent, and a duplicated
// `__html` takes the first value and stops rather than searching on. `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName`
// resolves the string and computed forms and is deliberately not used here for that reason, which
// is the same call the neighbouring `inline-script-id` makes about the same shelf function.
//
// **Parentheses are not skipped.** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={(({__html: ...}))}` is silent upstream,
// measured, because this rule destructures `JSXExpression::ObjectExpression` directly with no
// `without_parentheses()` call. The neighbouring `inline-script-id` **does** call it and this one
// does not, so the two rules disagree about parentheses over the same attribute shape. Adding a
// `ast.SkipParentheses` here would read as tidying and would change a verdict.
//
// The finding points at the tag name, six characters of `script`, taken from the snapshot's caret.
// No fix: the repair is an import plus a component plus a strategy choice, which upstream does not
// attempt either.
