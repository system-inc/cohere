	Description: "This is a raw <head> element. Use the `Head` component from `next/head`, which " +
		"merges what every page contributes and deduplicates it, so two components asking for a " +
		"title do not both emit one. A hand-written <head> is emitted as-is and silently competes " +
		"with whatever the framework already put there.",
}

// NoHeadElement flags a raw <head> element outside the app directory.
//
//	valid:   <Head><title>x</title></Head>
//	valid:   a <head> in a file under an app directory
//	invalid: <head><title>x</title></head>
//
// Ported from `@next/next/no-head-element`, read against oxc's `no_head_element.rs`.
//
// # The app-directory exemption, and why it is a substring test
//
// The App Router owns the document shell itself, so a `<head>` written there is the framework's own
// metadata handling rather than a page competing with it. Upstream skips the whole file in that
// case, through what oxc spells `is_in_app_dir`, which is a plain substring test for `app/` on the
// path.
//
// That is looser than it looks and it is preserved rather than tightened. A path segment test would
// be the obvious improvement, but it would change which files the rule runs on, and upstream's
// answer is the one the rule's behaviour is defined by. Measured on this repository, the two agree:
// every `.tsx` path containing `app/` contains it as a real directory segment, so the loose test
// costs nothing here and being faithful costs nothing either.
//
// The exemption is checked once per file rather than per node, because it is a property of the file.
