// Ported from `@next/next/no-unwanted-polyfillio`, read against oxc's `no_unwanted_polyfillio.rs`.
//
// # Two rules under one name, and only the second matches the name
//
// The first arm is a pure blocklist on the URL prefix, for the 2024 compromise, and it never looks
// at the feature list at all. It reports on the domain alone and returns, so
// `https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=Promise` says "security risk" and never says
// "Promise is already shipped" even though it would have qualified. Two of upstream's four failing
// cases exercise only this arm, so a port that folded the arms into one code path and lost the
// distinct message would still pass half the corpus.
//
// The second arm is the duplicate check, and it runs only on the three domains that replaced
// polyfill.io after the compromise.
//
// # What the corpus does not pin, measured on the release binary instead
//
// Upstream tests each gate broken open and none broken shut, so several of the decisions below have
// no fixture upstream and were established by running oxlint rather than by reading. Each was run
// with `no-sync-scripts` alongside as a control, because a config missing its `plugins` key makes
// every rule silent and a silent probe reads exactly like a decline.
//
// Feature matching is exact, case-sensitive equality on a whole comma-separated token:
// `features=promise` is silent. An unknown feature sitting beside a known one still reports, and the
// message names only the known one. `Array.prototype.@@iterator` carries a literal double at sign.
//
// Only %2C is decoded, uppercase only, and by a plain string replacement rather than a percent
// decode. `features=Promise%2cSet` is silent upstream because neither token survives as a whole
// name. That is a defect a port using Go's `url.QueryUnescape` would silently repair, which would be
// a divergence rather than an improvement, so the replacement is reproduced exactly.
//
// The prefixes are matched with the scheme attached, so `http://polyfill.io/v3/`, a
// protocol-relative `//cdn.polyfill.io/v2/`, and a path-only URL are all silent.
//
// # Resolving the tag name, and the shelf helper that would have got it wrong
//
// A lowercase `script` matches directly. Any other tag matches only if the file imports
// `next/script` and binds it to that name. oxc reads its module record's import entries and takes
// the local name of the first entry for that module, whatever kind of binding it is, so a default
// import, a named `import {Script}`, and a namespace `import * as S` all qualify. All three were
// confirmed reporting on the release binary, and `<Script />` with no such import was confirmed
// silent.
//
// `imports.LocalNameOfDefaultImport` is the obvious shelf reach here and it is the wrong one. Its
// doc comment invites a port to resolve the import properly and calls upstream's looser reading a
// defect, which is sound advice for the sibling rule it was written for and a behaviour change
// here: it answers only for a default binding, so the named and namespace forms above would go
// silent against a measured upstream that reports on both. `imports.BindingsOf` is used instead,
// which returns all three shapes, and the first-entry rule is reproduced by preferring the default
// binding and falling back in source order.
