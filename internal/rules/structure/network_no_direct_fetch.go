	Description: "This calls `fetch` directly. Every network request goes through NetworkService " +
		"instead, which is where retries, timeouts, error shaping, authentication headers and " +
		"cache invalidation live. A direct call gets none of them and fails differently from every " +
		"other request in the application, which is the kind of inconsistency that only shows up " +
		"under a flaky connection. NetworkService.ts itself is exempt, since it is the one place " +
		"the raw primitive is allowed.",
}

// NetworkNoDirectFetch flags a direct call to fetch.
//
//	valid:   networkService.request(url)
//	valid:   fetch(url)                     (inside NetworkService.ts only)
//	invalid: fetch(url)
//	invalid: window.fetch(url)
//	invalid: globalThis.fetch(url)
//
// Three spellings reach the same primitive, enumerated before the listener rather than after: the
// bare call, and the two global objects it hangs off. A rule catching only the bare form would be
// trivially worked around by writing `window.fetch`, which is not a workaround anyone would think of
// deliberately but is exactly what a copied snippet contains.
//
// The exemption is by path rather than by an inline comment, because the file that implements the
// wrapper is a fixed and knowable place rather than a judgment call, and a rule that forbids the
// thing it asks people to use is a rule people learn to disable.
//
// No fix. Replacing a fetch with a NetworkService call means choosing a method, a response shape,
// and an error path, which is the work the rule is asking for rather than something to generate.
