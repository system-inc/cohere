// TestConsistencyOrganizeImportsClassification is the differential against the TypeScript rule.
//
// Each row is one import statement and the group the LIVE original put it in, harvested by running
// that rule's own fixer through ESLint's Linter API and reading back the header it emitted. No row
// here was reasoned about: the table is a recording, and it is the only thing standing between this
// port and a classifier that agrees with its own author.
//
// The verdict is read the same way round, by asking this rule whether a file holding that one import
// under that one header is organized. A header naming the right group is silent and any other header
// reports, so a disagreement about classification surfaces as a finding rather than as silence.
