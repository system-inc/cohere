// Every rule in this package is run over shapes where a node it reaches for is legitimately absent.
//
// This exists because react-component-no-display-name shipped a crash that review did not catch and
// only a fixture did. `ast.SkipParentheses` dereferences its argument, so a nil check placed after
// the call rather than before it panics, and the shapes that produce a nil are ordinary: a
// `declare const` with no initializer, a `let` with no initializer, a call with no arguments, an
// object shorthand property with no explicit value.
//
// A crash is worse than a wrong finding. A wrong finding is visible and arguable; a panic takes
// down the walk for the whole file, so every other rule's verdict on that file is lost too, and on
// a large tree the file that crashed is one line in a log nobody reads.
//
// Kept as a standing guard rather than deleted after the fix, because the pattern recurs: nearly
// every rule in this family reaches for an initializer, an argument, or a type annotation that does
// not have to exist. Add new rules to the list.
//
// # What a pass here does and does not mean
//
// The shape list below is the measurement, and it is short: a handful of shapes one person thought
// of in a few minutes. A green run means every listed rule survived those shapes. It is not a claim
// that the package cannot panic, and the difference matters because the two look identical from
// here.
//
// This guard has found exactly one crash, the one it was built from. Reading "found nothing since"
// as coverage is the same error as reading a clean probe as safety: a probe that does not reach a
// line proves nothing about the line, only about the inputs. So when a new rule reaches for
// something optional in a shape not listed here, the fix is to add the shape, not to trust the
// green.
