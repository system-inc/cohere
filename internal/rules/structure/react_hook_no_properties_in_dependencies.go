		"whenever the parent re-renders, because a parent building its props inline hands down a " +
		"new object every time even when nothing in it changed. Every field the component does not " +
		"read is now a trigger. Pull out what the hook actually depends on first, as " +
		"`const propertiesOnRefresh = properties.onRefresh;`, and depend on those instead.",

// hooksWithDependencies are the React hooks that take a dependency array.

// useImperativeHandle is the one whose array is not the second argument, and that difference is

// ReactHookNoPropertiesInDependencies flags a whole `properties` object in a hook dependency array.
//
//	valid:   React.useEffect(() => { run(properties.id); }, [propertiesId])
//	valid:   React.useEffect(() => { run(properties.id); }, [properties.id])
//	invalid: React.useEffect(() => { run(properties.id); }, [properties])
//
// Ported from `structure/react-hook-no-properties-in-dependencies`.
//
// # Only `React.useEffect`, never a bare `useEffect`
//
// The original matches its callee through `isReactMethodCall`, which requires the callee to be a
// member expression whose object is the identifier `React`. A bare `useEffect(...)` imported
// directly is a plain identifier callee and never matches, so it is invisible to the rule.
//
// That is a real narrowing rather than an oversight to correct, and it costs nothing here: measured
// on the tree, 435 `React.<hook>` call sites and 0 bare ones, because this codebase imports React as
// a namespace. Widening it would report call sites the gate does not, which is the failure mode this
// port is judged against.
//
// # The dependency array is the third argument for one hook
//
// `useImperativeHandle(ref, factory, dependencies)` puts its array third; every other hook here puts
// it second. Reading the second argument for all five would check a factory function for
// `useImperativeHandle` and find nothing, so the rule would be quietly dead on that hook alone.
//
// # Where the report lands
//
// On the offending element inside the array rather than on the call, matching the original. An array
// listing `properties` twice reports twice, which is what the original does, and anchoring on the
// call would collapse them into one finding at a line the author has to search.

// `IsLikelyComponentName` tests the first character for a capital and `IsHookName` tests for a
// leading `use` followed by a capital, so the two are mutually exclusive: `useThing` starts with a
// lowercase `u` and is rejected before the exclusion is consulted. Confirmed by evaluating both
// predicates over the real names rather than by reading them, and the original has the same
// structure with `/^[A-Z]/` and `/^use[A-Z]/`.
//
// So no fixture can kill a mutant that deletes the exclusion, and mutation testing reported it as a
// survivor. It stays because it is what the original says, and because the pair only stays disjoint
// while both predicates keep their current definitions: widening either one silently makes this
// clause load-bearing at a line the change does not touch. Recorded here rather than left looking
// like an untested guard.
//
// Every enclosing function is tested rather than only the nearest, matching the original's loop. The
// nearest is usually the anonymous callback passed to the hook itself, which has no name at all, so
// stopping there would silence the rule everywhere.
