// React detection: does this function hold JSX or call a hook?
//
// The answer decides whether a PascalCase function is a component, and every rule about components
// rests on it. It is also where the tailwind port went wrong: JSX element names are plain
// identifiers in typescript-go's AST, and reading them as bindings produced 3,081 spurious findings
// (commit 02c720b). The lesson generalizes past that rule. An exemption the original gets free from
// its AST has to be written down explicitly in ours, because the two ASTs disagree about what a JSX
// name even is.

// jsxWalkDepthLimit bounds the search, matching the original's limit of 20.
//
// The bound is behavior rather than a safety valve, which is why it is reproduced rather than
// dropped. A deeply nested component whose JSX sits past the limit reads as "not a component" to the
// gate verify replaces, and a Go walk with no limit would find it and report a finding the gate
// does not. Parity is the acceptance criterion, so the limit ports with the rule.

// HasJsxOrReactHookCalls reports whether a subtree holds JSX or calls a React hook.
//
// The original walks a fixed list of eleven property names rather than every child, and reproducing
// that bound matters: an exhaustive walk finds JSX in places the original never descends into, and
// every such find is a finding the gate does not have.
//
// Naming the node kinds that carry those properties was the wrong way to reproduce it, and measuring
// is what caught it. The list looked complete and missed if, switch, for and try, because those
// carry their branches on exactly the properties the original does walk: an IfStatement's consequent
// and alternate, a loop's and a try's body. One component out of 128 was lost to that gap, and it
// was the one whose JSX all sat inside if statements.
//
// So this excludes rather than enumerates. Everything is walked except the few places the original's
// property list genuinely cannot reach, which is the same set stated as a boundary instead of as an
// inventory, and it fails toward the original rather than away from it.

// This is a different question from HasJsxOrReactHookCalls and the two are not interchangeable,

// live tree. That one asks "does this subtree contain JSX anywhere", walking a bounded property
// list. This one is the original's `isLikelyReactComponent`, and it asks two much narrower things:
//
//	the first parameter is named `properties` or `props`, or
//	a top-level return in the body returns JSX, or a ternary with a JSX branch
//
// The parameter-name arm is the load-bearing half and it is checked first, before any JSX is looked
// for. A component whose JSX is unreachable to a bounded walk is still a component under this test
// as long as it takes `properties`, which is exactly the case that caught this: a switch-dispatch
// component returns JSX only from switch arms, and the property walk cannot reach a switch arm.
//
// The consequence differs by which question a rule is asking. A rule asking "is this a component,
// flag it" loses a finding when detection misses, which is a quiet parity gap. A rule asking "does
// this file export a component by name" gains a false finding, because the component it failed to
// see was the exported one. Only the second polarity turns a detection miss into a report.
