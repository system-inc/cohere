		"its properties instead. A hook's returned object is the thing callers pass around and " +
		"log, and destructuring inside the hook breaks the chain between a value and where it came " +
		"from: a reader seeing a bare name has to find which of several calls produced it.",

// ReactHookNoDestructuring flags object destructuring inside a custom hook's body.
//
//	valid:   function useThing() { const result = useQuery(); return result.data; }
//	invalid: function useThing() { const { data } = useQuery(); return data; }
//
// Only object destructuring, matching the original. Array destructuring is exempt and that is the
// convention rather than an oversight: `const [value, setValue] = React.useState()` has no property
// names to preserve, so there is nothing for the rule to protect.
//
// The enclosing-hook test walks every enclosing function rather than only the nearest, so a
// destructure inside a callback inside a hook still counts. That is the original's behavior and it
// is what makes the rule hold: a hook's callbacks are part of the hook.
//
// The original gates on `isReactFile || isTypeScriptFile`, which together mean any .ts or .tsx file
// and so exclude nothing this linter would ever see. Reproduced as no gate at all rather than as
// two flags whose disjunction is always true, since a guard that cannot fail reads as a guard that
// might.

				// inside a hook and the original does not report it either: its check is on a
				// VariableDeclarator's `init`, which ESTree leaves null in a for-of head.
				//
				// Reproduced rather than improved on. Reporting it would be defensible and would
