	// is the framework's contract rather than an authoring choice, so a rule about how many

	// Every rule routing network access through NetworkService has to exempt NetworkService itself,
	// or the rule forbids the thing it is asking people to use.
	IsNetworkServiceFile bool

	// IsLinkComponentFile marks the Link component's own implementation, which is the one place an
	// <a> element is allowed. Same shape as IsNetworkServiceFile: a rule saying "use Link instead"
	// has to exempt the file where Link is built, or it forbids the thing it recommends.

	// IsLocalStorageServiceFile marks the storage service and its internal utilities, the one place
	// allowed to reach raw localStorage. Same shape as the two above, and it covers the internal

	// service live there rather than in the file that re-exports them.
