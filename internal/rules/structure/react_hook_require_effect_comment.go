		"effect is the one place in a component where the reason for the code is not visible in " +
		"the code: what a render does is on the screen, and what an effect does happens somewhere " +
		"else at some other time. The comment is what lets the next reader decide whether a " +
		"dependency change is safe. Write // Effect to ... immediately above it.",
}

// effectCommentPrefix is what the first line of the comment must start with.
//
// A fixed prefix rather than "any comment", and the strictness is the point: it forces the sentence
// into the shape "Effect to <do something>", which is a claim about purpose. A free-form comment
// drifts into restating the code.

//	invalid: React.useEffect(() => { ... }, [route])
//	invalid: // sync the title
//	         React.useEffect(() => { ... }, [route])
//
// Only `React.useEffect`, matching the original. A bare `useEffect(...)` is not reported, which
// looks like a gap and is not: `react-import-no-destructuring` already forbids importing the name,
// so in this codebase the bare form cannot exist without that rule firing first. Widening this one
// would produce two findings for one mistake.
//
// The comment is looked up on the enclosing statement rather than the call. Comments attach to
// statements, so asking at the call expression finds nothing for the ordinary
// `React.useEffect(...)` written as its own statement.
