// ConsistencyOrganizeImports flags a file whose import section is not in canonical form.
//
//	valid:   // Dependencies - Frameworks
//	         import React from 'react';
//
//	         // Dependencies - Utilities
//	         import { titleCase } from '@structure/source/utilities/Strings';
//
//	invalid: import { titleCase } from '@structure/source/utilities/Strings';
//	         import React from 'react';
//
// # What canonical means, exactly
//
// Every import is classified into one of twenty-three groups (`groupOrder`). The groups are emitted
// in that fixed order, each preceded by `// Dependencies - <Group>`, with one blank line between
// consecutive groups and none before the first. An empty group emits nothing at all. Inside a
// group, imports sort by their module specifier string, byte-comparison ascending, with one
// exception: inside Frameworks, `react` sorts ahead of everything regardless of spelling, because
// it is the import every React file has and putting it first makes the block scannable.
//
// A `'use client'` or `'use server'` directive, when it is the first statement, is re-emitted with a
// fixed trailing comment and a blank line under it, above every group header.
//
// # This is a house rule, so there is no oxc corpus
//
// The authority is `libraries/structure/code-quality/lint/rules/ConsistencyOrganizeImportsRule.ts`
// in the ahra tree, and every classification and mechanic below was pinned by running that rule
// through ESLint's Linter API on constructed inputs rather than by reading it. Where this comment
// states a behavior, a probe established it.
//
// A second copy of the rule exists at `projects/www-ahra-ai/.../ConsistencyOrganizeImportsRule.ts`
// and it is behind: it has no file-description handling at all. The copy under `libraries/structure`
// is the live one and is what this ports.
//
// # Why this reports and does not repair
//
// The original ships a fixer that rewrites the whole import section, and three of its rewrites are
// wrong in ways that are invisible until they have already been applied. All three were measured on
// the real rule:
//
//	a disable comment above the first import is DELETED. `importSectionStart` is set to
//	  `firstImport.range[0]`, which is past the comment, so the preservation filter skips it as
//	  preamble while the replaced range still covers it, because an ESTree range starts at trivia.
//	  Input `// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-imports` above `import a from 'alpha'`
//	  came back as a bare space. That silently un-suppresses whatever the author was silencing.
//	a trailing comment migrates to a DIFFERENT import. `import z from 'zebra'; // note about zebra`
//	  followed by `import a from 'alpha'` came back with `// note about zebra` sitting above the
//	  alpha import, because a trailing comment reads as a leading comment of the next node.
//	a statement written between two imports is MOVED BELOW BOTH. Input
//	  `import a from 'alpha'; console.log('...'); import b from 'beta';` came back with the call
//	  after both imports, which changes evaluation order.
//
// The brief's standing rule is that a port is not obliged to carry a defect it can see, and that
// reporting without a fix is the subset that can be shown correct. A rewrite of an entire import
// block is applied unattended across three thousand files, so a wrong one is the most expensive
// shape of defect available here. The finding says the section is wrong; a human reorders it.
//
// # The finding points at the first import declaration
//
// Measured on the original: the report is anchored on `imports[0]` in every reporting case,
// including the ones where the import that is out of place is somewhere else entirely, and
// including the `'use client'` cases where the thing that is wrong is the directive's comment. The
// span is that declaration's own text.
