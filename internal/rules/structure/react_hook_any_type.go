// ReactHookAnyType flags a hook-shaped call whose result the checker cannot type.
//
//	valid:   import React from 'react'; React.useState(0)          resolves to a real tuple
//	valid:   import React from 'react'; React.useEffect(fn, [])    resolves to `void`
//	valid:   somethingElse.useCache(key)                            not a React hook shape
//	invalid: declare function useState<T>(initial: T): any; useState(0)
//	invalid: useState(0)                                            with no react types resolvable
//
// # What this checks, exactly
//
// For every call expression whose callee is either a bare identifier matching React's own hook
// pattern `/^use[A-Z0-9]/`, or a property access `React.<thatPattern>` — the two spellings a hook
// can have in this codebase — the rule asks the checker for the type of THE CALL, meaning the value
// the call produces, and reports when that type carries `TypeFlagsAny`.
//
// It checks the call's result and deliberately not the callee's type, and the difference is the
// whole rule rather than a detail. Measured on the exact input this rule was written for:
//
//	declare function useState<T>(initial: T): any;
//	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
//
//	callee type    <T>(initial: T) => any     flags = Object      NOT any
//	result type    any                        flags = Any         any
//
// A rule keyed on the callee would be silent on that file, which is the file Kirk brought. The
// callee is a perfectly well typed generic function; what is destroyed is what it hands back, and
// what it hands back is the only thing any downstream rule reads.
//
// It is not an import check, and that is a constraint rather than an omission. A text search for
// hook-using files lacking a react import returns one file on Kirk's tree and that entire file is
// commented out, so the `React.useState` it matched is inside a comment block. A checker cannot see
// a comment. More importantly the import shape is a proxy pointing the wrong way in both
// directions: `declare global`, a re-export, a monorepo path mapping and an ambient declaration all
// produce real types with no local import statement and are legitimate, while a plain missing
// import is a `tsc` error that never reaches production. The cases that DO reach production are the
// ones that satisfy `tsc` — a stale `@types` package, a path mapping that half-resolves, a shim
// somebody wrote to unblock a build — and every one of those has a resolvable-looking import.
//
// `structure/react-import-no-destructuring` is the neighbouring rule and the two do not overlap.
// That one polices HOW a name is imported, and the input above has no import statement at all for
// it to see. This one polices WHETHER the types behind the name are real. Neither substitutes.
//
// # Why only `any`, and what else was probed
//
// `any` is reported and nothing else is, established by probe rather than assumption. Every
// degraded arrangement collapses onto exactly `TypeFlagsAny` at the call result:
//
//	ambient shim returning any     result any        Any        reported
//	no declaration at all          result any        Any        reported
//	import from an unresolved      result any        Any        reported
//	  module specifier
//
// The three near neighbours are each a legitimate answer rather than an absence, and reporting them
// would fire on healthy code:
//
//	useEffect healthy              result void       Void       silent, and `void` is what a
//	                                                            correctly typed effect returns
//	declare function useX(): unknown    result unknown   Unknown  silent; `unknown` is a deliberate
//	                                                            annotation somebody wrote
//	declare function useX(): never      result never     Never    silent; `never` is deliberate too
//
// `unknown` is the one worth arguing about, and it is excluded because it is the opposite failure
// from `any`: `any` is the checker giving up, while `unknown` is an author refusing to guess and
// forcing every reader to narrow. Nothing in the tree writes a hook returning `unknown`, so
// including it would buy no findings and cost the rule its precision claim. An error type was
// probed for separately and does not arise here: a call to something the checker cannot resolve at
// all comes back as `any`, not as an error type, so the `any` test already covers it.
//
// # Why the hook shape is load-bearing rather than a filter
//
// `any` density measured across three production trees is 1.8%, 2.9% and 2.4%, so a rule reporting
// every `any`-typed call would be a tree-wide noise generator rather than a tripwire. Probed
// directly: `declare function used(x: number): any; used(1)` also produces an `any` result, and it
// is not a hook and not this rule's business. The shape test is what makes the rule mean "a React
// analysis went blind here" rather than "there is an `any` here".
//
// The pattern is React's own, `/^use[A-Z0-9]/`, and it is written here rather than taken from
// `react.IsHookName`, which rejects a digit and would go silent on `use2Things`. That shelf helper
// has thirteen callers whose semantics were settled against other authorities, so it is left alone
// and this rule carries its own predicate — the same conclusion `react/unsupported-syntax` and
// `react/void-use-memo` reached independently. Kirk's tree contains zero `use<digit>` names against
// a control of 4,055 `use<uppercase>` names, so matching React here buys nothing today and costs
// nothing, and it means a `use2Things` file cannot slip through unguarded later.
//
// # Scope: every TypeScript file, not only `.tsx`
//
// Kirk settled that `.jsx`/`.tsx` may be assumed to mean React, but restricting to those extensions
// would miss the files this rule most exists for. Measured on his tree: 74 `.ts` files call
// `React.use<Something>(` directly, and reading them shows genuine hooks — `useMessagesFeedRequest.ts`
// declares four `React.useState` setters and renders no JSX at all, because the JSX lives in the
// `.tsx` component that imports it. A custom-hook file is exactly where a setter is created and
// exactly where a type failure would be invisible. So the rule runs wherever the walk offers it a
// file and lets the hook shape do the discriminating, which is the same reason the shape test
// exists.
//
// # The message names the cost, and derives it
//
// A message reading "`useState` resolves to any" is a type-cleanliness nit and gets suppressed. The
// message here names which correctness rules are disabled by that suppression, so silencing the
// tripwire is an explicit choice rather than a tidy-up. The list is read off the live rule catalog
// at report time rather than written into a string, because a hardcoded list is wrong the week a
// new checker-based rule ships and it is confidently wrong: it keeps naming the old set while
// reading as current. See `reactHookAnyTypeBlindedRules`.

// reactHookAnyTypeBlindedRules names the rules this file's degraded types actually disable.
//
// # Why this is derived and not a string
//
// The message has to name the cost or it reads as a nit and gets suppressed. Naming the cost means
// naming rules, and a list of rule names written into a format string is wrong the week a new
// checker-based rule ships — and wrong in the worst way, because it keeps rendering a confident
// sentence about a set that has moved. That exact failure, a doc comment accurate when written and
// read as general afterwards, cost this project fourteen hours on 2026-08-23 by inoculating every
// later reader against checking. So the list is read off the live catalog at report time.
//
// # Why the predicate is `ResolvesReactValueTypes` and not `NeedsTypeChecker`
//
// This is the part that was measured rather than assumed, and the obvious answer is wrong.
//
// Forty-one registered rules declare `NeedsTypeChecker`. Only two of them go blind here. The other
// thirty-nine ask `GetSymbolAtLocation`, which resolves a BINDING, and a binding survives a
// degraded type completely. Probed on the same file, twice, on the same call:
//
//	declare function useState<T>(initial: T): any;
//	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
//
//	GetSymbolAtLocation(useState)   symbol `useState`, 1 declaration   resolves fine
//	GetTypeAtLocation(call)         `any`, TypeFlagsAny                blind
//
// So `typescript/await-thenable` and `core/no-array-constructor` are not disabled by a fake
// `useState` and naming them would be an overclaim, while `react/set-state-in-render` and
// `react/set-state-in-effect` identify a setter by reading the type's alias and lose every finding
// in the file. A message naming all forty-one would be confidently wrong in one direction and a
// hardcoded pair confidently wrong in the other. `rule.ResolvesReactValueTypes` is the declaration
// each rule makes about its own predicate, which is the only place that knowledge honestly lives.
//
// # The one honest limitation, stated because it is invisible otherwise
//
// `rule.Registered()` returns what the LINKED BINARY registered. In `cmd/cohere` every rule package
// is imported, so this sees all of them. In this package's own test binary only `structure` rules
// are linked, so it sees zero — which would make a fixture assert a sentence the real tool never
// prints. That is not a fallback to paper over; it is a real difference between two binaries, so the
