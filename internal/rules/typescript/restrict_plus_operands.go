//
// `+` is the one operator in the language that means two unrelated things, and TypeScript permits
// the mixture rather than the intent. `1 + '1'` is `'11'` and almost never what was written.
//
// # The shape of the decision
//
// One early exit and then two passes, and the order between them is what the rule IS rather than an
// implementation detail.
//
// The early exit is `leftType == rightType` on POINTER identity plus a flag test for bigint, number
// or string. Upstream writes `===` on the type objects, and that reproduces here because the checker
// interns types: probed over eight shapes, two `string` annotations in different declarations, two
// identical unions, two identical interfaces and two different string LITERALS after widening all
// answer identical pointers, while `number` against `string` does not. So this is a faithful port of
// upstream's comparison rather than a lookalike that happens to agree.
//
// The first pass reports each operand that is individually impossible: a symbol, a `never`, an
// `unknown`, an object, or one of the four kinds an `allow` option is switched off for. The second
// pass runs ONLY if the first found nothing, and reports the pair: a string added to a number under
// `allowNumberAndString: false`, or a number added to a bigint, which is a type error in any
// configuration.
//
// That ordering is why `hadIndividualComplaint` exists and why it is not a micro-optimisation.
// `symbol + 1` has an impossible operand AND a mismatched pair, and upstream reports only the
// operand. A port running both passes would report twice on a corpus that says once.
//
// # One flag test, not two, and the source reads as though there are two
//
// Upstream's body calls two differently named things: its own `isTypeFlagSetInUnion`, defined at the
// bottom of the rule file, and an `isTypeFlagSet` imported from `../util`. That reads as a deliberate
// distinction between a union-aware test and a plain one, and porting it that way is wrong.
//
// The imported one is `packages/type-utils/src/typeFlagUtils.ts`, and it is ALSO union-aware: it ORs
// the flags of every union constituent before testing. Its own doc comment says so and points at
// tsutils for the plain behaviour. So both spellings mean the same thing and every site here is
// union-aware.
//
// Two corpus cases are what caught this, and nothing else in the suite could have. `foo += 'data'`
// where `foo` is `string | null`, under `allowNullish: false`, reports upstream; a port using a
// plain flag test is silent, because the union itself carries neither the null flag nor the
// undefined one, only its members do. Probed directly on both cases: our checker answers
// `string | null`, plain flag false, union flag true, which is exactly upstream's own answer, so the
// divergence was in the port and not in the substrate.
//
// The single remaining plain `IsTypeFlagSet` is the early exit, which is upstream's `tsutils`
// import and genuinely plain: it tests a type already known to be identical on both sides.
//
// # The RegExp arm, which is neither of the above
//
// A RegExp is an object and carries the object flag, so the generic object test below would report
// it regardless of `allowRegExp`. Upstream therefore names it first, by TYPE NAME, and gives it a
// second condition the other arms do not have: a RegExp is reported even when allowed if the OTHER
// operand is number-like, because `/x/ + 1` is a number-and-string mixture wearing an object.
//
// # Where each finding points
//
// The two passes report at different nodes and that is the whole difference between them. An
// individual complaint points at the OPERAND, so a reader sees which side is wrong; a pair complaint
// points at the WHOLE expression, because neither side is wrong alone. Upstream's corpus records
// columns that pin both, and the fixtures assert the spans rather than only the ids.
//
// # Two different renderings of a type, and they are not interchangeable
//
// The RegExp arm identifies a type by `getTypeName`, the shelf helper that folds a string-like, an
// all-string union, a string-bearing intersection and a string-constrained type parameter all down
// to "string". Every MESSAGE, by contrast, renders with the checker's own `TypeToString`. Upstream
// draws exactly the same line and this port keeps it.
//
// Swapping every message to `getTypeName` SURVIVES the whole suite, and that verdict is correct
// rather than a fixture gap. The check is mechanical rather than an argument: enumerate the type
// names the corpus records across all 56 findings that carry data, and ask which of them the two
// functions render differently. The answer is none. The list holds `string | boolean`,
// `string | null`, `string | undefined` and `{ first: number; second: string; }`, none of which is a
// shape `getTypeName` rewrites, because a union is only folded when EVERY member is string and these
// each have a non-string member. The one entry the two could disagree about is `string` itself,
// where both return "string".
//
// Probed for a reaching input as well as reasoned about, since the enumeration only covers the
// corpus: an all-string union, a string-constrained type parameter, a string intersection and an
// unconstrained type parameter were each driven at the report sites under several configurations,
// and all six were clean, because a type this rule complains about individually is by construction
// not a plain string.
//
// So the two spellings are equivalent HERE and not in general, and upstream's is kept because the
// equivalence rests on which types can reach these four sites, which is exactly the kind of fact
// that stops being true when someone adds an arm.
//
// # Messages
//
// All three interpolate, and the `stringLike` slot is the elaborate one: it is assembled from which
// `allow` options are on, so the same finding reads differently under different configuration. The
// corpus records the rendered text for 56 findings across four distinct renderings of that slot, and
// the fixtures assert the rendered string rather than the message id, because no id assertion can
// see a format built this way.
