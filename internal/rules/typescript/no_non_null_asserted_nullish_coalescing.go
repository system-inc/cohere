// NoNonNullAssertedNullishCoalescing flags `x!` on the left of `??`.
//
//	valid:   foo ?? bar;
//	valid:   foo ?? bar!;                      the assertion is on the RIGHT, which says nothing
//	valid:   (foo ?? bar)!;                    the assertion wraps the whole expression
//	valid:   let x: string; x! ?? '';          never assigned, so the assertion may be load-bearing
//	invalid: foo! ?? bar;
//	invalid: foo.bazz! ?? bar;
//	invalid: let x = foo(); x! ?? '';
//
// The two operators contradict each other. `??` exists to handle a left side that may be null or
// undefined; `!` asserts it is neither. Writing both says "this cannot be nullish, and here is what
// to do when it is", so one of the two is wrong and the reader cannot tell which.
//
// # The repair is a SUGGESTION, and upstream explains why in a comment worth preserving
//
// Removing `!` can change the resulting TYPE, so it is offered rather than applied:
//
//	function test(x?: string): string {
//	  const bar = x! ?? false;   the analysis gives bar the type string
//	  //          x  ?? false;   the analysis gives bar the type string | false
//	  return bar;
//	}
//
// The nullish coalesce takes the right operand into its result only when the left CAN be nullish, so
// deleting the assertion can widen the type and break a return that used to compile. A fixer would
// do that unattended. This ships the same single suggestion upstream ships.
//
// # An identifier is treated differently from every other left side, and the reason is scope
//
// For a non-identifier left side, the rule reports unconditionally: `foo.bazz!`, `foo()!` and
// `foo!.bazz!` are always contradictions.
//
// For a bare identifier, upstream asks whether the variable has been ASSIGNED before this point,
// and stays silent when it has not:
//
//	let x: string; x! ?? '';               silent, x has no value yet
//	let x!: string; x! ?? '';              reports, the definite assertion counts as an assignment
//	let x = foo(); x! ?? '';               reports, the initializer counts
//	let x: string; x = foo(); x! ?? '';    reports, the write is above
//	let x: string; x! ?? ''; x = foo();    silent, the write is BELOW
//
// The reasoning is that a declared-but-unassigned variable is genuinely `undefined` at that point,
// so the assertion is doing something and the pair is not obviously a mistake. Six of upstream's
// eighteen passing cases and seven of its fifteen failing ones ride entirely on this test, so it is
// most of the rule rather than an edge.
//
// # Where upstream gets that from, and where this port gets it instead
//
// Upstream reads ESLint's scope manager: `findVariable`, then `variable.references` for a write
// whose identifier ends before this node, and `variable.defs` for a declarator that is `definite`
// or has an `init`.
//
// This tree has no scope manager, and it does not need one for this question. The same two halves
// are available from the checker and the syntax tree:
//
//	the definition half   the declaration node itself carries `Initializer` and `ExclamationToken`,
//	                      which are exactly `init != null` and `definite`
//	the reference half    walk the file for identifiers resolving to the SAME SYMBOL, and ask the
//	                      shelf's `reference.WritesToBinding` whether each one is a write
//
// This is the technique `no-unassigned-vars` and `no-class-assign` already use for the same
// question, and it is fidelity to what the rule DECIDES rather than to how upstream obtains it.
//
// Symbols are compared by identity rather than by indexing `Declarations[0]`. A symbol can carry
// several declarations, and taking the first would answer about the wrong one for a merged name;
// comparing the symbols themselves asks the question the rule actually has, which is "is this the
// same binding", not "which declaration is it".
//
// # What the suggestion removes, and why it is found by scanning rather than by arithmetic
//
// The edit removes the `!` token. Its position is not `node.End() - 1`: the assertion's own text can
// end in trivia, and the corpus has a case with two spaces between the name and the mark, whose
// repair must delete the mark and leave the spaces. Upstream finds the token with
// `getLastToken(node, isNonNullAssertionPunctuator)` for the same reason. Here the token is located
// by scanning from the inner expression's end, which finds the same byte.
//
// # Cost
//
// The anchor is a binary expression, which is common, and the operator test rejects everything but
// `??` on the second line. The file walk runs only for a bare identifier under a non-null assertion
// on the left of a nullish coalesce, which is rare enough that the corpus is most of its occurrences.
