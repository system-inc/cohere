		"literal itself. `as const` infers it, so the value and its type cannot drift apart; " +
		"writing the type out means every edit to the value has to be made twice, and the " +
		"compiler accepts the version where only one of them was.",

// PreferAsConst flags a literal type that merely restates the literal value beside it.
//
//	valid:   let foo = 'bar' as const;
//	valid:   let foo: string = 'bar';
//	valid:   let foo: 'bar' = 'baz';
//	invalid: let foo: 'bar' = 'bar';
//	invalid: let foo = 'bar' as 'bar';
//	invalid: class C { bar: 2 = 2; }
//
// Ported from oxc's `typescript/prefer-as-const`, which is itself a port of
// `@typescript-eslint/prefer-as-const`. Where the two disagree this follows oxc, because oxc is
// what the differential harness compares against. Three disagreements are recorded below.
//
// # Three anchors, and the positions that are deliberately not among them
//
// Upstream registers exactly three node kinds, and every other annotated position is out of scope
// rather than overlooked:
//
//	VariableDeclarator     let foo: 'bar' = 'bar'
//	PropertyDefinition     class C { bar: 'bar' = 'bar' }
//	TSAsExpression         'bar' as 'bar'
//
// Measured against the release binary, a parameter default (`function f(p: 'bar' = 'bar') {}`) and
// a generic argument (`g<'bar'>('bar')`) are both silent, and each has a fixture. They are the two
// positions a reader most expects to be covered, which is why they are pinned rather than left to
// the absence of a listener to imply.
//
// # oxc registers no TSTypeAssertion arm, and typescript-eslint does
//
// `let foo = <'bar'>'bar';` is reported by typescript-eslint and silent here. Upstream lists the
// three angle-bracket inputs among its failing cases, but its tester parses .tsx, where they are
// `Unexpected token` parse errors rather than rule findings, and its snapshot records them as such.
// That is the entirety of the extractor's "17 diagnostics against 20 inputs" warning.
//
// Measured in .ts, where the form parses cleanly, with a control rule firing on a neighbouring
// file: all three are silent. Upstream's own fix vectors for them are commented out, so the gap is
// known upstream rather than accidental. Reproduced as silence.
//
// # The comparison is on values, not on spellings
//
// oxc compares the parsed numbers (`(a - b).abs() < f64::EPSILON`) and the cooked string contents.
// typescript-eslint compares ESTree's `raw` text. So `let a: 0x10 = 16` reports here and would not
// there, as would `2 = 2.0`, `1_0 = 10` and `1e2 = 100`.
//
// No imported fixture separates the two readings, because the corpus writes only inputs where the
// spelling and the value agree. TestPreferAsConstMatchesNumericValuesNotSpellings is the fixture
// set that pins it, and it is invented rather than imported for exactly that reason.
//
// A parser is not needed for any of it. A NumericLiteral's Text field already holds the canonical
// rendering of the double it parsed to, so string equality on Text is the float comparison, and a
// StringLiteral's Text is the cooked value rather than the source spelling. Both were probed on the
// inputs above before this comparison was written.

// reportAnnotation handles the two arms that carry a separate type annotation.
//
// # Why the two-part edit is a fix rather than a suggestion
//
// This is the load-bearing decision in the rule, and it goes against the shape of the tree's
// warnings, so the reasoning is recorded rather than assumed.
//
// The repair is two edits at separated offsets: delete the annotation, and append ` as const` after
// the initializer. Our engine flattens a diagnostic's fixes into independent proposals, so a pair
// that only means something jointly is normally a Suggestion, whose Fixes field is the atomic
// container. core.NoCaseDeclarations is the shipped precedent.
//
// It is a fix here for two measured reasons.
//
// Upstream ships it as one. oxc calls diagnostic_with_fix, which is FixKind::SafeFix, on both arms,
// and there is no diagnostic_with_suggestion anywhere in the rule. Running the release binary with
// a bare --fix, which applies safe fixes only and never suggestions, rewrites every one of these
// inputs. So a port shipping a suggestion would decline to repair files upstream repairs unattended,
// which is a behavioral divergence rather than a conservative reading.
//
// (typescript-eslint does the opposite, and inverts the meaning of the same `canFix` parameter: it
// makes this arm a suggestion under a distinct message id and makes the as-expression arm the fix.
// oxc keeps one message id and fixes both. oxc wins.)
//
// And the halves cannot be separated in practice. The overlap resolver refuses a proposal that
// begins before the end of the previously kept one; these two are disjoint and ordered, because the
// initializer follows the annotation. The only edit that could land between them is this rule's own
// other arm, and the two arms are mutually exclusive on a single declarator: when the initializer is
// an AsExpression the annotation arm declines, because it compares the annotation against the
// initializer and the kinds disagree. `let foo: 'bar' = 'bar' as 'bar';` reports exactly once, which
// upstream's snapshot confirms and TestPreferAsConstReportsOnceWhenBothArmsCouldApply pins.
//
// Meaning is preserved: `let foo: 'bar' = 'bar'` and `let foo = 'bar' as const` give the variable
// the same type. That is the test the fix/suggestion split actually applies.
//
// # canRepair
//
// Upstream computes it as `matches!(id, BindingPattern::BindingIdentifier(_))`, so a destructuring
// target reports and offers nothing. It has to: deleting the annotation off `let []: 'bar' = 'bar'`
// and appending `as const` leaves a destructure of a string, which is a different program and would
// not compile. The absence of that input from upstream's fourteen fix vectors is the corpus saying
// the same thing.

//
// Only strings and numbers are matched. Upstream's match on TSLiteral falls through for every other
// variant, so a boolean (`let a: true = true`), a bigint (`let a: 2n = 2n`) and a negated number
// (`let a: -2 = -2`) are silent despite reading as the same shape. Each has a fixture.
//
// A parenthesized type is not a literal type. `let a: ('bar') = 'bar'` parses to ParenthesizedType
