// Ported from `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment`, the fourth of the `no-unsafe-*` family and
// the first that also has to reason about DESTRUCTURING. Every verdict below was measured against
// the installed 8.67.0 build driven over a real TypeScript program, one file per program.
//
// # 387 findings on the ahra tree
//
// Stated here because a number that size is a decision rather than a side effect. It is the largest
// this port has produced and the second largest of the porting wave. Nothing about the rule is
// approximate: the count was compared line for line against the installed build over the same files.
//
// # The shared judgment already existed, and three siblings use it
//
// `type_checking.IsUnsafeAssignment` is the recursive comparison that decides whether a sender type
// smuggles an `any` into a receiver's generic position. `no-unsafe-return`, `no-unsafe-argument` and
// `no-unsafe-type-assertion` all call it, and this rule is the fourth. Nothing in the comparison
// needed changing, which is the point of it living on the shelf: a fifth copy would be a fifth
// opinion about `Set<any>` into `Set<string>`.
//
// # Three comparison modes, and the distinction is what keeps inferred variables quiet
//
// `const x = 1 as any` is SILENT while `const x: string = 1 as any` reports, and the difference is
// not the value but whether a type was written down. With no annotation the variable's type IS the
// sender's, so a comparison would be asking whether a type differs from itself. Upstream expresses
// that as `ComparisonType.None`, and it is why the annotation is consulted before the types are.
//
// The contextual mode is for a position whose own type comes from the value: an object literal
// property and a JSX attribute both take their type from what is assigned, so asking the receiver's
// own type answers the sender's. Upstream asks for the contextual type there and falls back.
//
// # Destructuring is a recursion, and its findings are per element
//
// `const { a: { b } } = x` walks into the object pattern and then into the nested one, reporting on
// each element whose sender type is `any`. Two rules govern it and both are upstream's: an `any`
// element is reported and NOT descended into, so `[[[x]]] = [any]` reports once rather than three
// times, and a rest element is skipped entirely because it is not a one-to-one assignment.
//
// # A reported assignment suppresses the destructuring walk
//
// Upstream threads a `didReport` boolean through: if the plain assignment check reported, the
// destructuring helpers do not run. That is why `const { a } = 1 as any` produces ONE finding rather
// than one per destructured name. Reproduced, and it is the reason those helpers return a boolean
// rather than nothing.
//
// # `unknown` absorbs `any`
//
// Assigning `any` into `unknown` is the safe move, because `unknown` forces the receiver to narrow
// before use. Upstream returns early on it, and a port without that reports the most defensive thing
// a caller can write.
//
// # Measured against ESLint, and the three rows that differ are the checker's, not the rule's
//
// Run over the ahra tree, 132 files, this reports 435 and ESLint reports 432, with ZERO findings
// ESLint has that this misses. All three extra rows are the same shape:
//
//	const { value, done } = await reader.read();   // reader from fetch(...).body.getReader()
//
// ESLint's checker types that initializer `ReadableStreamReadResult<Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>>`;
// typescript-go's types it `ReadableStreamReadResult<any>`, so `value` really is `any` here and the
// rule reports what it is handed. The two `lib.dom.d.ts` files are byte-identical, so the difference
// is in generic resolution through `fetch`, above this rule.
//
// Two things pin that. A fourth site, `StreamTransforms.ts`, destructures the same call against a
// bare `ReadableStream` whose `R` defaults to `any`, and both tools report it, agreeing. And
// `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument`, ported separately and sharing no code with this file,
// independently reports an unsafe argument of type `any` for that same `value` at all three sites.
// Two unrelated rules reading the same checker see the same `any`.
//
// Nothing is special-cased for it. A rule that suppressed these would be lying about what its own
// checker knows, and would go silent if the resolution is later fixed.
