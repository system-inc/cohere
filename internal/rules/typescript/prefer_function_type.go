// PreferFunctionType flags an interface or type literal whose only member is a call signature.
//
//	valid:   interface Foo { (): void; bar: number; }
//	valid:   interface Foo extends Bar { (): void; }
//	valid:   type Foo = { (): void; new (): Bar; };
//	invalid: interface Foo { (): string; }              type Foo = () => string;
//	invalid: type Foo = { (): string; };                type Foo = () => string;
//	invalid: interface Foo<T> { (bar: T): string; }     type Foo<T> = (bar: T) => string;
//
// A one-member interface holding only a call signature is a function type wearing four extra lines
// of syntax. `type Foo = () => string` says the same thing, reads at a glance, and does not invite
// a reader to look for the other members.
//
// # Two messages, and the second one exists to avoid giving bad advice
//
// The ordinary finding is `functionTypeOverCallableType`. But an interface whose signature mentions
// `this` cannot be rewritten as a function type without changing what `this` means, so the rule
// swaps in `unexpectedThisOnFunctionOnlyInterface`, points at the `this` rather than the member,
// and offers no repair. Upstream reports only the FIRST `this` when there are several, deliberately,
// so the reader gets one message instead of a pile.
//
// A `this` inside a NESTED type literal does not count, because that code is already invalid
// TypeScript and upstream declines to claim the `this` refers to the interface when the compiler
// says it refers to nothing.
//
// # Three shape differences from the tree upstream walks, all measured
//
// `export interface Foo` is an ExportNamedDeclaration wrapping an interface upstream, and here it is
// an interface CARRYING a modifier. Same for `export default`. Upstream's fixable test reads
// `node.parent.type === ExportDefaultDeclaration` and its comment relocation reads
// `node.parent.type === ExportNamedDeclaration`; both are modifier tests here, and a port copying
// the parent test would never fire either branch.
//
// An interface's `extends` entry is a `KindTypeReference` here and an expression upstream. Probed
// rather than assumed, after the first version of this rule's probe crashed on the assumption: the
// `Function` test has to read a type reference's name, not an expression.
//
// A member's `Pos()` includes its leading comment and the newline before it, while upstream's
// `member.range[0]` is the token start with comments fetched separately. The fixer below takes the
// member text from `rule.TokenRange` for exactly this reason; using `Pos()` would fold the comment
// into the text and then insert it a second time.
//
// # The repair, and the one case it declines
//
// The rewrite turns `(args): Return` into `(args) => Return`, wraps the result in parentheses when
// the surrounding type is a union, intersection, or array, and for an interface rebuilds the whole
// declaration as a type alias carrying the original type parameters. Comments attached to the
// member move with it, and for an exported interface they move ABOVE the export rather than
// between `export` and `type`, which is the only place they are still legal.
//
// Upstream declines to fix `export default interface`, because the replacement would have to become
// `export default type`, which is not a thing. That decline is reproduced.
//
// One further decline is this port's own, and it is stated rather than silent. A member separated by
// a COMMA rather than a semicolon is legal, and upstream's fixer only strips a semicolon, so
// `type Foo = { (): string, };` is rewritten to `type Foo = () => string,;`. Measured on the
// installed 8.67.0 build and then handed to the TypeScript parser, which rejects it with
// "';' expected". The finding is reproduced and the repair is withheld, because a fix is applied
// unattended and this one turns working code into a syntax error.
