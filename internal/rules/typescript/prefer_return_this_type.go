// PreferReturnThisType flags a class method or property function annotated with the class's own
// name where every value it returns is the receiver, because `this` says the same thing and keeps
// saying it in a subclass.
//
//	valid:   class Foo { f(): this { return this; } }
//	valid:   class Foo { f(): Foo { return new Foo(); } }
//	valid:   class Base {} class Derived extends Base { f(): Base { return this; } }
//	invalid: class Foo { f(): Foo { return this; } }
//	invalid: class Foo { f = (): Foo => this; }
//
// The annotation `Foo` and the annotation `this` describe the same values inside `Foo`, and they
// stop agreeing the moment anybody subclasses it. `class Bar extends Foo {}` gives `bar.f()` the
// static type `Foo`, so the chain `bar.f().barOnly()` fails to compile even though the value really
// is a `Bar`. Writing `this` instead makes the return type polymorphic and the chain works. That is
// why upstream ships this as a fix rather than a suggestion: the rewrite widens what the caller can
// do and takes nothing away.
//
// # The judgment is type identity, not name matching, and both halves are load-bearing
//
// Upstream compares the returned expression's type against two REFERENCE-identical types: the
// class's own declared type, and that type's `thisType`. Name matching would be wrong in both
// directions and the corpus pins each:
//
//	class Base {} class Derived extends Base { f(): Base { return this; } }
//	                          silent: `Base` names a real supertype, and rewriting to `this` would
//	                          narrow the signature rather than widen it
//	class Foo { f(): Foo { const self = this; return self; } }
//	                          REPORTS: `self` has no annotation so it keeps the `this` type, and the
//	                          name in the return statement is not `this` at all
//
// So the rule reads the returned expression's type through the checker rather than its syntax, and
// the only syntactic shortcut it keeps is upstream's own: a bare `this` keyword is accepted without
// asking, which is a cost optimization and not a separate judgment.
//
// # Two returns disagree, and the class type wins
//
// A body that returns both `this` and a fresh instance is silent, and upstream's bookkeeping says
// why: `hasReturnClassType` is checked with priority over `hasReturnThis`, so one return of the
// class type disqualifies the whole method however many returns of `this` sit beside it. Measured:
//
//	class Foo { f(): Foo { if (1) return new Foo(); return this; } }        silent
//	class Foo { f(): Foo { if (1) return; return this; } }                  REPORTS
//
// The second one reports because a bare `return;` has no expression at all, so it is skipped rather
// than counted as returning something that is not `this`. The union arm does the same job for
// `Foo | string`: a returned value whose type is a union containing the class type also sets
// `hasReturnClassType`, which is what makes upstream's last passing case silent while its
// near-identical last failing case reports. The two differ only in whether the union member is the
// class or a primitive.
//
// # Where the returns are looked for, and where they deliberately are not
//
// `ast.ForEachReturnStatement` descends through statement containers only: blocks, `if`, loops,
// `switch`, `try`, labels. It does not enter a nested function or arrow, and neither does
// upstream's `forEachReturnStatement`, whose case list this matches statement for statement.
// Verified by reading both: `typescript-go/tsc/internal/ast/utilities.go:1157` and
// `typescript-eslint/packages/eslint-plugin/src/util/astUtils.ts:52` carry the same fifteen kinds,
// because both descend from the TypeScript compiler's own helper.
//
// That shared omission is a behavior rather than an oversight, and it is the right one: a `return
// this` inside a callback returns from the callback, not from the method. Measured on the installed
// 8.67.0 build, `class Foo { f(): Foo { [1].forEach(() => { return this; }); return this; } }`
// reports on the strength of its OUTER return, and removing that outer return makes it silent.
//
// # Parentheses, and the reason this rule reads TWO trees
//
// This is the one part of the port that is not a transcription, and getting it wrong cost this port
// two false positives before a probe caught them.
//
// typescript-eslint's rule straddles two trees. It reads the estree tree for the return TYPE, where
// there is no parenthesized-expression node at all, and it reads the TYPESCRIPT tree for the return
// VALUE, through `services.esTreeNodeToTSNodeMap`, where parentheses survive exactly as they do
// here. So a parenthesis is invisible on one side and load-bearing on the other, and our parser
// matches upstream on the second side already.
//
// What that means at each site, all measured against the installed 8.67.0 build:
//
//	RETURN VALUE, expression position: DO NOT unwrap.
//	  Upstream's `expr.kind === ts.SyntaxKind.ThisKeyword` is tested on the TypeScript node, so
//	  `return (this);` is not that keyword upstream either and falls through to the type comparison.
//	  In an ordinary method that comparison succeeds and the case reports; in a static body or a
//	  function expression it fails and the case is SILENT. An earlier revision of this rule
//	  unwrapped here, which made the keyword arm fire on shapes the comparison would have declined,
//	  and reported `static f(): Foo { return (this); }` and
//	  `f = function (): Foo { return (this); }` where upstream reports nothing. Both are now pinned
//	  as silent, beside their unparenthesized siblings which report.
//
//	CONCISE BODY of an arrow: unwrap.
//	  `func.body` on the TypeScript node is the parenthesized expression, and upstream compares the
//	  CHECKER's answer for it rather than testing a node kind. A parenthesized expression has the
//	  type of its operand, so upstream's comparison sees through the parens and ours must too. This
//	  is a checker question, so the unwrap is inert for the verdict and kept only so the code reads
//	  the same as the arm above; `(): Foo => (this)` reports either way.
//
//	RETURN TYPE, type position: unwrap, and it is required.
//	  `f(): (Foo | undefined) | null` goes silent without it, because the search here is SYNTACTIC:
//	  it walks type nodes looking for an identifier, and a parenthesized type node is not a type
//	  reference however transparent it is to the checker. A mutant disabling it fails a fixture.
//
// The rule that falls out is worth more than the three instances: unwrap before a question you put
// to the CHECKER, never before a question you put to a node KIND, because upstream's own keyword
// tests run on a tree that kept the parentheses.
//
// The unwraps that remain are loops rather than single steps, because `((this))` nests, and are
// written out rather than routed through `ast.SkipParentheses`, which dereferences its argument
// while a concise body is optional.
//
// # What upstream does not catch, reproduced rather than improved
//
// An intersection is invisible to upstream's `tryGetNameInType`, which recurses through unions and
// nothing else, so `f(): Foo & {}` is silent even though it is the same mistake. Measured on the
// installed build and reproduced here. Widening the search to intersections would be a defensible
// rule and it would not be this rule.
//
// A qualified name is likewise invisible: `f(): N.Foo` inside `namespace N` is silent because the
// type node's `typeName` is a qualified name rather than an identifier. Measured.
//
// # What the repair writes
//
// One edit replacing the matched type reference with `this`, and the reference's own text includes
// its type arguments: `Animal<T>` becomes `this`, not `this<T>`. Upstream anchors the report on the
// same node it rewrites, so the span and the edit are the same range and a reader is always shown
// the text that is about to change.
//
// A union with the class name written twice reports ONCE and rewrites ONCE, leaving the second
// occurrence. `f(): Foo | Foo` becomes `f(): this | Foo` in a single pass. Upstream's own tester
// shows `this | this` only because `verifyAndFix` re-lints until the source stops changing;
// measured against a single application of the same messages, upstream writes `this | Foo` too.
// This port is a single pass and matches it.
