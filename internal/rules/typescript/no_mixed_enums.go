// noMixedEnumsMemberType is the three-way classification upstream calls AllowedType.

// `Unknown` is not "we could not tell". It is a real third verdict that ABORTS the whole enum: a
// member whose initializer is a boolean literal makes upstream stop scanning rather than treat the
// member as either kind, so `enum E { A = 1, B = false, C = 'c' }` is silent even though the first
// and third members plainly disagree. Measured on the installed rule, which is the only way to
// learn it, because reading the source shows a `return` inside a loop and not what it costs.

//	invalid: enum E { A = 1 } enum E { B = 'b' }
//
// A numeric enum member gets a reverse mapping in the emitted object and a string member does not,
// so a mixed enum makes `E[E.A]` work for some members and return undefined for others. The rule is
// about that asymmetry rather than about taste.
//
// # What decides a finding
//
// One listener on `KindEnumDeclaration`. An empty body is declined first. Then a DESIRED type is
// established for the whole declaration, and the members are scanned in order; the first member
// disagreeing with the desired type reports, and the scan stops. Measured: an enum with three
// disagreeing members reports ONCE, on the first of them, not three times.
//
// The desired type comes from the first of these that answers, and the order is upstream's:
//
//	an imported merge     a `declare module` augmenting an enum imported from elsewhere takes the
//	                      kind from THAT enum's first member
//	an earlier sibling    a previous non-empty `enum E` in the same scope, textually before this one
//	a namespace merge     an exported enum inside a namespace block, merged with another block
//	this enum itself      the kind of its own first member
//
// # The `Unknown` verdict aborts, and it is not a fallback
//
// A member classifies as Unknown only when its initializer is a literal that is neither a number
// nor a string, which in practice means a boolean. Reaching one abandons the entire declaration.
// Measured, holding everything else fixed:
//
//	enum E { A = 1, B = false }              CLEAN
//	enum E { A = 1, B = false, C = 'c' }     CLEAN   (the string never gets judged)
//	enum E { A = 1, C = 'c' }                REPORTS (control: the pair alone does disagree)
//
// The third row is the control. Without it the first two read as "booleans are numbers", which is
// the intuitive reading and the wrong one.
//
// # Number is the type that can be ADOPTED, and string is not
//
// Upstream writes `desiredType ??= currentType` guarded by `currentType === Number`. That asymmetry
// only bites when the desired type is still unset, which happens when the first member's
// initializer is a call or another expression the literal switch does not name. Measured:
//
//	declare const f: () => any;
//	enum E { A = f(), B = 1, C = 'c' }       REPORTS on `'c'`
//
// `A` takes the checker arm and comes back Number, `B` is Number, and `C` disagrees. A port that
// skipped the adoption line would have no desired type at `C` and go silent.
//
// # Parentheses, and why this port skips them while upstream has no code for it
//
// ESTree does not represent a parenthesis as a node, so upstream's `member.initializer.type`
// switch is handed the INNER node for `A = (1)` and its Literal arm fires. Our parser produces a
// real `KindParenthesizedExpression`, so a literal port of that switch would fall through to the
// checker arm on every parenthesized initializer and classify a parenthesized boolean as Number
// instead of Unknown.
//
// That is a parser difference rather than a rule difference. Measured on the installed rule, with
// the bare forms as controls on each row:
//
//	enum E { A = 'a', B = (1) }        REPORTS on `1`, span EXCLUDES the parens
//	enum E { A = 'a', B = (false) }    CLEAN    -- same as the bare `false`
//	enum E { A = 'a', B = false }      CLEAN    (control)
//
// The second row is the one that settles it: if parentheses routed to the checker arm, a
// parenthesized boolean would classify as Number and REPORT. It does not, so upstream is seeing
// through the parenthesis to the literal, and skipping is what reproduces the decision. Confirmed
// directly against the parser as well: `A = (1)` yields a `Literal` node whose range is the inner
// `1`, which is also why the span excludes the wrapper.
//
// # A template literal is a string even with a substitution
//
// Upstream's switch names `TemplateLiteral` and returns String without inspecting it, so a member
// initialized to a template carrying a substitution is a string member regardless of what the
// substituted expression's type is. Reproduced rather than improved on: asking the checker would
// be more careful and would disagree with the rule being ported.
//
// # The merge cases, and what replaces the scope manager
//
// Upstream walks `context.sourceCode.getScope(node)` upward, reading the resolved variable's
// definitions to find both an earlier sibling declaration and any import bindings. We have no
// scope manager, and the checker answers the same question: the enum's own name resolves to a
// symbol whose `Declarations` is the merged list, which is exactly what upstream reconstructs.
//
// Three properties of that list were measured rather than assumed, because the brief's warning
// about `Declarations[0]` applies directly here:
//
//	enum E { A = 1 } enum E { B = 'b' }                  REPORTS on `'b'`  (earlier sibling wins)
//	enum E { A = 'a' } enum E { B = 1 }                  REPORTS on `1`
//	enum E {} enum E { A = 1, B = 'b' }                  REPORTS on `'b'`  (empty one is skipped)
//	enum E { A = 1 } enum E { B = 'b' } enum E { C = 2 } REPORTS on `'b'` ONLY
//
// The fourth row is the one a reader would not predict: the third declaration is judged against
// the FIRST, not against the second, because upstream takes the earliest non-empty declaration
// positioned before it and stops. It agrees with the first, so it is clean, and only the middle
// one reports.
//
// A non-exported enum inside a namespace does not merge and is judged on its own; measured CLEAN
// for a pair that would otherwise disagree.
//
// # Cost
//
// `KindEnumDeclaration` is a rare anchor. The checker is consulted once for the declaration's own
// name, and once per member whose initializer is not a literal the switch already names.
