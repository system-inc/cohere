// NoUnnecessaryQualifier flags a namespace or enum qualifier that names the scope you are already in.
//
//	valid:   namespace X { export type T = number; } namespace Y { export const x: X.T = 3; }
//	valid:   namespace X { export type T = number; namespace Y { type T = string; const x: X.T = 0; } }
//	valid:   enum Foo { One } namespace Foo { export function bar() { return Foo.One; } }
//	invalid: namespace A { export type B = number; const x: A.B = 3; }
//	invalid: namespace A { export const x = 3; export const y = A.x; }
//	invalid: enum A { B, C = A.B }
//
// Writing `A.B` from inside `A` says something the reader has to check: it looks like a reach into
// another namespace and it is not. The name is already in scope, so the qualifier adds letters and
// removes the signal that a qualifier is supposed to carry.
//
// # Three questions, and each one can decline
//
// A qualifier is unnecessary only when all three hold. The qualifier resolves to a symbol whose
// declaration is one of the namespaces or enums this node is lexically inside. The accessed name
// resolves to a symbol. And the name the checker finds in scope AT THE QUALIFIER is the same symbol
// the access resolved to, compared through `GetExportSymbolOfSymbol` because a namespace member's
// local symbol and its exported symbol are different objects.
//
// That last comparison is the whole rule and it is what makes the shadowing case clean:
//
//	namespace X { export type T = number; namespace Y { type T = string; const x: X.T = 0; } }
//
// `T` IS in scope at that point, and it is the wrong `T`. Measured with a probe: the scope lookup
// finds a `T` and the export-symbol comparison answers false, so dropping the comparison would
// report a qualifier that is load-bearing and the fix would change what the code means.
//
// # The nesting suppression, and why this port drops the subtree rather than tracking a flag
//
// Upstream keeps a `currentFailedNamespaceExpression` set on report and cleared on the reported
// node's `:exit`, so a finding on `A.B.C.D` suppresses the nested findings on `A.B.C` and `A.B`. We
// have no exit visitor, and we do not need one: this rule does its own recursive walk, so declining
// to recurse into a node it just reported is the same suppression expressed as control flow.
//
// The equivalence is not free and was probed rather than assumed. What upstream suppresses is
// everything inside the reported node's subtree, so the two differ if a reportable qualifier can
// live inside a reported one without being part of its qualifier chain. The candidate shape is a
// type argument:
//
//	namespace A { export type B<T> = T; export type C = number; const x: A.B<A.C> = 3; }
//
// Measured: both report, because a type reference's arguments are children of the TYPE REFERENCE
// and not of the qualified name, in our parser as in estree. So the subtree of a reported
// `KindQualifiedName` or `KindPropertyAccessExpression` holds nothing but its own chain, and
// skipping it is exactly upstream's suppression.
//
// # What our harness cannot reach
//
// Upstream's ninth reporting case is `import * as Foo from './foo'; declare module './foo' { const
// x: Foo.T = 3; }`, which needs `./foo` to resolve so the namespace import aliases to a real module
// symbol. Driven through the installed 8.67.0 build with no `./foo` on disk, UPSTREAM IS SILENT
// TOO, so this is a case whose verdict depends on a module existing rather than a shape our harness
// cannot express. The alias branch it exercises is reached by a different fixture, recorded there.
//
// # Cost
//
// One walk of the file, and the checker is asked only at a qualified name or a non-computed
// property access whose object is an entity name. Most files have neither.
