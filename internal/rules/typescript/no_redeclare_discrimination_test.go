// TestPartitionAndKindSeparatesAllTwentyThree runs the exact 23 cases from the earlier identity
// probe through the SHIPPED rule, and ASSERTS rather than logging.
//
// The earlier probe scored "distinct symbol identity" alone and disagreed with upstream on 7 of
// these 23: five false negatives where duplicate var, function and enum declarations share one
// symbol, and two false positives where the same name in two non-overlapping scopes gets two
// symbols. That probe only called t.Logf, so it passed while carrying every one of those
// disagreements, which is the same shape as a measurement that never ran.
//
// The shipped rule does not use symbol identity at all, which is why those 7 are not its problem.
// Grep it: no GetSymbolAtLocation, no symbol comparison, only prose in the doc comment. It groups
// declaration NODES by their enclosing scope and then reads the declaration KINDS in the group. The
// two false positives are answered by the partition, and the five false negatives are answered by
// the kind arithmetic, because a var beside a var is not a member of any merge set.
//
// The `want` column is what the installed @typescript-eslint 8.67.0 rule does, driven case by case
// through the ESLint Linter API with a control firing.

// pairing reports. Verified against the installed build case by case rather than read off the source.
