// NoUselessEmptyExport flags an `export {}` in a file that is already a module.
//
//	valid:   export {}
//	valid:   export = 3; export {}
//	valid:   declare module '_'
//	invalid: export const value = 1; export {}
//	invalid: import '_'; export {}
//
// Ported from oxc's `no_useless_empty_export`, which is what the gate runs.
//
// # The whole rule is which statements make a file a module
//
// A lone `export {}` is the standard way to force module scope on a file that would otherwise be a
// script sharing the global namespace, so deleting one is a semantic change rather than a tidy-up.
// The rule fires only once something *else* in the file has already made it a module, at which
// point the empty export is genuinely inert.
//
// The set of statements that disarm it is the entire rule, it is not derivable from the phrase "any
// top-level import or export", and every member of it below was measured against the release binary
// rather than reasoned from the source. Four results are the opposite of the intuitive reading:
//
//	declare const a = 2; export {}          REPORTS NOT — an ambient declaration exports nothing
//	declare module 'x' {} export {}         REPORTS NOT — likewise, and it is the corpus's first pass case
//	interface I {} export {}                REPORTS NOT — a bare type declaration is local
//	export = 3; export {}                   REPORTS NOT — see the export-assignment section below
//
// against the ones that do disarm it:
//
//	export const _ = {}; export {}          reports — an export modifier on any declaration
//	export type A = 1; export {}            reports — a type-only export still exports a name
//	export declare const a = 2; export {}   reports — `declare` does not cancel `export`
//	export namespace N {} export {}         reports
//	const _ = {}; export { _ }; export {}   reports — a named export clause carrying specifiers
//	export * from '_'; export {}            reports — a star re-export
//	export default 3; export {}             reports
//	import '_'; export {}                   reports — even a bare side-effect import
//	import type { A } from '_'; export {}   reports
//	import _ = require('_'); export {}       reports — an external import-equals, top level only
//	import x = ns.value; export {}          REPORTS NOT — an internal import-equals is not external
//
// # `export default` and `export =` are one node kind here, and they fall opposite ways
//
// ESTree keeps these apart as `ExportDefaultDeclaration` and `TSExportAssignment`. typescript-go
// parses both to `KindExportAssignment` and separates them with the `IsExportEquals` flag alone.
// That distinction is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, because oxc counts a default export (its
// module record's `export_default`) and counts `export =` nowhere at all: an export assignment is
// absent from all six collections the original tests. So `export default 3; export {}` reports and
// `export = 3; export {}` does not, and a port reading only the node kind gets one of them wrong.
//
// The corpus looks like it says something stronger and does not. Its pass case
// `export * from '_'; export = {}` reads as evidence that an export assignment suppresses the rule
// even alongside a star export. It is not evidence about this rule at all: that input is a
// TypeScript semantic error, "an export assignment cannot be used in a module with other exported
// elements", and oxlint stops before the rule ever runs. Measured directly, the silence is decided
// above the rule the same way a suppression comment would decide it. The rule-level truth is the
// simpler one: an export assignment contributes nothing, so `import '_'; export = 3; export {}`
// does report, on the strength of the import alone.
//
// # An import-equals counts only at the top level, and only when external
//
// The original reaches past its module record for exactly one case, and it scans
// `nodes.program().body` rather than the whole tree. That top-level restriction is real and
// measured: `namespace Foo { import Bar = require('_'); } export {}` is silent even though the
// nested reference is external. The corpus writes the internal-reference form of the same shape as
// a pass case, which would pass either way, so only the probe separates them.
//
// # A `.d.ts` file is exempt entirely
//
// In a declaration file an `export {}` is how the module is kept properly encapsulated, so it is
// load-bearing even when other exports are present. The original gates on the file extension before
// doing any work, and its second tester block is four inputs that all report as `.ts` and all stay
// silent as `.d.ts`. Those four are the only thing pinning the gate, so they are kept here twice,
// once per extension.
