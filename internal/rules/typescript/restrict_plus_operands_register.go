// The Decode entry is required and the reason is sharper than "the rule takes options". Five of the
// six default to TRUE, so a rule reaching the zero-valued struct forbids everything and reports most
// of a real tree. `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` binds the *bool fields, which is what keeps an absent key
// distinguishable from an explicit false, and the settings resolver applies the defaults on nil.
