// TestNoUnnecessaryTypeConstraintSuggestionsWriteWhatTheyClaim is upstream's own twenty-four fix

// This test is not optional and it is not covered by the two above. The rule proposes a repair, and
// a repair is the one part of a rule that rewrites a file; an assertion on the message id is
// satisfied by a correct detection carrying a suggestion that deletes the wrong range. Widening the
// replaced span here leaves every id and every span assertion in this file green, which was
// confirmed by mutation rather than assumed.
//
// The vectors are also the artifact the extractor cannot see. It recognizes the tuple form of
// upstream's fix table and prints nothing for the `ExpectFixTestCase` form this rule uses, so its
// summary reports no fix count at all and the rule reads as repair-free. They were pulled out of the
// Rust source separately.
//
// # These are suggestions rather than fixes, which is a decision and not a formality
//
// oxc calls `ctx.diagnostic_with_suggestion` and declares `suggestion` in its metadata, so the
// engine does not apply this unattended. Confirmed against the release binary rather than read off
// the source: running `oxlint --fix` over every shape below changes not one byte, and
// `--fix-suggestions` rewrites all of them.
//
// The distinction is earned. Removing `extends any` cannot change what a type parameter means, so
// it reads like a fix, but the repair has to add a comma in some files and not others precisely
// because deleting the constraint can change how the file *parses*. A repair whose correctness
// depends on the filename is one a human should look at.
//
// `rule_testing.ExpectFixedSource` applies fixes and this rule proposes none, so the repair is applied
// here by hand. The application is deliberately trivial: one suggestion carrying one fix, sliced
// into the source. Anything cleverer would be testing the applier rather than the rule.
