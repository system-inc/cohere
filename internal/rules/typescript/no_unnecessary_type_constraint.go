// NoUnnecessaryTypeConstraint flags a generic type parameter constrained to `any` or `unknown`.

//	valid:   function data<T>() {}
//	valid:   function data<T extends number>() {}
//	valid:   function data<T extends any | number>() {}
//	valid:   type X = any; function data<T extends X>() {}
//	invalid: function data<T extends any>() {}
//	invalid: interface Data<T extends unknown> {}
//	invalid: class Data { member<T extends unknown>() {} }
//
// Ported from `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-constraint` by way of oxc's
// `typescript/no_unnecessary_type_constraint`.
//
// # The set of unnecessary constraints is exactly two, and it was measured rather than reasoned
//
// oxc destructures two variants and continues on everything else, so only the bare `any` and
// `unknown` keywords report. The neighbouring candidates a reader expects to behave the same way do
// not, and each was pinned against the release binary rather than argued from the source:
//
//	function data<T extends {}>() {}          silent
//	function data<T extends object>() {}      silent
//	function data<T extends never>() {}       silent
//	function data<T extends void>() {}        silent
//	function data<T extends any | number>() {}  silent, and upstream ships this as a pass case
//	type X = any; function data<T extends X>() {}  silent, also an upstream pass case
//
// The last two are the interesting ones and they say the same thing twice: the decision is made on
// the *syntax* of the constraint, not on the type it denotes. A union containing `any` collapses to
// `any` and an alias for `any` resolves to `any`, so a rule reasoning about types would report both.
// Upstream reasons about the parse tree, needs no checker to do it, and this port does the same.
//
// # Parentheses, measured in the direction that matters
//
// `function data<T extends (any)>() {}` is silent upstream, because a parenthesized type is a
// `TSParenthesizedType` there and the destructure declines it. Our parser agrees: it produces a
// `KindParenthesizedType` wrapping the keyword. So the faithful port is to *withhold* a
// parenthesis skip rather than to add one. This is written down because skipping parentheses reads
// as a free correctness improvement and adding it here would ship a silent divergence upstream's
// own corpus cannot see, since the corpus writes no parenthesized constraint at all.

				//
				// Reported through the node helper rather than with `name.Loc`, and that is the
				// difference between pointing at `U` and pointing at ` U`. A node's `Pos()` starts
				// at the end of the previous token, so it swallows the whitespace after the comma
				// in `<T, U extends any>`; `ReportNode*` routes through `TokenRange`, which starts
				// at the token itself. Upstream's snapshot puts this finding at column 18, which is
				// the `U`. The first parameter in a list has no leading trivia to swallow, so a
				// range built from `Pos()` looks right on every single-parameter case and only the
				// second parameter exposes it.

// trailingCommaForConstraintRemoval answers what to write over the deleted constraint: a comma, or
// nothing.
//
// This exists because deleting the constraint can change how the file parses. In a file where `<`
// is ambiguous between a generic parameter list and a JSX element, `const data = <T extends any>()
// => {};` parses as a generic arrow only because the `extends` proves it is not JSX. Remove the
// constraint and `<T>` reads as an opening JSX tag, so the repair has to leave behind the other
// disambiguator TypeScript accepts, a trailing comma: `const data = <T,>() => {};`.
//
// All five of upstream's conditions are reproduced, and each was pinned by applying the repair with
// the release binary's `--fix-suggestions` rather than read off the source:
//
//	.ts  const data = <T extends any>() => {};              becomes <T>          no comma
//	.tsx const data = <T extends any>() => {};              becomes <T,>         comma
//	.mts const data = <T extends any>() => {};              becomes <T,>         comma
//	.cts const data = <T extends any>() => {};              becomes <T,>         comma
//	.tsx function data<T extends any>() {}                  becomes <T>          not an arrow
//	.tsx const data = <T extends any = unknown>() => {};    becomes <T = unknown> has a default
//	.tsx const data = <T extends any, U extends any>() => {}; becomes <T, U>      two parameters
//	.tsx const data = <T extends any,>() => {};             becomes <T,>         comma already there
//
// The default case is not an oversight upstream is carrying: `<T = unknown>` is already unambiguous
// because `=` cannot appear in a JSX tag, so no comma is needed.
//
// # Finding an existing comma needs no scan, because the parser already excluded the comments
//
// oxc searches the source between the parameter's end and the declaration's end for a `,`, and
// filters out any hit that falls inside a comment. Probing our own nodes first, as the shelf rule
// says to, showed the parser has already done that work: the type parameter list's range ends after
// a real trailing comma and stops before a comment, so the text between the parameter's end and the
// list's end contains a comma only when a real one is there.
//
// Pinned on the input that separates the two spellings, `const data = <T extends any /* , */>() =>
// {};`, where a naive text search finds the comma inside the comment and would suppress the one the
// repair owes. The release binary rewrites it to `const data = <T, /* , */>() => {};`, adding a
// comma, and so does this.
