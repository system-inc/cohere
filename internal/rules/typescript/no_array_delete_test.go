// TestNoArrayDeleteSpans asserts where each finding points, by slicing the source with the

// ExpectFindings asserts message ids and a count and NOTHING else, so a rule pointing at the wrong
// node passes a complete fixture pair while being wrong. That is not hypothetical for an adapted
// rule: the adapter's node-report forms once passed raw node.Loc, which includes leading trivia, so
// an indented statement reported text beginning at the end of the previous line. It reaches a user
// as a caret on the wrong line and no message id fixture can see it.
//
// The eighteen cases here are every upstream invalid case that records an explicit Line, Column and
// EndColumn. Those three numbers are converted to the text they select, so what is asserted below
// is tsgolint's own recorded span rather than a span I chose. All eighteen select the WHOLE delete
// expression, `delete` keyword included, which is what makes the four cases at column eleven worth
// keeping: they are indented inside a function body, so a trivia-including range would begin on the
// line above and they are the ones that would catch a regression.
//
// The four upstream cases that record no position are covered by the suggestion outputs instead,
// which pin three exact byte ranges each and are strictly stronger than a span assertion.
