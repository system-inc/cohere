// PreferReduceTypeParameter flags a type assertion on the initial value of `Array#reduce` where a
// type argument on `reduce` itself would say the same thing.
//
//	valid:   [1, 2, 3].reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
//	valid:   [1, 2, 3].reduce<number[]>((a, s) => a.concat(s * 2), []);
//	valid:   ['a', 'b'].reduce((accum, name) => ({ ...accum }), {} as Record<'a' | 'b', boolean>);
//	invalid: [1, 2, 3].reduce((a, s) => a.concat(s * 2), [] as number[]);
//	invalid: [1, 2, 3].reduce((a, s) => a.concat(s * 2), <number[]>[]);
//
// `reduce` is generic in its accumulator, so `reduce<T>(callback, initial)` tells the checker what
// the accumulator is and then checks the initial value AGAINST it. Writing `initial as T` instead
// tells the checker to stop checking: the assertion is believed rather than verified, so a mistake
// in the initial value survives to run time. The two spellings look equivalent and only one of them
// is still type-checked.
//
// # Why some assertions are left alone, and it is not a style judgment
//
// Upstream reports only when the assertion is UNNECESSARY, meaning the un-asserted initial value is
// already assignable to the asserted type. When it is not assignable, the assertion is doing real
// widening work and rewriting it into a type parameter would produce code that does not compile,
// so the rule declines rather than proposing a fix it knows is broken.
//
// That single test is what separates four of upstream's passing cases from cases that otherwise
// look identical:
//
//	{} as Record<'a' | 'b', boolean>            silent: {} is missing 'a' and 'b'
//	{ a: true, b: false, c: true } as Record<'a' | 'b', boolean>
//	                                            silent: excess property 'c'
//	{} as T   where T extends Record<...>       silent: T could be a narrower subtype
//	{} as Record<string, boolean>               REPORTS: {} really is assignable
//
// So the assignability question is load-bearing rather than an optimization, and a port that
// skipped it would report all four and ship a fixer that breaks the build on three of them.
//
// # The receiver has to be an array, and a union is judged constituent by constituent
//
// Upstream's `isArrayType` is `unionConstituents(t).every(part => intersectionConstituents(part)
// .every(inner => isArrayType(inner) || isTupleType(inner)))`. A tuple counts, which is why
// `declare const tuple: [number, number, number]` reports while `tuple | Reducer` does not, and an
// intersection has to be all arrays too, which is why `number[] & Reducer` is silent. The receiver
// type comes from `GetConstrainedTypeAtLocation` so `U extends T[]` walks to its constraint.
//
// # What the repair writes, measured rather than reasoned
//
// The fix removes the assertion's syntax around the value and, when the call has no type arguments
// of its own, inserts `<AssertedType>` after the callee. Three separate edits, and the third is
// conditional. Measured against the installed 8.67.0 build:
//
//	a.reduce(cb, [] as number[])              -> a.reduce<number[]>(cb, [])
//	a.reduce(cb, <number[]>[])                -> a.reduce<number[]>(cb, [])
//	a.reduce<string|undefined>(cb, x as string|undefined)
//	                                          -> a.reduce<string|undefined>(cb, x)
//	                                             the type argument is already there, so only the
//	                                             assertion is stripped
//	(a.reduce)(cb, [] as number[])            -> (a.reduce<number[]>)(cb, [])
//	                                             the insert anchors on the member access, so it
//	                                             lands INSIDE the parentheses. That is upstream's
//	                                             output byte for byte, not an artifact of this port.
//
// The asserted type's text is copied from the source rather than re-rendered through the checker.
// `typeToString` would normalize a union's spacing and expand an alias, so a fixer built on it
// would rewrite type text the author chose. Upstream copies the source text and so does this.
//
// # Two divergences from the installed build, both measured, both stated
//
// A computed member key folded through a variable is a FALSE NEGATIVE here:
//
//	const key = 'reduce'; a[key](cb, [] as number[])   REPORTS upstream, SILENT here
//
// Upstream resolves it with ESLint's `getStaticValue` over the enclosing scope, which is the
// constant-folding layer this tree does not have. A plain `.reduce` and a string-literal computed
// key `['reduce']` are both handled, and the corpus exercises the literal form in both lists. The
// gap is one shape wide and it costs findings rather than inventing them.
//
// `[] as const` is a defect upstream ships and this port does NOT reproduce:
//
//	a.reduce(cb, [] as const)   REPORTS upstream, writing `a.reduce<const>(cb, [])`
//
// `const` is not a type, so upstream's own fix produces source that does not parse. The brief's
// standing instruction is that a port is not obliged to carry a defect it can see, and a fix
// applied unattended that breaks the file is the worst version of that. A const assertion is
// declined here, at the site below. The corpus writes no `as const` anywhere, so nothing imported
// can see either behavior.
//
// # Cost
//
// The anchor is a call expression, which is common, so the body exits on the argument count and the
// member name before touching the checker. The two type queries run only for a call to something
// named `reduce` whose second argument is a type assertion.
