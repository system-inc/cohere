// # Why this is a correctness rule and not a style rule
//
// `return promise` inside a `try` hands the promise to the CALLER before it settles, so a rejection
// arrives after this function's frame is gone and the local `catch` never runs. `return await
// promise` keeps the frame alive until it settles, so the local `catch` sees the rejection. The two
// spellings differ in which handler runs, which is why the rule's default forbids the await in
// ordinary positions and requires it inside error handling.
//
// Everything below exists to answer two questions: is the returned expression thenable, and does
// this position affect error handling.
//
// # The thenable question goes to the checker, not to the syntax
//
// `NeedsToBeAwaited` gives three answers rather than two, and the middle one is load bearing:
// `Always` for a real thenable, `Never` for something that cannot be, and `May` for `any`,
// `unknown`, and an unconstrained type parameter. An awaited `May` is left alone entirely, because
// reporting it would tell someone to remove an await from a value that might well be a promise.
// Only a `Never` produces `nonPromiseAwait`.
//
// # The error-handling question is a tree walk, and it is recursive
//
// A return inside a `try` block always affects error handling, because a try is always followed by
// a catch or a finally. A return inside a `catch` affects it when the same statement has a
// `finally`, and otherwise the question repeats one level out. A return inside a `finally` always
// repeats one level out. That recursion is upstream's and is reproduced: a return in a catch with
// no finally, nested inside an outer try, is still an error-handling context by virtue of the outer
// one.
//
// Measured rather than assumed, because this is the half ports get wrong: our `TryStatement`
// exposes `TryBlock`, `CatchClause` and `FinallyBlock`, and comparing the walked child against each
// by identity reproduces upstream's three-way answer, including a return nested inside an `if`
// inside a `try`. A port that silently answers "not in a try" removes an await it must not remove,
// which is a behaviour change rather than a formatting one.
//
// # `using` declarations are the second error-handling context, and the trivia trap is here
//
// A `using` or `await using` declaration in scope means the disposal runs when the scope exits, so
// whether the promise settles inside that scope changes observable behaviour. Upstream asks ESLint's
// scope analysis; this port walks enclosing blocks up to the function boundary, which reaches the
// same answer because a `using` is a block-scoped declaration.
//
// The position test is the part worth reading twice. Upstream requires the declaration to end
// BEFORE the return begins, and `node.Pos()` in our tree includes leading trivia, so it starts
// where the previous statement ended. Comparing against it makes a `using` on the line directly
// above the return read as "not before", which is the single most common shape this feature has.
// Probed: three of the corpus's `using` cases answered wrongly until the comparison moved to
// `rule.TokenRange`, and the two negative controls (a `using` after the return, and one outside an
// inner function) answered correctly both ways, so the mistake was invisible from the negatives.
//
// # A fix or a suggestion, decided by whether the edit can change behaviour
//
// When the position does NOT affect error handling, adding or removing the await cannot change
// which handler runs, so upstream ships a fix and the engine applies it unattended. When it DOES
// affect error handling, the same edit is a judgment about control flow and upstream ships a
// suggestion instead. Collapsing the two would have the edit engine silently rewriting which frame
// catches a rejection. `nonPromiseAwait` is always a fix, because removing an await from a
// non-thenable cannot change control flow at all.
//
// # This port follows the CLONE's fixer, not the installed build's, and that is deliberate
//
// The clone is 8.68.0 and the installed build our differential compares against is 8.67.0. 8.68
// added a guard to the await removal: when the operand starts with `{` and the await is the whole
// body of an arrow function, the operand is wrapped in parentheses. Without it:
//
//	const test = async () => await { a: 1 };   ->   const test = async () => { a: 1 };
//
// Measured on the installed 8.67 build, which produces exactly that, and confirmed against the
// compiler: the rewritten body parses as a Block containing a labelled statement rather than as an
// object literal, so the function silently stops returning anything. The brief's standing rule is
// that the installed build is the oracle because the differential compares against it. That reason
// does not hold when the difference is a bug fix rather than a disagreement, since reproducing it
// would mean shipping a repair that corrupts source. The guard is ported and four of upstream's own
// cases record the corrected output.
//
// # Cost
//
// The anchor is a return statement plus the concise body of an async arrow, and the body exits
// before touching the checker unless the enclosing function is async and there is an argument.
