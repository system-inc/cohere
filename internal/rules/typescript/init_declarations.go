// This is not upstream's stated default and the difference is measured rather than chosen. Upstream
// writes `defaultOptions: ['always']`, but it writes it as a createRule property rather than as
// `meta.defaultOptions`, and ESLint 10 applies only the latter. So a rule configured as a bare
// severity string is handed no options at all: the wrapper's `mode === 'always'` guard is skipped and
// the core rule's own mode matches neither branch, and the rule reports nothing.
//
// Measured on the installed 8.x build across three spellings of the same input, `var foo; var bar = 1;`:
//
//	"error"                 no findings
//	["error", "always"]     reports foo
//	["error", "never"]      reports bar
//
// So an unconfigured mode is a third state rather than a synonym for always, and it is reproduced as
// one. Defaulting to always instead would have been a defensible reading of the source and would have
// put 512 findings on this tree that the gate being replaced does not report. That number is how the
// difference was found: the audit predicted zero, this port produced 512, and the audit was right.

// # The wire shape here is ONE element, not upstream's array, and that cost a cycle

// Upstream's `meta.schema` is a positional tuple: the mode is `options[0]` and an object holding
// `ignoreForLoopInit` is `options[1]`, so the ESLint spelling is
// `["error", "never", {"ignoreForLoopInit": true}]`.
//
// cohere's config layer does not pass that through. `parseRuleSetting` reads a rule value as either a
// bare severity or a `[severity, options]` PAIR, and stores `tuple[1]` and nothing after it, so a
// decoder here is handed exactly one JSON value. For this rule that value is the bare string
// `"never"`. A decoder written to upstream's shape fails at run time with an unmarshal error naming a
// string where an array was wanted, which is how this was found: the fixtures all passed, because they
// were written to the same wrong belief, and only a seeded probe tree disagreed.

// The two modes are opposite house styles rather than a correctness judgment, which is why the same
// source appears in both halves of upstream's corpus. Under `always` a declaration without a value is
// a variable whose type the reader has to infer from a later assignment; under `never` an initializer
// on a `var` is a value that will be reassigned before it is read.
//
// # An unconfigured rule does NOTHING, and that is upstream's behavior rather than a decision here
//
// Upstream declares `defaultOptions: ['always']` and it never takes effect, because it is written as a
// createRule property rather than as `meta.defaultOptions` and ESLint 10 reads only the latter. A rule
// named as a bare severity string is therefore handed no mode, and reports nothing at all. Measured on
// the installed build rather than inferred, and the full reasoning is on
// DefaultInitDeclarationsSettings.
//
// This matters more than a usual divergence because the natural port is the wrong one. Reading
// `defaultOptions: ['always']` and defaulting to always is the obvious choice, it passes every one of
// upstream's seventy-seven cases since each names its mode, and it puts 512 findings on this tree that
// the gate being replaced does not report. The audit predicted zero, the first version of this port
// produced 512, and the audit was right.
//
// # The span differs by MODE, and reproducing that is most of this port
//
// This is an extension rule: upstream wraps ESLint's core rule and its only live contribution is
// narrowing where the finding points. Under `always` the report covers the identifier alone, so
// `let arr: string;` underlines three characters and leaves the annotation out; under `never` the
// core rule's own span is kept and covers the whole declarator, annotation and initializer included.
//
//	always:  let arr: string;              reports `arr`
//	never:   let arr: string = ['a'];      reports `arr: string = ['a']`
//
// Both are in the imported corpus and no message id assertion can tell them apart, so both are
// asserted as text. The narrowing exists because an uninitialized declaration's whole point is that
// there is nothing after the name worth underlining.
//
// # Where our tree answers directly what upstream has to walk for
//
// Upstream's wrapper walks every ancestor looking for a `declare`d namespace, and the core rule it
// wraps keeps a boolean it sets and clears on entering and leaving one. Both exist because an ESTree
// carries `declare` only on the node that was written with the keyword.
//
// Our parser propagates it. A declaration inside `declare namespace n {}` carries NodeFlagsAmbient
// itself, and so does one nested three namespaces deep, one inside `declare module`, one inside
// `declare global`, and one written `declare var` inside a plain namespace. Measured over six shapes
// rather than assumed. So the ancestor walk and the enter/exit bookkeeping are both replaced by a
// flag test on the declaration list, which is the same DECISION reached without reproducing a
// workaround for a constraint we do not have.
//
// # `never` exempts a constant binding, and there are three of them
//
// The core rule keeps a set of `const`, `using` and `await using`, because a binding in any of those
// forms must be initialized and cannot be reported for being so. Our parser puts all three on the
// same flag field as `let`, so the test is a flag test rather than a string comparison, and
// `await using` is the using flag with another bit set.
//
// # A for loop supplies the value, so the loop head is not a declaration without one
//
// `for (var foo in [])` and `for (var foo of [])` bind `foo` on each pass, and `for (var i = 0;;)`
// carries its initializer in the head. Upstream expresses this as "if the enclosing block is a loop,
// ask whether this declaration is the loop's own binding position rather than whether it has an
// initializer". Reproduced exactly, including that a declaration in a loop's BODY is not in that
// position: `for (var a in []) var foo;` reports, because `var foo` is the loop's statement rather
// than its binding.
//
// # Cost
//
// One listener on the declaration list, no checker, no program, no per-file state.
