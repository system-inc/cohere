// concurrent port has to edit, so two ports landing at once conflict on a file neither is really
// changing. rule.Register appends into a map keyed by name and is callable from any init, so a
// package may hold as many of these as it has rules, and a port becomes three new files and no
// shared edit.
//
// The bare name, not the namespaced one. The parity guard at internal/registry/parity_test.go
// catches `typescript/related-getter-setter-pairs` with a message saying so.
