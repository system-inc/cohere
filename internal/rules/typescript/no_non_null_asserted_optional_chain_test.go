// What the suggestion removes, which the fixture pair above cannot see.
//
// This rule offers a suggestion that deletes a range, and nothing asserted which range. A suggestion
// removing the wrong span is a rewrite the reader was never shown, and from a fixture that only
// checks which message fired it reads identically to a correct one.
//
// The range is one character wide, the `!` itself, so an off-by-one takes the token before it and
// leaves source that no longer parses. Asserted by applying the removal and comparing the resulting
// text rather than by comparing offsets, since an offset expectation is most likely to be wrong in
// the same direction as the code that produced it.
//
// Found by a review sweep rather than by a mutation, and that is worth recording. Every mutant I
// could construct against the range helper failed to compile, and a mutant that does not compile is
// neither a catch nor a survival, so this gap stood unmeasured rather than cleared until somebody
// read the test file and saw only ExpectFindings and ExpectClean in it.
