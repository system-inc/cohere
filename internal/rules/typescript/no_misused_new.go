// Ported from oxc's `typescript/no-misused-new`, which is itself a port of
// `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-new`. No option surface: the oxc rule file carries no
// `from_configuration` and no schema, and none of its nineteen corpus cases supplies a second
// tuple element.
//
// # Three judgments, not one
//
// The name suggests a single question and the rule asks three, each anchored on a different node
// and each with its own message. They are worth naming separately because two of them reach type
// literals and one does not, which is the single most counterintuitive thing here.
//
//	a construct signature whose return type names the interface declaring it
//	    anchored on the INTERFACE, so a type literal is never visited
//	a method signature named `constructor`
//	    anchored on the SIGNATURE, so a type literal IS visited
//	a bodyless class method named `new` whose return type names the class
//	    anchored on the CLASS, and only a named one
//
// The corpus pins the asymmetry directly and it reads as a contradiction until the anchors are
// laid out: `type T = { new (): T };` is a PASS while `type T = { constructor(): void;};` is a
// FAIL. Both are members of a type literal. The first is unreachable because the construct-
// signature arm only ever walks an interface's own body, and the second is reachable because the
// `constructor` arm listens for the signature wherever it lives. Reproducing this faithfully means
// resisting the urge to make the two arms symmetric.
//
// # The return type is compared by NAME TEXT, never by resolution
//
// oxc reads the written identifier out of the type annotation and compares its text to the
// declaration's own name. There is no symbol lookup anywhere in the rule, so this needs no type
// checker, and more importantly a port that reached for one would diverge on inputs the corpus
// never writes.
//
// Measured against the oxc release binary, both directions:
//
//	declare class C { new(): D; }  +  type D = C;   SILENT   (resolves to C, text is D)
//	interface Outer {}
//	namespace M { interface Outer { new (): Outer; } }      REPORTS (text matches, symbol does not)
//
// The first is the one that matters: `D` resolves to the enclosing class and a resolving port
// reports it. Both are pinned as fixtures.
//
// Type arguments are read past for the same reason. `declare class C { new(): C<T>; }` reports,
// because only the bare identifier `C` is compared and the arguments are never examined. A
// qualified name is a different node shape rather than an identifier, so `interface I { new (): I.K; }`
// declines, as does a parenthesized `(C)`.
//
// # A getter is a MethodDefinition upstream and its own kind here
//
// oxc's class arm iterates `ClassElement::MethodDefinition`, and in its abstract syntax tree a
// getter is a MethodDefinition carrying `kind: Get`. Our parser gives a getter `KindGetAccessor`,
// distinct from `KindMethodDeclaration`. So a port that listened only for method declarations
// would go silent on a getter named `new`, and no corpus case could see it: the corpus's only
// getter is `get new()` with no return type, which passes under either reading.
//
// Measured: `declare abstract class C { get new(): C; }` REPORTS. The getter is handled.
//
// A setter is also a MethodDefinition upstream and is handled here too, but it can never match,
// because a setter has no return type annotation to compare. That is upstream's behavior rather
// than an omission, and the fixture records it.
//
// # The `constructor` key must be a static identifier
//
// oxc destructures `PropertyKey::StaticIdentifier`, which is the identifier form alone. A string
// literal key and a computed key both carry the text `constructor` and both decline upstream,
// measured on the release binary.
//
// This is the one place `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName` is the wrong tool despite being the shelf's
// recommended answer for reading a property key. Probed on our own parse, it answers
// `("constructor", true)` for the identifier key, the string literal key, AND the computed key, so
// building on it over-reports on two inputs the corpus does not write. The kind is checked
// directly instead.
//
// # Where the findings point
//
// Neither arm reports the node its listener receives, so the spans are load-bearing and are pinned
// by their own test.
//
//	construct signature   the `new` keyword: three bytes from the signature's first token
//	method signature      the whole `constructor` key
//	class method          the whole `new` key
//
// oxc writes the first as `Span::sized(sig.span.start, 3)`, taking on faith that a construct
// signature begins with `new`. It does: the parser only produces one when it sees that keyword.

// classMemberParts pulls the key, the return type annotation, and whether a body is present out of

//
// Upstream's abstract syntax tree folds a method, a getter, and a setter into one MethodDefinition
// carrying a `kind` discriminant, and its match names the whole node rather than the discriminant,
// so all three are visited there. Only two are named here, and the missing one is a real decision
// rather than an oversight.
//
// # Why a setter is deliberately absent, and how that was established
//
// A setter cannot legally carry a return type annotation, so the obvious reading is that a setter
// arm would be inert and including it would cost nothing. That reading is wrong in our tree.
// Probed on our own parse, `declare class C { set new(v: C): C; }` produces a SetAccessor whose
// `Type` is a live KindTypeReference: the annotation is illegal, so it is a parse error, and
// typescript-go recovers by attaching the node anyway. Every other condition of the class arm is
// satisfied by that input, so a setter arm reports it.
//
// Upstream does not. oxc's parser refuses to attach a return type to a setter at all, so its
// `method.value.return_type` is None and `get_return_type_identifier` yields nothing. The rule
// never gets the chance to compare.
//
// This was measured rather than reasoned, because the release binary cannot answer it: the input
// raises TS1095 from the type-error channel, which suppresses rule output on that file, so a probe
// there returns a silence that means nothing. The case was added to oxc's own pass vector and
// `cargo test -p oxc_linter --lib no_misused_new` run: the only diagnostic emitted was TS1095 from
// the parser and `no-misused-new` reported nothing. oxc's tree was restored and verified clean
// afterwards.
//
// So the setter arm is omitted to reproduce upstream's silence. It was present in the first draft
// of this rule and it did report that input, which is a divergence no corpus case could have shown:
// upstream writes no setter with a return type, because upstream's parser cannot represent one.
