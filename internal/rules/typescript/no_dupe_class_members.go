// NoDupeClassMembers is typescript-eslint's extension of the core rule of the same name.
//
//	valid:   class A { ['foo']() {} ['foo']() {} }     computed, so never a duplicate here
//	valid:   class A { foo(a: string): void; foo(a: number): void; foo(a: unknown): void {} }
//	invalid: class A { foo() {} foo() {} }
//	invalid: class A { foo: string; foo: string; }
//
// Upstream's wrapper is `baseRule.create(context)` with two filters laid over the member listener:
// a member whose key is COMPUTED is skipped, and one whose value is a bodiless function expression
// is skipped. Everything that reports comes from the core rule underneath, which is ported here as
// `core.NoDupeClassMembers`, so this file carries the difference and nothing else.
//
// # Only ONE of upstream's two filters actually narrows anything, and it is not the obvious one
//
// The bodiless-function filter exists so a TypeScript overload signature is not read as a duplicate
// of its implementation. Our core already declines those, and not by inheritance: a previous porter
// found four false positives on real source, added `isOverloadSignature`, and wrote the measurement
// at the line. Measured again here across four shapes, an overload pair, a `declare class`, an
// `abstract class`, and an overload set followed by two real implementations: the wrapper and the
// bare core agree on all four, because ESLint's own rule reads the value's type and declines a
// bodiless one itself once the TypeScript parser hands it one.
//
// The computed filter is the one that bites, and it bites in the direction that reads backwards.
// `[x]()` twice is silent in both, since neither can know what `x` is. But `['foo']()` twice is a
// resolvable key, and the CORE reports it while the WRAPPER does not:
//
//	['foo']() twice     core reports, wrapper silent
//	['foo']() and foo() core reports, wrapper silent
//	[1]() twice         core reports, wrapper silent
//
// All three measured on the installed 8.67.0 build, driving the wrapper and the core over identical
// inputs. Upstream's corpus for this rule writes no literal computed key anywhere, so nothing in it
// can see this, and running that corpus through both rules produces byte-identical output on all
// twenty-one cases. The filter is `if (node.computed) return;` with no condition on what the key
// resolves to, which is a deliberate line rather than a side effect.
//
// So this rule is the core rule minus every computed key. Whether that is the better judgment is not
// this file's question: our core matches ESLint's core exactly on all six probed shapes, and this
// one matches typescript-eslint's wrapper.
//
// # Cost
//
// One extra kind test per class member over the core rule, and only on members the core would
// otherwise key.
