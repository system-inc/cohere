// NoThisAliasOptions configures which aliases of `this` report.
//
// The authoritative surface is oxc's `NoThisAliasConfig`, which derives `JsonSchema` under
// `serde(rename_all = "camelCase", deny_unknown_fields)` and carries exactly two fields. Measured
// against the release binary rather than read off an inventory column: a config naming a third key
// is refused outright with `unknown field, expected one of allowDestructuring, allowNames,
// allowedNames`, which is also how the third accepted spelling was confirmed to be an alias of the
// second rather than a field of its own.
type NoThisAliasOptions struct {
	// ReportDestructuring is upstream's `allowDestructuring` inverted, so that the Go zero value is
	// upstream's default.
	//
	// This inversion is the single most dangerous line in the port and it is deliberate. Upstream's
	// default is `allowDestructuring: true`, written as a hand-rolled `Default` impl rather than
	// derived, precisely because `false` is not what the rule wants when nobody configured it. A Go
	// field spelled `AllowDestructuring` would default to `false`, and every caller who configured
	// nothing would get the strict behavior: `const { props } = this` reporting in a tree where
	// upstream is silent. The name is flipped so that `NoThisAliasOptions{}` behaves the way the
	// rule is documented to behave. `decodeThisAliasOptions` is what maps the upstream spelling
	// onto it, and the zero-value fixture is what pins it.
	ReportDestructuring bool

	// AllowedNames are variable names permitted to hold `this`.
	//
	// Upstream accepts two spellings for this one field, `allowedNames` and `allowNames`, the
	// second being a typo oxc shipped and then kept as a serde alias for compatibility. They are
	// not two options: supplying both at once is a hard configuration error on the release binary,
	// not a merge, which is what settles that they name one field.
	//
	// The exemption reaches identifier aliases only. Measured with `d` in the allow list and
	// `allowDestructuring` off, `const { d } = this` still reports, because the destructure arm
	// never consults the list at all. That is upstream's structure rather than an oversight worth
	// improving on, and the fixture for it is in the silent-versus-reporting pair below.

// noThisAliasRawOptions is the wire shape, which differs from the shape the rule reasons with.

// It exists only so the JSON keys can stay upstream's while the struct the rule reads has the

// one point where "the config said nothing" and "the config said false" are still distinguishable.

//
// # Two messages, and which one an input gets is decided by the target's shape alone
//
// The rule produces two distinct findings and they are not severities of one another. An
// identifier target aliases the receiver itself and always reports; a destructuring target copies
// members off the receiver and reports only when the option asks for it. Because they are separate
// judgments, the allow list applies to the first and not to the second, and an input can be silent
// under one and reporting under the other with nothing else changed.
//
// # Parentheses fall opposite ways on the two sides of the same assignment
//
// This is the part a reading of the upstream source does not settle, and it was measured on the
// release binary rather than reasoned about.
//
// On the right, upstream's `rhs_is_this_reference` destructures `Expression::ThisExpression`
// directly with no unwrapping, so `const self = (this)` is silent, and so are `this as any` and
// `this!`. Our parser materializes a ParenthesizedExpression here exactly as it does everywhere
// else, so reproducing that silence costs nothing: the initializer's kind is simply not
// `KindThisKeyword` and the arm declines. The trap is the other direction, because skipping parens
// on an initializer reads as a free correctness improvement and would report three inputs upstream
// leaves alone.
//
// On the left, upstream reaches the identifier through `get_expression()` and then
// `get_identifier_reference()`, both of which unwrap. Measured: `(g) = this` reports, `((q)) = this`
// reports, `(h as any) = this` reports, `(r satisfies any) = this` reports, `(<any>r) = this`
// reports, and `(t!) = this` reports. In every case the finding points at the bare identifier and
// the span excludes the parentheses. So this side needs a recursive unwrap that the other side must
// not have, in one rule.
//
// # The assignment arm ignores the operator, and `+=` is the proof
//
// Upstream matches `AssignmentExpression` and never looks at which operator it carries. Measured:
// `d ??= this`, `e ||= this` and `g += this` all report. The last one is not aliasing under any
// reading of the rule's intent, since `+=` on a receiver produces a string, but it is what upstream
// decides and a port that filtered on `KindEqualsToken` would be silently narrower than the tool
// the gate runs. Reproduced deliberately, with a fixture, so the next reader finds the measurement
// rather than the intuition.
//
// # A member target is silent, and that is a real decision rather than a gap
//
// `this.self = this` and `m.n.o = this` are both silent upstream, because the simple-target arm
// asks for an identifier reference and a member expression yields none. That matters more than it
// looks: `this.self = this` is the single most common hand-written form of this exact defect, and
// upstream declines it. Measured on the release binary in both shapes.
