// NoConfusingNonNullAssertion flags a non-null assertion sitting immediately to the left of an
// operator whose spelling it can be mistaken for, or whose precedence it appears to change.
//
//	valid:   a == b!
//	valid:   a != b
//	valid:   (a + b!) == c
//	invalid: a! == b       reads as `a !== b`
//	invalid: a! = b        reads as `a != b`
//	invalid: a! in b       reads as `!(a in b)`
//
// Every case here is about how the source LOOKS rather than what it does. `a! == b` and `a !== b`
// differ by one space and mean opposite things, and `a! in b` reads to most people as a negation of
// the whole test when the `!` binds only to `a`. The code is correct as written; the next reader is
// the problem.
//
// Five operators, taken from upstream's set verbatim: `=`, `==`, `===`, `in`, `instanceof`. `!=` and
// `!==` are deliberately absent, which matters more than it looks: `a! != b` is SILENT upstream,
// measured, even though it is the shape a naive reading of "confusing bang" would flag first. There
// is nothing to confuse it with, because the assertion and the operator are already spelled apart.
//
// # Three messages, and the operator is interpolated into one of them
//
// `=` reports confusingAssign, `==` and `===` report confusingEqual, and `in` and `instanceof`
// report confusingOperator, whose text names the operator twice. That interpolation is the only
// per-finding text this rule produces, and it is asserted by equality in the fixtures rather than by
// a substring test, because a substring test cannot see a wrong operator spliced into the slot.
//
// # Suggestions, never fixes, which is upstream's decision and worth keeping
//
// Every repair here changes what the code MEANS. Removing the `!` drops an assertion the author
// wrote deliberately, and wrapping the left operand in parentheses changes precedence. Upstream
// declares `hasSuggestions` and no `fixable` for exactly that reason, so nothing is applied
// unattended, and this port carries the same distinction. A non-null assertion on the left offers
// removal; anything else offers only the wrap, because there is no `!` node to remove.
//
// `in` and `instanceof` offer BOTH suggestions, in upstream's order: remove first, wrap second.
//
// # How the token tests become a text test, and why that is not a shortcut
//
// Upstream works at the token level. It asks whether the last token of the left operand is a `!`
// punctuator, and separately whether the token after the left operand is a `)`. Neither question has
// a direct answer in our tree, and the structural equivalent turns out to be one test rather than
// two: whether the left operand's TRIMMED text ends in `!`.
//
// That reproduces both halves at once, which is the part worth recording:
//
// \ta! == b         left text "a!"        ends in bang   reports, as upstream
// \ta + b! == c     left text "a + b!"    ends in bang   reports, as upstream. The left is a
// \t                                                     binary expression rather than an
// \t                                                     assertion, which is why upstream looks at
// \t                                                     the token rather than the node kind, and
// \t                                                     why the text test has to as well.
// \t(a + b!) == c   left text "(a + b!)"  ends in paren  SILENT, and this is upstream's
// \t                                                     `tokenAfterLeft !== ')'` test arriving as
// \t                                                     a consequence rather than as a second
// \t                                                     check. Our parser keeps the parenthesized
// \t                                                     node, so its text carries the closing
// \t                                                     paren and the same test declines it.
// \ta !in b         left text "a !"       ends in bang   reports, as upstream. Whitespace inside
// \t                                                     the operand is irrelevant to both.
//
// The obvious worry is a `!` that is the last CHARACTER without being the last TOKEN. Probed, and
// the tree does not produce one: a bang inside a string, a template, or a computed key leaves the
// closing quote or bracket as the final character, so `'a!' == b`, "`a!` == b" and "x[`!`] == b" all
// end in something else and are silent here exactly as they are upstream. A trailing comment is
// excluded because the range is the TRIMMED token range rather than `Pos()` to `End()`.
//
// `a!!== b` is the one shape where the two tests could disagree and they do not: it parses as `a!`
// with the operator `!==`, so the text ends in a bang and the operator is not in the set. Silent
// both here and upstream, measured, and decided by the operator test rather than the text one.
//
// # One listener where upstream has two selectors
//
// Upstream matches `BinaryExpression, AssignmentExpression` because estree splits them. Our parser
// gives `a! = b` a KindBinaryExpression whose operator is KindEqualsToken, so a single listener
// covers both and the `=` arm is reachable from it. Probed rather than assumed.
