// Ported from oxc's `no_require_imports`, which is what the gate runs. `@typescript-eslint` ships
// the same rule and the two disagree in one visible way, recorded at the report site below.
//
// # Two arms, one rule, and they cannot both fire on one node
//
// A bare call and `import name = require('path')` are the same finding upstream and share a message,
// but they are different nodes and the split is not cosmetic. In an import-equals the `require`
// token is not an identifier at all: the parser folds the whole `require('path')` into a single
// `KindExternalModuleReference` whose only child is the path expression. Probed on our own parser,
// an identifier listener over `import lib8 = require('lib8')` sees no `require` at all. So the two
// arms partition the inputs rather than overlapping, and no input can report twice from one node.
//
// The same probe settled the other half: `import lib9 = lib2.anotherSubImport` produces no
// `KindExternalModuleReference` node whatsoever, so the qualified-name form upstream explicitly
// ignores is declined by the listener kind rather than by a test inside it.
//
// # Why this reads the checker, and why resolvesToAGlobal is the wrong helper
//
// The rule must separate the CommonJS `require` from a local binding somebody named `require`.
// Upstream asks `is_global_reference_name`, which is name resolution rather than a scope flag, and
// there is no structural answer: the shadow can be a `const` from `createRequire()`, a `let` in an
// enclosing function, a parameter, or an import, at any depth.
//
// `resolvesToAGlobal` is the shipped helper for "global or a local shadowing it" and it is the
// wrong test here, in the direction that silences the rule rather than the one that over-reports.
// It answers **false** for a symbol the checker cannot resolve, and that is the common case for
// `require`: measured on our own harness, a bare `require('lib')` in a program without `@types/node`
// resolves to a **nil symbol**. Using that helper would have made the rule report nothing at all in
// exactly the trees it exists for, and every fixture would still have been green, because the
// fixture harness has no `@types/node` either and so agrees with the real tree only by accident.
//
// The predicate is therefore the inverse and it is written to answer the same way in both worlds.
// Measured four ways against the harness:
//
//	no @types/node, bare require        symbol is nil                         report
//	@types/node present, bare require   one KindFunctionDeclaration, in a .d.ts  report
//	shadowed by a local binding         one KindVariableDeclaration, in source   silent
//	class method named `require`        nil, or the .d.ts declaration            report
//
// The last row is upstream's own corpus and it is the one that shows the predicate is about scope
// bindings rather than about the spelling: a method named `require` is a member of the class, not a
// binding in the scope the call sits in, so the call still reaches the global and still reports.
// Upstream ships two such cases and both report.
//
// So a source declaration is the only thing that buys silence, and the loop is over every
// declaration rather than the first: a `require` symbol genuinely carries more than one declaration
// when two declaration files declare it, which was measured rather than assumed.
//
// # Parentheses, measured rather than guessed
//
// oxc reaches the callee through `get_identifier_reference()`, which skips parentheses. Our AST
// keeps the parenthesis as a real node, so reproducing upstream means **adding** a skip that is not
// in upstream's text. Pinned against the release binary: `(require)('lib')` reports with the span
// starting at column 1, `((require))('lib')` reports, and `(require('lib'))` reports with the span
// starting at column 2, which is the inner call rather than the wrapper. The corpus writes no
// parenthesized form, so guessing either way would have cost nothing at fixture time and shipped a
// divergence.
//
// # The `allow` option matches a template on RAW text and a string on COOKED text
//
// One option, two answers, split by literal kind, and this is invisible from the corpus because
// every corpus path is escape-free. oxc reads `quasi.value.raw` for a template and
// `string_literal.value` for a string. Our `.Text` is the cooked value for both, so the template
// arm has to slice the source instead. Pinned against the release binary with `allow: ["^abc$"]`:
//
//	require(`abc`)   raw is abc, no match, REPORTS
//	require("abc")   cooked is abc,   matches,  silent
//
// A port reading `.Text` for both would have gone silent on the first, and no imported fixture
// could have seen it.
//
// # Only a string literal participates in `allow` on the import-equals arm
//
// oxc's `ExternalModuleReference` arm reads `mod_ref.expression.value`, a field that exists only on
// a string literal, so a template there can never match an allow pattern. In oxc that arm is
// unreachable: `import a = require(`lib`)` is a parse error, confirmed by running the
// release binary, which reports `Unexpected token` and no rule diagnostic. Our parser recovers from
// it and hands the arm a `KindNoSubstitutionTemplateLiteral`, so the branch is reachable here and
// upstream has no answer to copy. Following upstream's code, a non-string expression simply does
// not match, and the declaration reports. Recorded because the intuitive reading is the opposite
// one, and the next reader would otherwise helpfully "fix" it.
//
// # No fix
//
// Upstream marks the fixer `pending` and ships none, and it should not. Rewriting `const x =
// require('y')` into an import moves a statement to the top of the file, changes when the module is
// evaluated, and has no correct answer when the call sits inside a function or a conditional. That
// is a change of meaning at a site the rule does not own, so it is not even a suggestion here.

// isLocallyBound reports whether an identifier spelled `require` resolves to a binding written in
// source rather than to the CommonJS global.
//
// The question is whether any declaration actually introduces a binding. A `let`, `const`, `var`,
// parameter or function somebody wrote does; an ambient declaration does not, whether it sits in a
// declaration file or inside a `declare global` block in source; and in a program with no
// `@types/node` the name resolves to nothing at all. An unresolved name is therefore treated as the
// global rather than as a local, which is the direction that keeps the rule working in a tree that
// does not carry those types.
//
// # Why the ambient flag is the whole test, and not "which file declares it"
//
// The first version of this asked `IsDeclarationFile` on the declaration's own source file, which
// is what `resolvesToAGlobal` does. That is wrong in one measurable place and a mutation sweep
// found it: `declare global { function require(...) }` puts a declaration in a SOURCE file without
// introducing a binding, and upstream reports the call beside it while staying silent beside a
// plain `function require(...)`. Both were pinned on the release binary.
//
// With the ambient test in place the file test became unreachable rather than merely redundant.
// Probed four ways, every declaration reachable inside a `.d.ts` carries the ambient flag, because
// TypeScript marks the whole declaration file ambient, so the `continue` above declines every input
// a file test could have seen. It was removed rather than left as dead reassurance.
//
// # Every declaration, not the first
//
// The symbol genuinely carries more than one, and the orderings run both ways. Two declaration
// files declaring `require` give two ambient declarations. An ambient overload written above a real
// implementation in one source file gives `[ambient, real]`, putting the only genuine binding at
// index 1, and upstream is silent on it. An index-zero read reports that input and is wrong; both
