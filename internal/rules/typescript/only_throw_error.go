// the two typed halves of that array, exactly as `no-floating-promises` splits its two allowlists.
//
// The three booleans stay POINTERS all the way through, because every one of them defaults to
// TRUE. Binding them to plain `bool` would make an unconfigured rule behave as though all three had
// been explicitly turned off, which is the loudest possible failure: `throw someAny` would start
// reporting on every file in the tree. Absent has to stay distinguishable from false.

// downstream then prints something that describes nothing. The rule is about what the catcher
// receives, not about style.
//
// # What decides a finding
//
// One listener on `KindThrowStatement`, reading the argument's TYPE. The order below is upstream's
// and it is load-bearing, because two arms can both match the same input and the first one wins:
//
//	rethrow          an identifier bound by a catch clause, or by the rejection handler of a
//	                 `.catch`/`.then` on something thenable. Silent, and checked FIRST, so a
//	                 rethrown string is allowed while a bare string is not.
//	allow            the configured specifiers, matched against the type
//	undefined        reported as `undef` rather than `object`, and reported BEFORE the any/unknown
//	                 escapes, so `throw undefined` reports even with everything else permitted
//	any              silent unless `allowThrowingAny` is false
//	unknown          silent unless `allowThrowingUnknown` is false
//	Error-like       silent
//	everything else  reported as `object`
//
// The `undefined` arm sitting above the `any` and `unknown` arms is the one piece of the ordering
// that is not obvious, and upstream's own corpus pins it: `throw undefined` is invalid case 0 with
// no options at all, so it reports while every default is still permissive.
//
// The type test is `TypeFlagsUndefined`, which is a FLAG test rather than an equality, so a union
// containing `undefined` takes this arm. Measured against the installed rule:
// `declare const x: Error | undefined; throw x;` reports `object`, not `undef`, because the union
// as a whole does not carry the undefined flag at the top level -- `Error | undefined` is a union
// type whose own flags are `Union`. A bare `undefined` does.
//
// # Parentheses, and the one place our parser differs from ESTree
//
// ESTree does not represent parentheses as nodes at all, so upstream's rule is handed a bare
// `Identifier` for `throw (e)` and its `node.type !== Identifier` guard never sees the wrapper.
// Our parser DOES produce `KindParenthesizedExpression`, so a literal port of that guard would
// decline every parenthesized rethrow and report it as a violation.
//
// This is a parser difference rather than a rule difference, so the port skips parentheses in the
// rethrow check to reproduce the DECISION. Measured on the installed rule, holding source fixed and
// varying only `allowRethrowing`:
//
//	try {} catch (e) { throw (e); }    allowRethrowing default   SILENT
//	try {} catch (e) { throw (e); }    allowRethrowing: false    REPORTS object
//
// The second row is what proves the rethrow arm is actually firing on the parenthesized form rather
// than the case being silent for some other reason. Both are fixtured.
//
// The SPAN excludes the parentheses too, and that is measured rather than inherited: upstream
// reports `throw ('error')` at columns 8..15, which is `'error'` without its wrapper, because
// ESTree hands it the inner node. `ctx.ReportNode` on the skipped node reproduces it.
//
// # The rethrow arm, and what replaces the scope manager
//
// Upstream reaches for `context.sourceCode.getScope(node)` and `findVariable`, then reads the
// resolved variable's `defs`. We have no scope manager, and we do not need one: the checker answers
// the same question. `GetSymbolAtLocation` on the identifier returns the symbol, and its
// declarations carry the shape upstream reads off the definition. Probed on this tree:
//
//	try {} catch (e) { throw e; }            decl KindVariableDeclaration, parent KindCatchClause
//	p.catch(e => { throw e; })               decl KindParameter,           parent KindArrowFunction
//	let x = 1; p.catch(e => { throw x; })    decl KindVariableDeclaration, parent KindVariableDeclarationList
//
// So the catch arm is "one declaration, and its parent is a catch clause", and the promise arm is
// "one declaration, it is the FIRST parameter of an arrow function, and that arrow is the rejection
// handler of a `.catch`/`.then` on a thenable".
//
// Upstream filters `defs` to those where `isVariableDefinition` is true and requires exactly one.
// In its scope manager that flag is false for exactly one definition kind, `TypeDefinition`, so the
// filter means "exactly one non-type definition". A symbol's `Declarations` here is the merged
// list, and the equivalent narrowing is to require a single declaration: a name that is both a type
// and a value has two, and upstream declines it.
//
// # What the promise arm requires, all four conditions measured
//
// Every one of these was measured against the installed rule rather than read off the source,
// because the source states them as a conjunction and reading a conjunction tells you nothing about
// which conjunct is doing the work:
//
//	the handler must be an ARROW function      `.catch(function (e) { throw e; })`  REPORTS
//	the binding must be the FIRST parameter    `.catch((a, e) => { throw e; })`     REPORTS
//	it must be a plain identifier parameter    `.catch(({ e }) => { throw e; })`    REPORTS
//	the receiver must be THENABLE              a `{ catch(cb) {} }` object          REPORTS
//
// The rest parameter case is the same first-parameter rule seen from the other side:
// `.catch((...e) => { throw e; })` binds `e` to the whole argument list rather than to the
// rejection, so upstream reports it, and its corpus pins that as invalid case 40.
//
// The method NAME is read statically, and it resolves through a computed access and even through a
// const-folded variable key. Measured, with `allowRethrowing: false` as the control on each:
//
//	Promise.reject('x')['catch'](e => { throw e; })          SILENT (reports with rethrow off)
//	const k = 'catch'; Promise.reject('x')[k](e => ...)      SILENT (reports with rethrow off)
//	p?.catch(e => { throw e; })                              SILENT
//
// The const-folded key is the one this port does NOT reproduce, and it is stated rather than
// silent. Upstream's `getStaticMemberAccessValue` falls back to `getStaticValue`, an evaluator that
// resolves an identifier through the scope manager to a constant initializer. Reproducing it means
// a constant-folding pass, which is a substantially larger piece of machinery than the rest of this
// rule, and it costs exactly one thing: `obj[k](e => { throw e; })` where `k` is a `const` bound to
// `'catch'` or `'then'` reports here and is silent upstream. No case in the corpus writes that
// shape. The literal computed form `['catch']` IS reproduced, since that needs no evaluator.
//
// # Two arms of the `then` shape, and why the second argument matters
//
// `.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)` puts the rejection handler SECOND, so the arrow must be
// `arguments[1]`; `.then(onRejected)` has no rejection handler at all, and upstream reports it.
// That is invalid case 43 in the corpus. A spread anywhere before the handler makes the position
// unknowable, so upstream returns the object without an `onRejected` and the arm declines: invalid
// cases 41, 42 and 43 are exactly those three spread shapes.
//
// # `allow`, and the two specifier forms
//
// `allow` is checked against the type before any of the built-in escapes, so a configured specifier
// wins over the `undef` arm: upstream's valid case 32 allows `{from: 'lib', name: 'undefined'}` and
// `throw undefined` goes clean. Fixtured.
//
// # Cost
//
// `KindThrowStatement` is a rare anchor. The checker is consulted once per throw, and the rethrow
// arm short-circuits on anything that is not a bare identifier, so the thenable test runs only for
// a `throw e` inside a callback.
