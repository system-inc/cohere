// NonNullableTypeAssertionStyle flags a type assertion whose only effect is removing null and
// undefined, which a `!` says in one character.
//
//	valid:   declare const original: number | string; const cast = original as string;
//	valid:   declare const original: number | undefined; const cast = original as any;
//	valid:   type T = string | null; declare const x: T; const y = x as NonNullable<T>;
//	valid:   const foo = [] as const;
//	invalid: declare const maybe: string | undefined; const bar = maybe as string;
//	invalid: declare const maybe: string | null | undefined; const bar = maybe as string;
//
// An assertion that only strips nullish is `!` written the long way, and the long way is worse than
// verbose: `as string` keeps asserting `string` after somebody widens the variable to
// `string | number`, silently, while `!` narrows whatever is there and keeps failing loudly when the
// underlying type changes. So this is a rule about which assertion survives a refactor, not about
// character count.
//
// # The judgment is type IDENTITY, and identity is why the checker is required
//
// Upstream compares the asserted type's constituents against the original's with `includes`, which
// is reference equality on interned `ts.Type` objects rather than any structural comparison. That is
// reproduced exactly: our checker interns the same way, measured by printing pointers for the same
// `string` reached through an expression and through a type node and finding one address. A
// structural comparison would be a different rule, and a looser one.
//
// The report fires only when all three hold: the original has at least one nullish constituent, every
// asserted constituent is a non-nullish constituent of the original, and every non-nullish original
// constituent is asserted. That third clause is what keeps `number | null | undefined as number|null`
// silent, and the corpus tests it.
//
// # The fixture harness must be one file per program, and measuring this cost a cycle
//
// Two of upstream's own failing cases assert to a `type` alias and to an `interface`, and both depend
// on the asserted object type being the SAME interned object as the one in the original union. A
// replay harness that put all twenty cases in one program had several files each declaring
// `type Type`, the checker interned one per file, identity failed, and those two cases came back
// clean. It reads exactly like a rule that cannot see object types. Running each case in its own
// program reproduced all twenty. rule_testing.RunTyped builds a one-file program per call, so the
// fixtures below are naturally isolated, and this is recorded because the same instrument bug is
// available to anyone re-measuring this rule.
//
// # Parentheses, where our tree keeps a node upstream's parser drops
//
// Upstream decides whether its rewrite needs wrapping by asking whether the asserted expression binds
// tighter than a unary operator, and it takes the replacement text from that expression. Its parser
// folds parentheses away, so `(await p()) as string` reaches its rule as the await itself. Ours keeps
// KindParenthesizedExpression, so without an unwrap the rule would be reading a different node than
// upstream reads and asking the precedence question about the wrong thing.
//
// Reading our node directly happens to produce upstream's answer on most shapes, which is what makes
// this worth writing down: a parenthesized expression's precedence is above unary, so nothing more
// gets added and the parentheses already in the text survive into the output. That accident covers
// `(await p())`, `(c ? a : a)` and `(0, a)`, and it fails on exactly one shape, `(a) as string`, where
// upstream drops the redundant parentheses and writes `a!`. The unwrap in the body puts every shape on
// upstream's own footing rather than relying on the accident.
//
// Measured on the installed build across bare await, a parenthesized await, a parenthesized
// conditional, a comma expression, redundant parentheses around an identifier, an angle-bracket
// assertion and a plain call, with the precedence our own parser assigns each one printed beside it.
// Recorded at this length because "our AST keeps a node upstream's drops, and the fixer reads that
// node's text" is exactly the shape that ships a wrong repair while every message id assertion stays
// green.
//
// # `as const` is guarded separately because the types are equal
//
// A const assertion yields the same type object as the expression, so nothing downstream would report
// it and the guard reads as redundant. It is not: `getTypeAtLocation` on the `const` type node
// answers the expression's own type, so for `x as const` where x is `string | null` BOTH sides are
// that union, the original has nullish, and the asserted constituents are a subset. Without the guard
// the rule reports `const foo = [] as const;` and rewrites it to `[]!`, changing what the code means.
// Upstream guards on the syntax rather than the type for the same reason.
//
// # Cost
//
// Two rare anchors, and the checker is consulted only when one is found. Both type lookups are
// declined early when the expression is any or unknown, which is the common shape in the code this
// rule runs on.

// rule meets most often in real code, and because the subsumption is a fact about the current
