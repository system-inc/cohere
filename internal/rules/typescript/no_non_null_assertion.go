// NoNonNullAssertion flags every non-null assertion.
//
//	valid:   foo?.bar
//	valid:   let value!: number
//	valid:   const other: NonNullable<Thing> = thing
//	invalid: foo!
//	invalid: foo!.bar
//	invalid: foo!()
//
// Ported from `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`.
//
// # It reports unconditionally, and only the repair is conditional
//
// Every assertion is a finding. The parent shape decides only whether a suggestion can be attached,
// so a rule that looked at the parent to decide whether to report would be a different, quieter
// rule. The bare `foo!` gets a finding with no suggestion, which is correct: there is no `?.` that
// means the same thing when nothing follows the assertion.
//
// # A suggestion rather than a fix, and why the split is real here
//
// `foo!.bar` and `foo?.bar` do not mean the same thing. The first evaluates to `bar` or throws; the
// second evaluates to `bar` or `undefined`, which changes the expression's type and pushes a new
// `undefined` into everything downstream. That is a meaning change, so a human chooses it. The
// original marks the rule `hasSuggestions` and not `fixable` for the same reason.
//
// # Definite assignment is a different syntax and cannot reach this rule
//
// `let value!: number` also spells an exclamation mark, and it means the opposite thing: a promise
// to the compiler that the variable is assigned before use, checked rather than erased. In
// typescript-go it parses as an ExclamationToken on the declaration, never a NonNullExpression, so
// a listener keyed to this node kind cannot see it. Verified against the parser rather than assumed,
// and pinned by a clean fixture, because the two constructs are one keystroke apart in source.

// The recursion here walks up through parentheses and type assertions, and stops at a member access.

// valid. Matching the original is the right call regardless, because divergence here would be
