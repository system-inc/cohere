// concurrent port has to edit, so two ports landing at once conflict on a file neither is really
// changing.
//
// `Decode` names the rule's own hand-written decoder rather than `rule.DecodeOptionsInto`. Neither
// of this rule's two defaults is a Go zero value, and `readonly` falls back to the RESOLVED value of
// `default` rather than to a constant, which is a dependency between two fields no struct tag can
// express. A generic decode would hand the rule two empty settings that match no arm, and the rule
// would register on every file and report nothing while every fixture stayed green.
