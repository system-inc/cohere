// Ported from `@typescript-eslint/related-getter-setter-pairs`, which defines the rule. The clone at
// `packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/related-getter-setter-pairs.ts` and the installed 8.67.0 build in
// `node_modules` are byte-identical in behavior, and every claim below was measured by driving that
// installed build through the ESLint Linter API rather than read off the source.
//
// The corpus is `tests/rules/related-getter-setter-pairs.test.ts`: sixteen clean cases and seven
// reporting ones, each reporting case carrying an explicit line, column, endLine and endColumn. All
// twenty three were reproduced on the installed build before a line of this was written, which is
// what makes the invented probes below trustworthy.
//
// # The judgment
//
// Upstream keeps a stack of name-to-pair maps, pushed when a class body, an interface body or a type
// literal is entered and popped on exit. A getter is recorded only when it carries a return type
// annotation; a setter only when it declares exactly one parameter. On exit, for every name holding
// both, the getter's type must be assignable to the setter's parameter type or the getter's return
// type node is reported.
//
// Both filters are load-bearing and the corpus pins each of them: `get value() { return ”; }` with
// no annotation is clean beside a mismatching setter, and so are `set value()` and
// `set value(a: string, b: string)`. Neither is an optimization, since dropping either would report
// cases upstream leaves alone.
//
// This is written as a per-container listener rather than as a stack, because typescript-go hands us
// each container node and its members are reachable from it. That is the same decision expressed
// without the bookkeeping ESLint's one-node-at-a-time visitor forces, and it makes nesting fall out
// for free: an inner class inside an outer method gets its own pass and never sees the outer names.
// Measured against the installed build on a class holding a mismatching pair whose method body
// declares an inner class holding another, which reports twice, and on the same shape where only the
// inner mismatches, which reports once and points inside.
//
// # The container set, and the two shapes that are NOT in it
//
// `ClassBody`, `TSInterfaceBody` and `TSTypeLiteral` are the three, and both omissions were measured
// rather than assumed:
//
//	const o = { get value(): number { return 1; }, set value(v: string) {} };    clean
//	class C { get value(): number { return 1; } set value(v: string) {} }        reports
//
// An object literal's accessors are `Property` nodes under an `ObjectExpression`, which is in none of
// the three, so upstream never records them. In typescript-go they are the same `KindGetAccessor` and
// `KindSetAccessor` the class holds, distinguished only by their parent, so listening on the
// containers rather than on the accessors reproduces the gap by construction. A rule anchored on the
// accessor kind would have to grow a parent test to decline the object literal, and the natural way
// to write that rule would report it.
//
// A class expression's body is also a `ClassBody`, so `const C = class { ... }` reports. That is why
// the listener covers `KindClassExpression` beside `KindClassDeclaration`: the two are one node type
// in TSESTree and two here.
//
// # abstract accessors are silent, and this is a PARSER difference we have to reproduce by hand
//
// This is the single most surprising thing in the rule and no imported fixture can see it, because
// the corpus writes no `abstract` anywhere.
//
//	abstract class C { abstract get value(): number; abstract set value(v: string); }   clean
//	abstract class C { abstract get value(): number; set value(v: string) {} }          clean
//	abstract class C { get value(): number { return 1; } abstract set value(v: string); }  clean
//	declare class C { get value(): number; set value(v: string); }                     reports
//
// The mechanism is the selector. Upstream matches `:matches(MethodDefinition, TSMethodSignature)`,
// and typescript-eslint's parser gives an `abstract` accessor the node type
// `TSAbstractMethodDefinition`, which is neither. So an abstract accessor is never recorded on
// either side of the pair, and one abstract half silences the whole pair. A `declare class`
// accessor stays a plain `MethodDefinition` and reports, which is the control that proves the
// distinction is `abstract` rather than "has no body". Both verdicts were read off the parser
// directly as well as off the rule.
//
// typescript-go has no such node: an abstract accessor is a `KindGetAccessor` carrying an
// `abstract` modifier, so nothing about our tree reproduces the gap. It is reproduced explicitly
// below. That is fidelity to upstream's decision through a workaround we do not need, which is the
// case where fidelity wins: the gate compares against upstream, and reporting these would read as a
// defect.
//
// # Name keying, which is upstream's `getNameFromMember` and does NOT match the property shelf
//
// `internal/utilities/ecmascript/property.Name` is the obvious shelf function here and it is wrong for
// this rule in two directions, both measured. It DECLINES a bare identifier inside brackets, on the
// stated reasoning that `[a]` names whatever the variable holds; upstream keys that as the
// identifier's own name, so `get [k]()` and `set [k]()` DO pair and report. And it reads THROUGH the
// brackets for a literal, so `['lit']` and `'lit'` both answer `lit` while upstream keys the first
// as its inner literal's cooked value too. The first disagreement costs findings, the second does
// not, and only the first is visible from the corpus, which writes no computed key at all.
//
// So this reproduces `getNameFromMember` rather than reaching for the shelf. Read off the parser and
// the helper together on nine key spellings:
//
//	get plain()             plain          identifier, bare name
//	get #priv()             #priv          private identifier, hash included
//	get 'quoted'()          quoted         literal that IS a valid identifier, bare
//	get 'a-b'()             "a-b"          literal that is NOT, wrapped in double quotes
//	get 12()                "12"           numeric literal, cooked then wrapped
//	get 1e1()               "10"           cooked to the canonical rendering first
//	get [k]()               k              computed identifier, keyed by the identifier
//	get ['lit']()           lit            computed literal, keyed like a bare literal
//	get [Symbol.iterator]() Symbol.iterator  anything else, raw source text of the key
//
// The quoting is `requiresQuoting`, which is exactly "this string is not a valid identifier", so
// `scanner.IsIdentifierText` answers it inverted. `LanguageVariantStandard` rather than the JSX
// variant, because upstream calls `ts.isIdentifierPart` with no variant.
//
// The keying produces collisions that look like defects and are upstream's actual behavior, all
// measured on the installed build:
//
//	class C { get 'value'(): number {...} set value(v: string) {} }        reports
//	class C { get value(): number {...} set ["value"](v: string) {} }      reports
//	class C { get 12(): number {...} set '12'(v: string) {} }              reports
//	class C { static get value(): number {...} set value(v: string) {} }   reports
//
// The last is the one worth staring at. `static` is not part of the key at all, so a static getter
// pairs with an instance setter that can never be the same property. Reproduced rather than
// corrected.
//
// # Last write wins, which decides which of two duplicates is judged
//
// The map is written with `.set`, so a second getter under one name REPLACES the first and a second
// setter replaces the first. That is a behavioral decision hiding in a data-structure choice and it
// is invisible to any fixture asserting a count:
//
//	get value(): number; get value(): string; set value(v: string)   clean, second getter wins
//	get value(): string; get value(): number; set value(v: string)   reports, second getter wins
//	get value(): number; set value(v: number); set value(v: string)  reports, second setter wins
//	get value(): number; set value(v: string); set value(v: number)  clean, second setter wins
//
// All four measured. The natural Go spelling, writing into a map only when the key is absent, gets
// every one of them backwards.
//
// # The span, and the one place our tree differs
//
// The finding points at the getter's return type node, not at the annotation and not at the member.
// The corpus states this seven times with explicit columns, and the widest case spans
// `string | undefined` across eighteen columns while a multi-line object type spans three lines.
//
// A parenthesized return type is where the two trees part. TSESTree has no parenthesized-type node,
// so `get value(): (string)` reports on `string` with the parens excluded, measured. typescript-go
// keeps a `KindParenthesizedType` spanning `(string)`, so reporting `node.Type()` directly would
// point at a wider span than upstream on exactly that input. `ast.SkipTypeParentheses` unwraps it.
// The corpus writes no parenthesized type, so nothing imported can see this either way.
//
// # The checker
//
// Required. `isTypeAssignableTo` is not on the checker's exported surface, so it comes through the
// shim's linkname at `shim/checker/shim.go:136`, the same way `no_unsafe_unary_minus` and the
// builtins shelf reach their own upstream helpers. `GetTypeAtLocation` on the getter node answers
// the getter's return type and on a parameter node answers that parameter's type, which is what
// upstream asks for through its parser services. Probed rather than assumed, on an interface, a
// class and a type literal.
//
// The direction is getter-assignable-to-setter and it is not symmetric. `get value(): string` beside
// `set value(v: never)` reports while `get value(): never` beside `set value(v: string)` is clean,
// which is the pair that pins the direction, since `never` is assignable to everything and nothing
// but `never` is assignable to it. Both measured.
