// NoImpliedEval flags the `eval()`-like calls: a non-function handed to `setTimeout`,
// `setInterval`, `setImmediate` or `execScript`, and any use of the `Function` constructor.
//
//	valid:   setTimeout(() => {}, 0)
//	valid:   window.setTimeout(() => {}, 0)
//	valid:   foo.setTimeout(null)              // receiver is not a global candidate
//	valid:   function setTimeout() {}; setTimeout('x')   // declared in this file
//	invalid: setTimeout('x = 1', 0)
//	invalid: window['setInterval']('x = 1', 0)
//	invalid: new Function('a', 'return a')
//
// A string handler is compiled and evaluated at call time with the same power as `eval`, so it
// reads as a function call while actually being a code-injection surface: the argument may be
// built from user input, it runs in the global scope, and no linter or type checker can see
// inside it.
//
// # Absorbed from tsgolint, which is the source of record for this rule
//
// Provenance: tsgolint `internal/rules/no_implied_eval/no_implied_eval.go`, vendored at commit
// `05b7fbc` and absorbed onto verify's own rule interface here. It reaches for `IsSymbolFlagSet`,
// `IsBuiltinSymbolLike`, `GetCallSignatures` and `Some` because that is what upstream reaches for,
// and this note is why a reader finds those helpers in a file that otherwise looks native.
//
// tsgolint is not re-synced, so this file is now the only copy of the algorithm rather than a
// translation layer over a vendored one. The checker logic below is byte-identical to upstream's;
// what changed is the interface it speaks: `rule.RuleContext` became `rule.Context`,
// `RuleListeners` became `Listeners`, and `rule.RuleMessage` became `rule.Message`. No predicate,
// no flag set and no traversal was touched, and the verification that the body reproduces upstream
// stands: all seventy cases are replayed, forty eight clean and twenty two reporting seventy six
// findings.
//
// oxc declares this rule `(tsgolint)` and carries no algorithm and no corpus, so the behavior
// oxlint exhibits IS tsgolint's: the release binary shells out to a `tsgolint` executable and
// refuses to run the rule when that binary is absent, which is what it does on this machine.
// That refusal is itself the proof, so oxlint cannot serve as ground truth here and tsgolint's
// own test file is the corpus instead.
//
// # How the callee is recognized: NAME, with resolution used only to EXEMPT
//
// This is the load-bearing question for this rule and it is easy to get backwards, so it was
// measured rather than reasoned about.
//
// Recognition is purely SYNTACTIC. `getCalleeName` accepts a bare identifier's text, or a
// property/element access whose RECEIVER is literally one of `global`, `globalThis`, `window`.
// Nothing is resolved to decide that a call is eval-like. Consequences, all measured:
//
//   - `self.setTimeout('x')` is SILENT. `self` is a real global alias for `window` in the DOM and
//     it is simply not on upstream's three-name list.
//   - `window.a.setTimeout('x')` is SILENT: the receiver of the matched access must be the
//     identifier itself, so one more level of nesting declines.
//   - `window['setTimeout']('x')` REPORTS, but only for a STRING LITERAL key. A `const k =
//     'setTimeout'` variable key and a TEMPLATE-literal key are both silent, because the check is
//     `ast.IsStringLiteral` on the argument expression and neither is one.
//   - `const st = setTimeout; st('x', 0)` is SILENT. The alias carries the function's type, not
//     its name, and names are all this rule reads.
//
// Resolution enters exactly once, as a NEGATIVE filter after the name has already matched: the
// callee's symbol is resolved and the finding is WITHHELD when any of that symbol's declarations
// lives in the file being linted. So a local `function setTimeout() {}` exempts the whole file,
// and so does `import { setTimeout } from './timers'` — the import declaration is in this file.
//
// That filter is FILE-scoped rather than lexically scoped, which is the surprising part and is
// pinned by a fixture below: a `setTimeout` declared inside a nested block still exempts a call
// at the top level, because the question asked is "does this symbol have a declaration in this
// source file", not "does this binding shadow the call site".
//
// # What counts as "a string": NOTHING DOES. It is a not-a-function test.
//
// The rule's name and its corpus, which is almost entirely string literals, both invite the
// reading that this rule detects strings. It does not, and a port written to that belief would
// pass most of the imported corpus while being wrong. Measured against the vendored rule:
//
//	setTimeout(1, 0)          REPORTS      a number
//	setTimeout(null, 0)       REPORTS      null
//	setTimeout(u, 0)          REPORTS      a declared `unknown`
//	setTimeout(a, 0)          REPORTS      a declared `any`
//
// `isFunction` answers three ways and none of them mentions strings: a syntactic function-like
// node passes; a literal expression is rejected outright without consulting the checker; and
// everything else is asked of the type checker, which passes it when the symbol carries
// `Function`/`Method` flags, when the type is builtin-`Function`-like, or when it has any call
// signature. Anything the checker cannot call is reported.
//
// The `any` case deserves naming because it is the OPPOSITE of the usual hazard. Type-aware
// rules in this family normally skip `any` to avoid false positives; this one reports it, since
// an `any` has no call signature. So the standing warning that the fixture tsconfig's
// `lib: ["ES2022"]` collapses out-of-lib types to the error type — whose flags report `any` —
// would silently flip a verdict in most rules here and CANNOT do so in this one in the reporting
// direction.
//
// It was still measured rather than assumed, because this rule touches `setTimeout` and
// `Function`, which are exactly the globals that library pinning affects. Every case was run
// twice, once under the bare fixture tsconfig and once with a second file declaring
// `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate`, `execScript` and `window`. NO VERDICT MOVED.
// The reason is that an unresolved global gets no symbol at all, and the same-file-declaration
// filter treats a nil symbol as "not declared here" and lets the finding through — which is the
// same answer a properly resolved DOM global produces. So this rule is insensitive to the
// missing DOM lib, unlike `await-thenable`, where three cases inverted.
//
// # Where the two upstreams disagree: PARENTHESES ON THE CALLEE
//
// Both implementations register exactly TWO listeners (`CallExpression` and `NewExpression`),
// carry the same two messages, ship `schema: []` so there are no options, and offer no fix and
// no suggestion. Counted on both sides rather than assumed — this rule has no equivalent of the
// fourth `await-thenable` arm that tsgolint lacks.
//
// They diverge on one axis, and it is a clean sweep rather than a single case. Measured by
// running `@typescript-eslint`'s rule through ESLint's Linter API against tsgolint through this
// adapter, on identical inputs:
//
//	(setTimeout)('x = 1', 0)              tsgolint SILENT   @typescript-eslint REPORTS
//	((setTimeout))('x = 1', 0)            tsgolint SILENT   @typescript-eslint REPORTS
//	(window).setTimeout('x = 1', 0)       tsgolint SILENT   @typescript-eslint REPORTS
//	(window.setTimeout)('x = 1', 0)       tsgolint SILENT   @typescript-eslint REPORTS
//	new (Function)('a')                   tsgolint SILENT   @typescript-eslint REPORTS
//	(Function)('a')                       tsgolint SILENT   @typescript-eslint REPORTS
//
// The cause is structural rather than a decision either author made. ESLint's ESTree has no
// parenthesized-expression node at all, so `node.callee` is already the identifier and the
// question never arises. typescript-go keeps `KindParenthesizedExpression` as a real node, and
// tsgolint's `ast.IsIdentifier` / `ast.IsAccessExpression` tests simply fail on it. Neither side
// wrote a paren skip; one tree hands its rule the unwrapped node and the other does not.
//
// tsgolint wins, because oxlint runs tsgolint and the differential harness compares against
// oxlint. Reproducing `@typescript-eslint`'s answer would be a difference the harness could see,
// for no gain, and it would also be a change to the algorithm rather than a move of it. The corpus
// writes no parenthesized form anywhere, so this whole axis is invisible to the imported fixtures
// and is pinned by measured cases below.
//
// The ARGUMENT side falls the other way and that asymmetry is real: `setTimeout(('x = 1'), 0)`
// REPORTS and `setTimeout((() => {}), 0)` is SILENT. Nothing skips the parens there either —
// they simply do not need to be skipped, because `isFunction` reaches the checker for a
// parenthesized expression and the checker sees straight through to the inner type. One rule,
// two answers, and only measurement separates them.
//
// # One arm of `isFunctionType` is subsumed, measured rather than argued
//
// `isFunctionType` answers true three ways: the symbol carries `Function`/`Method` flags, the type
// is builtin-`Function`-like, or the type has at least one call signature. Neutralizing the FIRST
// arm changes no verdict, and that was established by measurement rather than by reasoning.
//
// Twelve shapes were probed, chosen to cover every way TypeScript produces a Function- or
// Method-flagged symbol: a function declaration, a function expression, a shorthand object method,
// a class method, an overloaded function, a generic function, a namespace-merged function, a
// `declare function`, an abstract method, an interface method, plus an enum member and a bare
// namespace as controls that report. The rule was run over all twelve with the arm intact and
// again with it neutralized, and the two verdict lists were compared: IDENTICAL, including the two
// controls that report either way.
//
// The reason is that a symbol flagged `Function` or `Method` always has a call signature, so the
// third arm already answers every input the first one could. That makes this SUBSUMED rather than
// a fixture blind spot, which is why no fixture was added for it: a test written against an
// unreachable distinction asserts nothing while reading as coverage.
//
// The arm is kept because absorption is a move rather than a rewrite: dropping a branch measured to
// be verdict-neutral would still be an edit to logic this pass promised not to touch. It is also a
// cheap short-circuit that avoids building a signature list, so it is plausibly there for cost
// rather than for behavior.
//
// # The checker, and the nil guard that now lives here
//
// The listener reads `ctx.TypeChecker` unconditionally, so this needs the checker and its
// fixtures use `RunTyped`. While this rule was adapted, the standing
// `if ctx.TypeChecker == nil { return }` could not be written, because the listener was upstream's
// and editing it would have turned a re-sync into a merge. `upstream.Adapt` set `NeedsTypeChecker`
// on every rule it wrapped, so the nil case was unreachable through it. Absorbing the rule removes
// that constraint AND makes the nil case reachable, so the guard is now written where the advice
// always wanted it, and it is the one addition to the body.
//
// The guard matters more here than a crash-avoidance would suggest, and this rule is the sharpest
// illustration in the family. `ctx.TypeChecker.GetSymbolAtLocation` and `GetTypeAtLocation` on this
// shim return nil rather than panicking, and `isFunction` treats a type it cannot call as NOT a
// function — so a checker-less run would not crash, it would report EVERY `setTimeout(fn, 0)` in
// the corpus while the same-file filter let each one through on a nil symbol. That is worse than a
// vacuous green: it is a vacuous RED, forty eight clean fixtures inverting at once. A test in this
// package pins the declaration and the guard together so a later revert fails loudly.
//
// # Cost
//
// The anchor is every call and every `new`, which is a hot kind, but the first thing the listener
// does is read the callee's NAME and return when it is neither a bare identifier nor a
// global-candidate access. That is a syntactic test with no checker involvement, so the
// overwhelming majority of calls in a real file exit before the type graph is touched.
