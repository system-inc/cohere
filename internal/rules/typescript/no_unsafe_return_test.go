// `strict: true`, so every case was measured against the installed 8.67.0 build under BOTH settings
// rather than assumed to transfer. All thirty are clean under both, so nothing in this list depends
// on which one is in force. The single case whose verdict does move is in the firing test, at the id
// our configuration produces.
//
// Several of these are the false positives a plausible port ships. Returning `any` where `unknown`
// was declared is SAFE, and so is `any[]` into `unknown[]` and `Promise<any>` into a function whose
// awaited return is `unknown`, because `unknown` forces the caller to narrow. An explicit `any`
// return annotation is a decision the author made and is respected. And a `Promise<any>` returned
// from a synchronous function is not this rule's finding.
