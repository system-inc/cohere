// Ported from `typescript/no-unnecessary-parameter-property-assignment`, which oxc in turn ports
// from `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-parameter-property-assignment`.
//
// # What counts as a parameter property, measured rather than assumed
//
// Upstream's `FormalParameter::has_modifier` is `accessibility.is_some() || readonly || override`.
// Our tree spells the same set as `ModifierFlagsParameterPropertyModifier`, and that equivalence is
// a measurement rather than a reading: probed across `public`, `private`, `protected`, `readonly`,
// `override`, a bare parameter and a decorated one, the flag answers true for exactly the first
// five and false for the last two, agreeing with `has_modifier` on all seven. `override` is the
// one that surprises, since it creates no property of its own, and `ModifierFlagsAccessibilityModifier`
// would have silently dropped both it and `readonly`. Pinned upstream too: `override foo: string`
// and `readonly foo: string` each report on the release binary.
//
// # The walk stops at an assignment, and that is what the arrow cases are really about
//
// Upstream's visitor overrides `visit_assignment_expression` and never calls the default walker
// from it, so an assignment expression is a dead end: neither side is descended into. It separately
// overrides `visit_function`, which stops function declarations, function expressions and methods
// because each rebinds `this`. An arrow function is NOT stopped, because it closes over `this`.
//
// Reading the corpus alone suggests the opposite, because the one clean arrow case
// (`this.bar = () => { this.foo = foo; }`) looks like evidence that arrows are skipped. It is not.
// That case is clean because the enclosing assignment is the dead end, and the arrow is never
// reached at all. Measured on the release binary, with the arrow moved out from under an
// assignment: `call(() => { this.foo = foo; })` reports, and a bare `(() => { this.foo = foo; });`
// expression statement reports. Both would be silent under an arrow skip. A port that skipped
// arrows would pass every imported fixture and go silent on both of those.
//
// # A prior write to the parameter does NOT rescue the assignment
//
// `constructor(public foo: string) { foo = foo.trim(); this.foo = foo; }` **reports** on the
// release binary, even though the property and the parameter now genuinely differ. Upstream's
// `assigned_before_unnecessary` set records only targets of the form `this.X`, so a plain write to
// the binding is invisible to it. That is unsound and it is reproduced deliberately, with a fixture,
// because the gate runs oxlint and a port that quietly fixed it would read as a difference. The
// intuitive reading is recorded here so the next reader does not helpfully correct it back.
//
// # Parentheses fall two different ways inside one assignment
//
// oxc's parser has already dropped the parentheses around an assignment target by the time the rule
// sees it, while ours keeps a real ParenthesizedExpression node. So reproducing upstream means
// adding a skip our tree needs and upstream's source does not show. Measured on the release binary:
//
//	(this.foo) = foo    reports, and the span is the whole `(this.foo) = foo`
//	this.foo = (foo)    reports, via `get_inner_expression()` on the right
//	(this).foo = foo    SILENT, because the `this` object is matched by kind with no unwrapping
//
// Three inputs, three different answers, in one rule. The corpus writes none of them.
//
// # The class-body scan is position-independent and reads only property initializers
//
// A property definition anywhere in the class whose initializer assigns to `this.X`, directly or
// through an immediately invoked function, suppresses the finding for `X`. Measured both ways:
// `init = (this.foo = 1)` silences the constructor whether it is written above the constructor or
// below it. A sibling *method* assigning `this.foo` does not silence it, because a method is not a
// property definition. All three pinned on the release binary.
//
// # The repair is a suggestion rather than a fix, and upstream's range eats one blind byte
//
// Upstream calls `diagnostic_with_suggestion` and declares `suggestion` in its metadata, so `--fix`
// alone applies nothing and only `--fix-suggestions` does. The range is the assignment's span plus
// one trailing byte, which is the semicolon in every case the corpus writes. It is blind: measured
// on the release binary, `this.foo = foo` with no semicolon has its newline eaten and the next line
// joined, and `this.foo = foo, bar();` has its comma eaten, leaving ` bar();`. Reproduced exactly,
// as a suggestion, because a suggestion is the vehicle upstream chose and a human sees it before it
// lands. Shipping this as a fix would let the engine apply those two rewrites unattended.
