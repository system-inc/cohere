// into files nobody is reading, and the cost lands all at once on the upgrade that finally drops it.
//
// Some of these are worse than a rename. Tailwind 4 shifted the unsuffixed scale steps, so `shadow`
// still resolves but to a different size than it did before, which is a silent visual change rather
// than a broken class.
//
// Matching is against the class's base, with variants and importance stripped and then restored in
// the fix, so `sm:hover:flex-grow-2!` becomes `sm:hover:grow-2!`. Measured against upstream rather
// than assumed: the plugin dissects the class and matches the base, and a port that matched the raw
// name would miss every prefixed use, which is most of them in real markup.
