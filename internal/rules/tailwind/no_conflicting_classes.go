//
// Only one of two conflicting classes takes effect, and which one is decided by the order Tailwind
// emitted its stylesheet in rather than the order the author wrote them. So the markup reads as
// though it says one thing and renders as though it says another, and editing the order of the
// class list does not change the outcome, which is what makes this genuinely confusing to debug.
//
// Three distinctions decide what conflicts, all measured against the real plugin rather than
// reasoned about, and each one inverts an answer if it is lost:
//
// Property names, not values. `w-8` and `h-8` declare the same value under `width` and `height` and
// do not conflict; they collapse into `size-8`, which is a different rule's finding. `px-4` and
// `px-8` declare different values under one property and do conflict.
//
// Shorthands are not normalised. `p-4` and `px-8` visually overlap and upstream reports no conflict,
// because `padding` and `padding-inline` are different property names. Normalising them here would
// invent a finding upstream does not report.
//
// Variants are part of the identity. `flex hover:block` is not a conflict, because the two apply in
// different states and both take effect in the state they belong to. `hover:flex hover:block` is a
// conflict. A port that compared bare class names would report the first and be wrong on correct
// code, which is how a rule gets disabled.
//
// Reported symmetrically, matching upstream: `flex block` produces two findings, one anchored at
// each class. A port emitting one finding per pair under-reports by half.
//
// The fix is a Suggestion rather than a Fix, deliberately. Removing either class changes what
// renders, and only the author knows which one was meant. The edit engine never applies
// suggestions, so this is the difference between a repair a human chooses and one that silently
// picks for them.

// # Why this stopped being a table
//
// `RootSelectorShapes` held those eight entries and its own comment worked out why that was not
// enough: the invariance measurement, 327 roots on ahra against 302 on an independent system both
// yielding the same 8, was "necessary and insufficient", because a repository `@utility` block can
// declare a nested selector that no corpus writes. The argument for keeping it was that such a class
// resolves to false before any pairing, so the gap cannot produce a wrong finding.
//
// That is true and it is a reason the defect is survivable rather than a reason the table is right.
// The handle bodies are ported, the wrapper is in them, so the shape is computable and the question
// of what a table might be missing does not arise.
//
// A repository `@utility` block still answers `.CLASS`, and that is upstream's answer rather than a
// default: `@utility` takes a declaration list, not a selector, so a block has no way to declare a
