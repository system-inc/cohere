// Build-once, asserted against the repository the tool actually lints rather than against a fixture.
//
// `TestDesignSystemIsBuiltOncePerProgram` in design_system_test.go already counts builds across a
// real `program.Graph.Walk`, and that test is the one that fails fastest and runs everywhere. This
// file is the second half of the same claim, and it exists because a 40-file temporary directory
// cannot reach three things the shipped run does:
//
//   - **The real design system.** The fixture's stylesheet is six directives and a two-token
//     stand-in for the framework. This repository's is a nine-file `@import` graph resolving 744
//     theme entries and 37 `@utility` blocks. A rebuild that costs 78µs against the fixture costs
//     0.68ms here, and a build path that is cheap enough to hide in the fixture's noise is not
//     cheap enough to hide in this one.
//   - **All nine rules asking at once.** The fixture walks a single probe rule. The shipped run has
//     nine rules calling `DesignSystemForProgram` on every file, which is the arrangement where a
//     per-rule cache rather than a per-run one would still pass a single-rule test. Nine rules over
//     3,481 files is 31,329 calls to a function that must build exactly once.
//   - **The full worker pool on a tree big enough to use it.** `Workers()` clamps to the file count,
//     so the 40-file fixture is not obviously short but the real tree is unambiguously at the
//     16-checker ceiling this machine allows, striding across files for long enough that a racing
//     second build has room to happen.
//
// The counter is process-scoped, so what is asserted is a delta across the walk rather than an
// absolute. That is deliberate: `go test` runs this package's tests in one process, and an absolute
// assertion here would be a test that passes or fails on which other tests ran first.
//
// Every helper is prefixed `liveWalk` for the reason design_system_test.go states: several agents
// work in this package at once, and a helper whose name does not say which component owns it is a
// collision waiting to happen.

// liveWalkRepository is the tree this assertion runs against.
//
// The same absolute path the rest of the live suites in this package use, with the same skip when it
// is absent. A machine without this checkout gets a skipped test rather than a failing one, because
// what is under test is a property of the rules and not a property of the machine.
const liveWalkRepository = "/Users/kirkouimet/Projects/ahra"

// liveWalkRules is every rule in this package, as the shipped run registers them.
//
// Listed rather than read back out of the catalog, because the catalog is global and another
// package's rules landing in it would change what this test walks without anyone editing this file.
// If a tenth Tailwind rule is added and not added here, this test keeps passing while covering less,
// which `TestLiveWalkCoversEveryRegisteredTailwindRule` below turns into a failure.

// this component's file comment quotes, and the gap is the table: that figure was taken before the
// table moved onto this path, so it now understates the waste by more than half.
