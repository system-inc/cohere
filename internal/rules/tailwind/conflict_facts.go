// Live conflict resolution: what a class declares, asked of this repository's own `@utility` blocks
// first and of the framework's generated tables second.
//
// This is `no-conflicting-classes`'s half of the seam #3r6cxrb crosses, and it is the one where the
// answer is a split rather than a swap. The seam is drawn where it is because it was measured, and
// the measurement is below rather than in a commit message so the next person does not have to
// re-run it to know whether to trust the boundary.
//
// # What moved
//
// The class is now dissected by `ParseCandidate` against the live design system rather than by a
// prefix walk over the framework's root table. That fixes the same defect
// `enforce-canonical-classes` had: the walk re-derived where a root ends, and which roots exist is a
// question about this repository's `@utility` blocks as much as about the framework.
//
// The repository's own utilities are then answered by compiling them. `UtilityEvaluator.Compile`
// returns the declaration list of an `@utility` block, and its properties are the real CSS property
// names the class emits. Measured on the corpus: 85 classes are answered this way, every one an
// ahra or www-connected-app theme utility such as `background--0` or `content--placeholder`, and
// every one of them a class the framework tables can only answer because the generator was run
// against a repository that declared it.
//
// # What moved next, and why a reading was never the substitute
//
// The framework's own utilities were on `RootDeclaredProperties` and three companions until
// #mz0m6k8, and the reason given here was that nothing in shipped Go could produce the answer:
// compiling `px-4` needs the framework's utility handlers, which is `utilities.ts`, 6,827 lines,
// and porting it had been rejected twice.
//
// That is no longer true. The handle bodies are ported across three files in the engine package,
// and `DeclaredPropertiesFor` runs them, so a class's declared properties are computed the way the
// engine computes them. The four tables, 1,183 entries and 62 KB, are deleted.
//
// The shortcut this comment warned against is still the wrong one, and naming it is still worth the
// space because it is the obvious move for anyone reading the emitters for the first time.
// `Table.Lookup` returns `Order`, indices into `PropertyOrder`, invertible to property names. It got
// 1,355 of the corpus's 1,530 resolvable classes right and 75 wrong. The port does not use it, and
// the 75 say why:
//
//   - **The two table families answer deliberately different questions.**
//     `OrderingPropertiesByRoot`'s own comment states it: the ordering tables keep `--tw-*` custom
//     properties because they are what separates `shadow-lg` from `ring-1` in the sort, and a
//     conflict answer strips them because two classes both setting `--tw-border-style` are not in
//     conflict about anything an author sees. Stripping them from a reading recovers `[box-shadow]`
//     for both, which is right, and leaves `outline-none` and `ring-neutral-800` with nothing at all.
//   - **A `--tw-sort` override replaces the reading entirely.** `divide-y` reads `divide-y-width`,
//     which is not a CSS property and is not what the class declares; the class emits
//     `border-top-width`, `border-top-style` and their bottom pair. `PropertySort`'s own comment
//     records the latch that produces this. 8 corpus classes, all `divide-*`.
//   - **A reading is a sorted set of positions, not a declaration list.** `backdrop-blur-sm`
//     declares `-webkit-backdrop-filter` and `backdrop-filter`; only one has a position.
//
// Every one of those is a fact the declaration list has and the reading has thrown away, which is
// why `DeclaredPropertiesFor` asks the emitters for the list and never touches a reading.
//
// # What the deletion fixed rather than preserved
//
// A generated table knows the repository it was generated from. Measured: 29 of ahra's roots and 27
// of www-connected-app's were absent from `RootDeclaredProperties`, and 8 of ahra's own `@utility`
// blocks were captured INTO `StaticDeclaredProperties` as though they were Tailwind's. Computing the
// framework half and compiling the repository half puts each answer with the source that owns it.
//
// One answer changed, and it is a correction. `RootDeclaredProperties` stored
// `{font-size, line-height}` for root `text`; upstream emits the line height only when a modifier is
// written, so `text-[10px]` declares one property and `text-[10px]/6` declares two. 11 corpus
// occurrences moved, and the rule got stricter rather than quieter: a class claiming `line-height`
// it does not set is a class that fails to conflict with `leading-6` when it should.
//
// # The honest state of the boundary
//
// Two of this rule's tables remain, counted rather than estimated. `ComposingRoots` decides whether
// two values of a root layer or overwrite, which a declaration list cannot see because it carries no
// values; it is task #mz0m6k8's sibling P4 and is deliberately untouched here so the two changes do
// not race in one file.
//
// `ColorNames` is the other, and it is genuinely per-repository and still generated, which makes it a
// real gap rather than a settled seam: a repository that defines its own palette has different color names,
// and this rule reads Tailwind's. It is narrowed rather than closed here, since the theme is asked
// first so a repository's own colors are recognised, and what remains is the framework's default
// palette as a fallback for a repository that did not override it.
//
// # RootSelectorShapes, and why it stays without being invariant
//
// The eighth table is `RootSelectorShapes`, read by `selectorShapeOf`. Measured two ways rather than
// assumed, because "reads like framework data" is what was said about `CollapseFamilies` and the
// variant registrations before a measurement that could not have detected a repository token.
//
// First, generated against `independent_theme.css` and diffed. That is two observations rather than
// one wearing two names: 327 roots and 53,301 pairs on ahra against 302 and 45,451 on the
// independent system. Both produce the same 8 entries, same roots, same shapes, none on either side
// alone.
//
// That measurement is necessary and NOT sufficient, and the second one says why. A repository
// `@utility` block can declare a nested selector, and a synthetic one that does contributes a ninth
// entry: `@utility gutter-*` wrapping `& > :not(:last-child)` enumerates as
// `gutter -> .CLASS > :not(:last-child)`. So the table is repository-invariant across the systems
// that exist rather than by construction, and a repository that wrote such a block would have a root
// whose shape this table does not carry.
//
// It stays generated anyway, because that class cannot reach the comparison the shape decides.
// `repositoryClassFacts` counts only top-level declarations, and a nested block compiles to a single
// `rule` node carrying no property at all, so the class resolves to false and is skipped before any
// pairing. Measured on exactly that fixture: `gutter-small` beside `me-4` and beside `mr-4`, both
// margin-inline-end on the element itself, produces zero findings.
//
// So a missing shape costs a finding this rule was never going to make rather than producing a wrong
// one, which is the safe direction and the same direction every other gap here fails in.
// TestSelectorShapeCannotProduceAWrongFinding holds that, so it cannot decay into a claim.
