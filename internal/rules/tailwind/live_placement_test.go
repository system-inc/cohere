// The corpus placement measurement for the rules moved onto the live design system.
//
// # Why a placement count and not only a findings count
//
// This is the acceptance criterion #3r6cxrb was written around, and it exists because of the way the
// previous attempt failed. A migration is scored by comparing the rule's answers before and after,
// and a rule that stops having answers scores perfectly on every comparison that only counts
// disagreements: silence reads as agreement. `#4q5dsn3` was blocked over exactly that, on a
// regression check that named a number without naming the population it had to be measured over.
//
// So every measurement here reports how many classes the rule actually PLACED — resolved to a root,
// or to a property set, or to an existence answer — beside whatever else it reports. A rule that went
// quiet fails on the denominator rather than passing on the rate.
//
// # The corpus
//
// `internal/tailwind/testdata/variant_fixtures.json`, the same 2,396 class lists and 11,314 class
// occurrences `class_order_live_test.go` measures against, captured from two real repositories. Real
// literals rather than constructed ones, because the failure these rules have historically had is on
// shapes nobody would think to construct.
//
// Every helper here is prefixed `livePlacement` for the reason design_system_test.go states: several
// agents work in this package at once, and a helper whose name does not say which component owns it
// is a collision waiting to happen.

// livePlacementCorpus is the slice of variant_fixtures.json this file reads.
