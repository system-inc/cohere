			"silently will not apply. Write the whole class names out and switch between them, rather " +
			"than assembling one from pieces.",

//
// Tailwind finds the classes it must generate by scanning source text for things that look like
// class names. A class assembled at runtime never appears as text, so it is never generated, and the
// failure is entirely silent: the markup is correct, the class is on the element, and the rule that
// would style it was never written into the stylesheet. Nothing errors and the layout is simply
// wrong on one breakpoint until somebody notices.
//
// The name understates what the rule checks. It is not "was this string built dynamically" but "does
// a class fragment touch an interpolation with no whitespace at the seam", and the difference is the
// whole rule: `flex ${extra}` is fine because `flex` is a complete class name that Tailwind can see,
// while `px-${size}` is not because `px-` is not a class name at all.
//
// Measured against the upstream plugin rather than inferred from it, because two readings of the
// name are wrong in opposite directions. Reporting every interpolated class literal would flag 141
// literals in the ahra tree that are all fine. Reporting none, or reading `+` concatenation as the
// same defect, misses the real thing: upstream stays silent on `'px-' + size` and on
// `'bg-[' + color + ']'`, and fires only on template interpolation. A first version of the
// measurement harness for this port reported four `+` findings on the real tree and every one was a
// false positive.
//
// No fix, deliberately. The repair is to write out the class names the code is choosing between,
// which means knowing which ones those are. A rule cannot know that, and a fix that guessed would
// produce a class list the author never intended.
