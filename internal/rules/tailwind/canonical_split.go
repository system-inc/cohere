// The live candidate split: a class broken into the pieces that decide whether it can merge, using
// this repository's own roots.
//
// This is `enforce-canonical-classes`'s half of the seam #3r6cxrb crosses. Until this file, the
// split walked `RootDeclaredProperties` looking for the longest prefix that was followed by a dash,
// and that map is generated from one repository. After it, the split is `ParseCandidate`'s, which
// asks the design system where a root ends.
//
// # Why the walk had to go, and it is not that it was slow
//
// `splitCandidate`'s own comment recorded the failure it had already survived three times: a
// dash-splitter reads `border-l` as root `border` with value `l`, buckets it away from `border-r`,
// and silently stops reporting `border-x`. The fix was to match the longest registered root instead,
// which is right in outline and still an approximation, because "registered" meant a table.
//
// candidate.go states the general form of the problem: where a class's root ends is not a property
// of its string. `border-b` reads both as the functional root `border-b` with no value and as
// `border` with the named value `b`, and which roots exist is a question about this repository's
// `@utility` blocks as much as about the framework. So the prefix walk answers correctly exactly
// when the table happens to describe the repository in front of it.
//
// Measured: 26 of `KnownRoots`'s 315 entries are roots the ahra repository declares in its own
// stylesheet, carried under a `Source: Tailwind 4.3.3` header. On a repository that declares
// different ones, the walk finds roots that do not exist there and misses the ones that do.
//
// # What the gate already promised, and what this keeps
//
// `internal/tailwind/gate.go:227` takes `candidates[0]` with a measurement attached: the first
// reading preserves every collapse the engine finds, over all 4,375 candidate pairs in the real
// corpus, of which 75 collapse, with zero lost to that choice. This file takes the same first
// reading for the same reason, so the property that was measured before the parser existed is the
// property the parser is now used under.
//
// # The one thing that does not move
//
// `CollapseFamilies` stays generated, and that is a measurement rather than an omission. A collapse
// family is a fact about which framework roots merge into a third when everything else agrees, and a
// repository's `@utility` block adds roots without creating merge relationships among framework
// ones. Verified by generating against both corpus repositories: 44 families each, zero on either
// side alone. That check is recorded on #3r6cxrb rather than inferred here.

// A first version returned `Value.Value` and was wrong twice, on 88 real corpus classes:

//   - **The modifier is a sibling field, not part of the value.** `bg-black/20` parses as root `bg`,

//     compare equal on the merge precondition, which is exactly the permissive direction
//     `enforce-canonical-classes`'s own comment warns reports correct code. 84 of the 88 were this.
//
//     A NAMED modifier is also mirrored into `Fraction`, so the fraction branch below happens to
//     cover it and the modifier branch is only reachable for an ARBITRARY one:
//     `bg-emerald-500/[0.07]` parses with `Fraction` empty and modifier `[0.07]`. That is worth
//     stating because it is what a mutation found — removing the modifier branch left every named
//     modifier correct and silently dropped the arbitrary ones, which is one corpus class and would
//     have looked like an unused branch to anyone reading it.
//
//   - **A fraction is carried beside the value rather than inside it.** `-translate-x-1/2` parses as
//     value `1` with `Fraction` set to `1/2`, because the slash is genuinely ambiguous and the
//     parser refuses to guess: `w-1/2` is a fraction and `bg-red-500/50` is a modifier, spelled
//     identically. `ParsedValue.Fraction`'s own comment says so. Returning `1` would rebuild
//     `-translate-x-1/2` as `-translate-1` and merge it with anything else valued `1`.
//
// The fraction is preferred when present because it is the whole `value/modifier` text, so taking it
// and the modifier both would print the slash twice.
//
// Removing the fraction branch is an EQUIVALENT mutation on this corpus and is left in anyway.
// Measured: over every corpus class carrying a fraction, reconstructing `value + "/" + modifier`
// produces the fraction text exactly, 0 differing of all of them, because a named modifier is
// mirrored into Fraction by the parser. The branch stays because the equivalence is the parser's
// current behaviour rather than a documented guarantee, and `ParsedValue.Fraction` is the field that
// says what the text was; reconstructing it from two other fields would be relying on a coincidence
// this comment had to measure to discover.
