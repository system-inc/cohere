//
// # Why this is not a formatting rule
//
// Two variants on one class compile to nested rules, and the nesting order is decided by the
// engine's own sort rather than by the order they were written in. So `dark:md:flex` and
// `md:dark:flex` produce byte-identical CSS. Nothing catches the difference: not the compiler, not
// the browser, not a screenshot. What it costs is the same thing every unenforced spelling costs,
// which is that the next reader cannot tell whether two class lists differing only in variant order
// differ for a reason.
//
// # The comparison is deliberately weaker than the engine's full sort
//
// This is the part a reader is most likely to get wrong, and it was measured against
// eslint-plugin-better-tailwindcss 4.7.0 rather than inferred. Upstream's `compareVariantOrder`
// returns 0 when BOTH variants sort below its `GLOBAL` flag, so two element-scoped variants are
// left exactly as written: `hover:focus:` and `focus:hover:` are both accepted, and reporting
// either would be a divergence.
//
// A variant carries the global flag when every selector it generates is free of `&`, which is
// upstream's `hasGlobalSelector`. Those are the media and at-rule variants, and they must sort
// ahead of anything scoped to an element because that is the nesting the engine emits. Among two
// globals the sort is descending by registration order, which is what makes `sm:lg:` report as
// `lg:sm:` rather than the other way around.
//
// verify cannot compute the flag the way upstream does. The variant registry carries registration
// order and kind but not the selector bodies, because `variant.go` deliberately did not port the
// thousand lines of `variants.ts` that build CSS. So the set is named here instead, and it was
// enumerated by measurement rather than by reading: every framework variant in
// `framework_variant_table.go` was stacked under `hover:` and run through upstream, and the ones
// that moved ahead are exactly these. See globalSelectorVariants.
//
// # Not fixable, for the same reason ordering is not
//
// The rewrite is mechanical and the rule knows the answer. It is left out because a class literal
// in this codebase wraps across lines with indentation that carries intent, and a fixer that
// rewrote one class in place would still be the first thing to reflow the literal around it. The
// sibling `enforce-consistent-class-order` declines a fixer on the same grounds.
//

// fully resolve is one it has no opinion about.
//
// # The rank is per-run, not per-registration, and that is the whole subtlety
//
// A first version of this read `VariantRegistration.Order` straight out of the registry and was
// wrong on the case that matters most. `sm` and `lg` share registration order 64, because the
// framework registers every named breakpoint inside one `Variants.group`, so a comparison on
// registration numbers answers "equal" and leaves `sm:lg:` alone. Upstream reports it.
//
// The number upstream compares is `getVariantOrder()`, which sorts the variants this class list
// parsed and assigns dense indices from zero, breaking the group tie through the comparison
// function attached to order 64: the breakpoints order by their resolved `--breakpoint` widths.
// `BuildVariantOrder` is verify's port of exactly that, so this asks it rather than the registry.
//
// The population is this one class's variants plus their nested sub-variants, which is narrower
// than `enforce-consistent-class-order`'s (the whole literal). That is deliberate and matches
// upstream: `getVariantOrder` is handed every class in the literal, but the comparison only ever
// runs between two variants of the same class, and a dense rank's relative order within a subset is
// the relative order it has in the whole. A wider population shifts indices without reordering them.

// deliberately did not port them: they are the thousand lines of `variants.ts` that build CSS, and
// verify emits none.
//
// So the set is enumerated instead, and it was measured rather than reasoned about. Every framework
// variant in `framework_variant_table.go` was written as `hover:<variant>:flex` and run through
// eslint-plugin-better-tailwindcss 4.7.0; the ones it reordered ahead of `hover` are exactly these
// and nothing else. The shape of the answer is its own check: every member is a media or at-rule
// variant, and the near misses are instructive. `supports-[x]` is not here, because a support query
// wraps a rule that still carries `&`. Neither is `dark`, whose default registration is a selector
// rather than a media query, and neither is `max-md` or `@lg`, which are functional variants whose
// generated rule keeps its element scope.
//
// The named breakpoints are deliberately ABSENT from this map even though they are global, and that
// is the one place a static set would have been wrong rather than merely incomplete. `sm` and `md`
// are not special names: they are whatever `--breakpoint-*` keys the theme declares, and
// `registerThemeBreakpointVariants` registers each of them at the framework breakpoint group's
// order. Upstream's own test suite has a `--breakpoint-desktop: 80rem` fixture expecting
// `hover:desktop:` to report, and a map naming `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl` would have been silent
// on it. So breakpoints are recognised by their registration order instead, which answers for every
// name a repository chooses. See variantSortOrder.
//
// A repository that redefines one of the remaining names with `@custom-variant` changes its
// selectors and so could change its answer. That is a real divergence and it is bounded: it would
// have to redefine a framework media variant as a selector-based one, which inverts the variant's
// meaning rather than tuning it. The alternative, porting the selector machinery to ask the
// question honestly, is the whole CSS half of the engine.
