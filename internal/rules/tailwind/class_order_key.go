// The live class-order sort: one repository's own design system deciding its own class order.
//
// This is the seam #4q5dsn3 exists to cross. Until this file, `enforce-consistent-class-order`
// answered out of `OrderingPropertiesBy{Root,Static,Class}` and `VariantOrder` in
// property_order_table.go, four tables generated from one repository and then shipped as though
// they described Tailwind. After it, the rule asks the repository in front of it.
//
// # Why a list and not a comparator
//
// The shipped rule sorted with `sort.SliceStable(ordered, func(left, right int) bool { … })` over a
// pairwise `classSortsBefore`, and that shape cannot express what the engine does. It is not a
// stylistic difference and it is the whole reason this file replaces a function rather than editing
// one.
//
// `getClassOrder(classes)` takes the entire list. Upstream ranks a candidate by
//
//	let variantOrder = 0n
//	for (let variant of candidate.variants) variantOrder |= 1n << BigInt(variantOrderMap.get(variant)!)
//
// where `variantOrderMap` is `getVariantOrder()`, a *dense index per distinct variant assigned by
// sorting exactly the variants this design system has parsed*. Two consequences, and each one is
// invisible to a pairwise comparator:
//
//   - **The index is a rank within a population, not a fact about a variant.** `dark` is index 3 in
//     one list and index 1 in another, depending on what else is present. A comparator handed two
//     classes has no population to rank within, so it has to invent one, and any per-pair population
//     is a different population from the one the engine used.
//   - **Ties collapse to a shared index.** `BuildVariantOrder` advances the index only when Compare
//     says the next variant differs, so two variants that compare equal carry the *same bit* and
//     their classes interleave by property rather than separating. A pairwise comparator that
//     resolved the tie either way would separate them.
//
// So the population is built once over the whole literal, every class is keyed against it, and the
// sort reads the keys. `tools/gen_tailwind_variant/enumerate.mjs` says the same thing from the
// engine's side: "The design system is fresh per call, because the order map is a function of
// exactly which variants have been parsed into the design system's cache."
//
// # The bug this removes, measured before it was fixed
//
// `#nr3wtj1`. The shipped comparator asserted, at what was enforce_consistent_class_order.go:447,
// that "every single variant precedes every stacked one, whatever they start with." The engine
// implements nothing of the kind. It ORs one bit per variant into a mask and compares masks
// numerically, so a class's position is decided by its *highest-ranked* variant and only ties on
// that are broken by the next bit down. A stacked variant therefore sorts FIRST whenever its
// outermost variant is outranked by the other class's.
//
// Measured on the corpus before this file existed: 15 disagreeing pairs of 4,265 separable pairs
// across 7 class lists. `ahra/list-99` is a real literal in this repository where the engine keeps
// `dark:hover:bg-light-50` (mask 5, two variants) ahead of `[&_svg]:me-3` (mask 8, one variant) and
// the shipped rule reversed them — so the rule reported a finding on correctly ordered code and
// asked the author to break it.
//
// # Declining is a state, and it is not the same state as agreeing
//
// Every function here returns a `found` boolean rather than a zero value, for the reason
// `internal/tailwind`'s differential harness carries a five-state outcome lattice instead of two:
// a side that stops answering scores as agreement in any comparison that folds silence into
// equality, and that is the failure this whole port is guarded against. A class this file cannot
// place is reported as unplaceable, the caller declines to report on the literal, and the rule says
// so rather than emitting a clean tree.
