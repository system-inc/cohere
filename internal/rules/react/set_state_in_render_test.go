// The corpus for this rule is React's own, not oxc's.
//
// oxc's linter rule file carries a single pass case and a single fail case, because its body is
// `run_react_compiler_rule(ctx, ErrorCategory::RenderSetState)` and the judgment lives in the
// compiler crate. React ships ten fixtures whose golden expects `Cannot call setState during
// render`, vendored at `internal/reactconformance/testdata/fixtures`, and every source string below
// is one of them byte for byte. They were copied programmatically and are byte-verified against
// their vendored originals by TestFixturesMatchTheVendoredCorpusByte.
//
// # Four fixtures whose name is not their verdict
//
// Fourteen vendored fixtures match `set.?state` by name. Only ten expect this rule's diagnostic.
// Three expect `Calling setState from useMemo`, which is this validator's OTHER arm, and
// `error.invalid-hoisting-setstate` expects `Cannot access variable before it is declared`, which
// is a different pass entirely. Selecting by filename would have imported a corpus a quarter of
// which asserts something this rule never emits.
//
// # The missing import, which is the whole story of this rule's fixtures
//
// Nine of the ten do not import React. Under the compiler harness that does not matter, because
// React seeds a global table naming `useState` and infers the setter's type by unification from
// there. This port asks the type checker instead, so an unimported `useState` is an undeclared
// global that resolves to nothing and the entire file is `any`.
//
// That is not recoverable and it is not a defect. Measured on the exact fixture body: as written,
// `setX` has a nil type alias and type `any`; with `import {useState} from 'react';` prepended and
// nothing else changed, the same identifier has alias `Dispatch` and type
// `Dispatch<SetStateAction<number>>`. One line of input decides it.
//
// So each fixture is recorded TWICE, and both halves are real assertions rather than one being a
// workaround:
//
//   - `TestSetStateInRenderStaysSilentOnTheCorpusAsWritten` runs the body verbatim and asserts
//     silence. That is the honest verdict for a file where the setter has no type, and it is a
//     genuine guard: a later change that starts guessing from the NAME `setX` rather than from the
//     type would turn these green cases red, which is exactly the divergence worth catching.
//   - `TestSetStateInRenderFires` prepends one import line and asserts the finding. The body is
//     untouched; the prepend is stated in the helper rather than baked into the constant, so the
//     verbatim text stays comparable to upstream.
//
// The pass-rate on the corpus as written is therefore the wrong instrument for this rule, and
// saying so is part of the port rather than an excuse: the trade is a dependency on `@types/react`
// and typed code in exchange for not writing 1,450 lines of unification, and it is a good trade for
// Kirk's tree and a bad one for a conformance score.
//
// # Why a local declaration file rather than the real @types/react
//
// `ruletest`'s tsconfig sets `types: []` and points at a temp directory, deliberately, so that a
// fixture cannot pick up whatever happens to be installed near the test. There is no `node_modules`
// to resolve. `reactStateDeclarations` below is the minimum of `@types/react` this rule reads, and
// the two declarations that matter are copied in the shape upstream writes them: `Dispatch` is a
// TYPE ALIAS and `RefObject` is an INTERFACE. That difference is the rule's whole predicate, so a
// stand-in that made both aliases would test a checker behaviour that does not exist.

// turned out to be a case React REPORTS and this rule did not: the mutant was right and the original

// is inlined into the render graph; a setter declared inside it is an ordinary value of the
// enclosing function and reaches the validator with no capture involved. Every fixture in this file
// reaches its setter through a capture, so none of them could see the guard being wrong.
//
// The three surrounding verdicts were measured at the same time and pin the boundary:
//   - the same body inside `useCallback` is CLEAN, because that callback is not invoked in render
//   - the same body with the call made conditional still REPORTS, because the memoized arm is
