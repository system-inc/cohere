// The upstream corpus is four fixtures and only two of them reach this rule.
//
// React ships `invalid-jsx-in-try-with-catch` and `invalid-jsx-in-catch-in-outer-try-with-catch`,
// which report, and `error.todo-invalid-jsx-in-try-with-finally` and
// `error.todo-invalid-jsx-in-catch-in-outer-try-with-finally`, which do not: those two are named
// `invalid-...` and produce a lowering Todo instead of this rule's finding, which is what the
// `error.todo` prefix records. A porter counting `error.`-named files finds the two that are silent
// and misses both that report, because the reporting pair runs under `@outputMode:"lint"` and lands
// its diagnostic in a `## Logs` block rather than an `## Error` one.
//
// All four are transcribed here verbatim, with the compiler pragma comment removed, and the two
// silent ones are pinned as silent with the reasoning at `ErrorBoundaries`.
//
// Every case beyond those four was measured by running React's own `react-hooks/error-boundaries`
// through the ESLint Linter API on that exact input before it was written down, rather than derived
// from reading the implementation. Reading gave the wrong answer on the finally clauses, on nested
// functions, and on the whole component gate.
