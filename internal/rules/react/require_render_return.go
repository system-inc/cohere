// Ported from `react/require-render-return` in `eslint-plugin-react`, which is the implementation
// that defined this rule. Every behavior recorded below was measured by driving the installed
// build, version 7.37.5, through the ESLint Linter API on inputs written for the question, because
// this rule's corpus is thirteen clean cases and four failing ones and is silent about most of what
// the port has to decide.
//
// `meta.schema` is `[]`, so there is no option surface, and `meta.fixable` is unset, so there is no
// repair to port. One message id.
//
// # The rule is a scope count, not a containment test
//
// The name reads as "does `render` contain a return" and answering that question is how a port gets
// this wrong in both directions at once. Upstream's `ReturnStatement` listener walks the ancestors
// of every return, counting how many function-like scopes it crosses, and marks the return as
// satisfying `render` only when the property named `render` is reached at a depth of one or less.
// So a return written inside a callback in `render` does not count, which is upstream's third
// failing case, and a return written inside an `if` or a `switch` in `render` does count, which is
// two of its clean ones. Blocks, conditionals, loops and switch bodies are transparent; functions
// are not.
//
// The regular expression upstream counts with is `/Function(Expression|Declaration)$/`, and it is
// **unanchored at the front**, so `ArrowFunctionExpression` matches it. A reading that treats
// arrows as transparent is wrong, and it is the natural reading: measured, `render() { var f = () =>
// { return 1; }; }` reports, so an arrow costs a scope exactly as a function expression does.
//
// # Where our AST loses a count, which is the same off-by-one the sibling rules carry
//
// ESLint's `MethodDefinition` is a wrapper whose `value` is a separate `FunctionExpression`, so a
// return written directly in a class method crosses one counted scope on its way out to the
// property node. Our `KindMethodDeclaration` fuses the two, so the same source crosses zero.
// Measured by tracing upstream's own ancestor walk on each of the three shapes the corpus writes:
//
//	class { render() { HERE } }            upstream depth 1, our walk 0
//	class { render = () => { HERE } }      upstream depth 1, our walk 1   (the arrow is a real node)
//	createReactClass({ render: fn() {} })  upstream depth 1, our walk 1   (the expression is real)
//
// So only the class-method row is short and it is short by exactly one, matching what
// `no-did-mount-set-state` documents for the same reason. The correction IS needed, and reasoning
// that it was not is how the first draft of this rule shipped three false negatives.
//
// The argument that failed is worth recording because it is the plausible one: the threshold is
// `depth <= 1` and a DIRECT return in a class method counts 0 here against upstream's 1, which is
// on the same side of the boundary, so the fusion looks harmless. It is not, because the boundary
// is crossed by returns that are NESTED. A return inside a callback in a class method counts 2
// upstream and 1 here, which is the difference between silent and marked, and it silently satisfies
// a `render` that upstream leaves unsatisfied. Three fixtures caught it, including upstream's own
// third failing case.
//
// The correction is applied at the property node rather than in the scope test, because that is
// the only place the missing node's identity is known: an object property's function IS a real
// separate node the walk has already counted, and only a class method or accessor is short.
//
// # The flag is per component, not per render method
//
// Upstream marks `hasReturnStatement` through `components.set`, which walks from the return node up
// to the nearest *registered* component and sets the flag there. Two consequences, both measured
// and neither visible from the corpus.
//
// A class with two `render` methods where only the second returns is **clean**, even though the
// finding would point at the first. Measured: `class H extends React.Component { render() {} render()
// { return <div/>; } }` is clean, and so is the same pair written the other way round, while making
// both empty reports. That is upstream being loose rather than upstream being right, and it is
// reproduced: the flag is a property of the component here too.
//
// The sharper case is a nested class that is **not** a component. `class Outer extends
// React.Component { render() { class Inner { render() { return <div/>; } } } }` is **clean**
// upstream, because `Inner` was never registered, so the walk from the inner return climbs past it
// and marks `Outer`. Write `class Inner extends React.Component` instead and `Outer` reports, since
// the flag then lands on `Inner`. This is a genuine false negative in upstream and it is
// reproduced rather than improved on, with fixtures pinning both halves. Established by running
// both shapes against the installed build rather than by reading `Components.set`.
//
// # What counts as a component, and it is narrower than the shelf
//
// The rule's own `Program:exit` filter re-tests `isES5Component || isES6Component`, which throws
// away everything else `Components.detect` registered. So the stateless function components, the
// `memo` and `forwardRef` wrappers, and the arrow components the detection layer collects can never
// reach a finding, and none of that machinery needs porting. Confirmed by measuring: a `memo`-wrapped
// object literal carrying an empty `render` is clean, as is a plain function component.
//
// The ES5 factory name is `createReactClass` alone, not the wider set `internal/utils/react`
// accepts. `getCreateClassFromContext` defaults to the literal string `createReactClass` and only a
// `settings.react.createClass` entry changes it, which our config has no surface for. Measured on
// the installed build: `createClass({ render: function() {} })` and its `React.createClass` twin are
// both clean, while `createReactClass` and `React.createReactClass` both report. This calls
// `isEs5ComponentCallStrict` in `no_did_mount_set_state.go`, which is that same narrowing and
// already shared by three rules in this package.
//
// The ES6 base set is the shelf's and agrees with upstream here, including on the parenthesized
// receiver. `class H extends (React.Component) { render() {} }` **reports** upstream, measured,
// which is the opposite of what `no-direct-mutation-state` records for oxc. The shelf skips
// parentheses and is therefore right for this rule, and the divergence its doc comment warns about
// does not apply.
//
// Upstream also accepts a class declared a component by a JSDoc `@extends React.Component` tag,
// through `isExplicitComponent`. That is not ported. Measured: the tag is clean on the installed
// build in this repository's configuration both with and without a superclass, because
// `sourceCode.getJSDocComment` returns nothing for the shapes tried, so reproducing the branch
// would add findings upstream does not produce here rather than match it.
//
// # There is no file gate
//
// Upstream has none, and this rule does not add one. Three rules in this package gate on `.tsx` and
// `.jsx` because they were ported from oxc, which declares `should_run` on `source_type().is_jsx()`.
// That gate is oxc's own; `eslint-plugin-react` reports identically whatever the extension, and
// carrying it here would cost every finding in a `.ts` file. Pinned by a fixture running one source
// under four extensions.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// At the property node that holds `render`, not at its function and not at the class. Measured
// against the installed build on each shape: `render() {}` underlines eleven characters including
// the empty body, `render: function() {}` underlines twenty-one, and a `render = () => {...}`
// property underlines the whole declaration across its lines. Upstream reports
// `node: findRenderMethod(component.node)`, and `findRenderMethod` returns the property rather than
// the value, so a port anchoring on the function would carry the right message and the wrong span.
// Every fixture below asserts the sliced text.
var RequireRenderReturn = rule.Rule{

// isRenderReturnFunctionScope reports whether an ancestor costs a scope on upstream's count.
//
// Upstream tests `/Function(Expression|Declaration)$/` against the node type, and the pattern is
// unanchored at the front, so it matches `FunctionExpression`, `FunctionDeclaration` AND
// `ArrowFunctionExpression`. That last one is the trap: an arrow reads as transparent and is not.
// Measured, `render() { var f = () => { return 1; }; }` reports.
//
// A method declaration is absent, and its absence is exact rather than an oversight. Upstream's
// `MethodDefinition` is not itself function-like and never matches the pattern; the
// `FunctionExpression` it wraps is what gets counted, and our fused node has no such inner scope
// to count. See the rule doc for why the resulting off-by-one cannot move a verdict at this
// threshold. The accessors are absent for the same reason.
