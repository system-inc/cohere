//
// Ported from `react/no-danger-with-children`, read against oxc's `no_danger_with_children.rs`.
// The corpus is 17 passing and 14 failing inputs from that file's single tester block, and the
// snapshot carries 14 diagnostics, exactly one per failing input.
//
// # Children arrive three ways and all three are the corpus
//
// A `children` attribute (`<div children="Children" />`), content nested between the tags
// (`<div>Children</div>`), and the arguments after the props object in a `createElement` call.
// Upstream tests all three against both an intrinsic element and a component, which is why the
// fail list has near-duplicate `div` and `Hello` pairs: the rule deliberately does not care
// whether the tag is a host element, and dropping either half of each pair would leave that
// indifference untested.
//
// # Why this needs the type checker, when the sibling rule beside it does not
//
// Because a spread is not a dead end here. `no-children-prop` reads attributes that are written
// out, so a spread carries nothing for it to read and it declines. This rule instead follows the
// spread to the variable it names and asks what that object holds, which is `find_var_in_scope`
// upstream, built on `ctx.scoping().find_binding`. That is name resolution rather than a scope
// flag, so by the split in the porting brief it is the kind of question that costs a checker, and
// `GetSymbolAtLocation` is what answers it here. Five of the fourteen failing inputs and three of
// the seventeen passing ones turn on this, so a version without the checker would not be a
// slightly narrower port, it would get eight of thirty one corpus cases wrong.
//
// Measured rather than assumed, on the corpus itself. Every spread and every identifier in the
// props position resolves to a declaration node, and the three that must not resolve fail for the
// right reason rather than by accident:
//
//	const { a, b, ...props } = otherProps   resolves to a BindingElement, not a VariableDeclaration
//	<Hello {...undefined}>                  resolves to a symbol carrying no declarations
//	React.createElement("Hello", undefined) same
//
// Upstream declines the first by destructuring `AstKind::VariableDeclarator` and the other two by
// `find_binding` finding nothing, so all three stay clean here for the same reasons they do there
// rather than because this port happens to stop early.
//
// # The callee test is written inline, and that is deliberate
//
// `utilsreact.IsCreateElementCall` is on the shelf and is the wrong helper for this rule. Its own
// doc comment says so, naming this rule: oxc destructures a `StaticMemberExpression` here and
// returns early on anything else, so upstream never sees a bare `createElement(...)`, never
// rejects `document.createElement`, and never accepts `React["createElement"]`. Calling the shared
// helper would make this rule report where upstream is silent, and no imported fixture could catch
// it because the corpus writes every call as `React.createElement`. The inline test below is
// upstream's, and `TestNoDangerWithChildrenMatchesUpstreamsNarrowerCalleeTest` pins each of the
// three differences so a later tidy-up toward the shelf fails loudly.
//
// # Where a whitespace child counts and where it does not
//
// `<Hello dangerouslySetInnerHTML={...}> </Hello>` reports and the same element written across two
// lines does not. That reads like a bug and it is upstream's judgment, reproduced: a single space
// between the tags is real content that React would render, while a newline and the indentation
// after it is how the source was formatted and renders nothing. Upstream draws the line with
// `is_line_break`, which asks that the text both contain a newline and be entirely whitespace.
//
// Our parser has already made that exact distinction. `ast.IsWhitespaceOnlyJsxText` was measured
// against all three discriminating inputs and agrees with `is_line_break` on every one: `" "` is
// false, `"\n"` is true, and `"\n  x\n"` is false. So the predicate is asked rather than rebuilt.
//
// Only the *first* child is tested, which is upstream's `jsx.children[0]` and not a simplification
// of it. An element whose first child is a formatting newline and whose second is real text is
// therefore clean, which is a narrowness this port carries deliberately rather than improves on.
