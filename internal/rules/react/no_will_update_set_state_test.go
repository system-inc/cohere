// willUpdateSetStateFile is where the fixtures pretend to live.
//
// A `.tsx` name because upstream's corpus is written in JSX and one clean case returns JSX. Unlike
// oxc, this rule declares no file gate; see the note on the rule about `should_run`.
const willUpdateSetStateFile = "/repository/source/WillUpdate.tsx"

// The corpus is oxc's, copied rather than rewritten.
//
// Every upstream case below is verbatim from
// `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/no_will_update_set_state.rs`: 7 pass and 12 fail, from a
// single tester block. The extractor reported 12 diagnostics against those 12 fail inputs and the
// snapshot carries 12 location headers, so the mapping is one finding per input and no recovery by
// line alignment was needed. There is only one snapshot file for this rule, so the multi-snapshot
// discrepancy hazard the brief warns about could not arise; it was checked rather than assumed.
//
// The strings were decoded from the extractor's `-dump` output as JSON and then compared byte
// against byte into the Rust source by a script before any Go was written. All 19 matched, and a
// second script confirmed none of them contains a backslash or a quote, so the escape-cooking
// hazard that has bitten four previous porters could not arise here.
//
// The option column is the raw upstream spelling: "" for an absent option, and otherwise the single
// positional string upstream passes.
//
// # One upstream pass case is recorded here as reporting, deliberately
//
// Upstream's sixth pass case is an `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` under
// `settings.react.version = "16.2.0"`, and it is clean upstream only because that version predates
// the prefix. Our `internal/config` has no settings surface at all: `Config` carries `Rules` and
// `Overrides` and nothing else, so no react version can reach a rule here and oxc's own default
// branch, `is_none_or(supports_unsafe_lifecycle_prefix)`, is the only reachable one. Measured on the
// release binary rather than reasoned about: with no version configured that exact source reports,
// and with `"version": "16.2.0"` configured it is silent, in the same run against the same file.
// So the case is pinned as reporting, which is upstream's answer under the configuration we can
// actually produce, and the reasoning is here so the next reader does not delete the case or break
// the rule to green it.
