// Ported from `react/jsx-no-comment-textnodes` in `eslint-plugin-react`, read from the clone at
// `lib/rules/jsx-no-comment-textnodes.js`. No options (`schema: []`), one message, no fixer. Every
// behaviour below was measured by driving the installed build (7.37.5) through the ESLint Linter
// API rather than reasoned from the source.
//
// # There is no file-suffix gate
//
// Three siblings in this package gate on the file being read as JSX, inherited from oxc. This rule
// was ported from the authority, which has no such gate. Measured under `.tsx`, `.jsx` and `.js`:
// all three report. A `.ts` file cannot hold JSX at all, so there is no fourth row to measure and
// the gate would be unobservable rather than wrong.
//
// # The predicate is a regex over the RAW source, and both halves of that matter
//
// Upstream tests `/^\s*\/(\/|\*)/m` against `getText(context, node)`, which is the source slice
// rather than any cooked value. Two consequences, both measured:
//
//   - The `m` flag anchors `^` at every LINE start, not only at the node's start. So a comment on
//     the third line of a multi-line text node reports, and that is the shape the corpus's own
//     failing cases are written in. A port anchoring only at the node start passes the two
//     single-line cases and goes silent on four of the seven.
//
//   - Reading the raw source is what makes entity-escaped text clean. `<pre>&#x2F;&#x2F; TODO</pre>`
//     is silent because the raw slice holds the ampersand form, and upstream ships two such cases.
//     A port reading a decoded value would report both, and no fixture written from the corpus
//     could see the difference, because the corpus asserts them as clean either way.
//
// `\s*` allows leading whitespace, so an indented comment reports. Text with `//` anywhere other
// than after a line's leading whitespace is clean: `<div>hello // not a comment</div>` is silent,
// measured.
//
// # One finding per text node, not per comment line
//
// The regex is a test rather than a scan, so a text node holding three comment lines reports once.
// Measured: `<div>\n // one\n // two\n</div>` reports once, and the same two lines separated by an
// expression container report twice, because the container splits them into two text nodes. Neither
// shape is in the corpus and the difference is invisible to a fixture asserting one id per input.
//
// # Upstream also visits every string literal, and none of them can ever report
//
// The rule registers `Literal` alongside `JSXText` and filters on the parent's type: it must
// contain "JSX" and be neither a `JSXAttribute` nor a `JSXExpressionContainer`. A string literal's
// only JSX parents are exactly those two, so the filter excludes every literal it could see. Probed
// over both positions in this parser: an attribute value's parent is `KindJsxAttribute` and a
// braced string's is `KindJsxExpression`, matching upstream's two exclusions. Measured against the
// installed rule, `<div className="// nope" />` and `<div>{"// ok"}</div>` are both silent.
//
// So the literal listener is not registered here. That is a deliberate divergence in mechanism and
// none in decision, and it is stated rather than silent: reproducing a visit that can never report
// would cost a listener over every string in the tree to reach the same answer.
//
// # Where the finding points, and why this does not use ReportNode
//
// Upstream passes the text node itself, so the span is the whole text node including its leading
// and trailing whitespace, not the comment within it.
//
// `ctx.ReportNode` cannot express that here. It routes through `rule.TokenRange`, which calls
// `GetRangeOfTokenAtPosition` to skip leading trivia, and a JSX text node whose content IS a
// comment is exactly the input that breaks: the scanner reads `// invalid` as trivia and returns
// the position of the NEXT token, past the node's own end. Probed on
// `const a = <div>// invalid</div>;` the node spans 15 to 25 while `TokenRange` answers 33 to 25,
// an INVERTED range whose start is after its end. Slicing the source with it panics.
//
// This is a defect in `TokenRange` for this node kind rather than in this rule, and it is worth
// naming because the trivia-skipping it performs is correct and load-bearing everywhere else. It
// does not reach any shipped rule today: `no-unescaped-entities` is the only other rule anchored on
// `KindJsxText` and it reports a sub-range through `ReportRange`, so it never asks `TokenRange`
// about a text node at all. This rule takes the same route for the same reason, and the second span
// fixture below pins the whole-node span so a later switch to `ReportNode` fails loudly instead of
// panicking on one shape and passing on the rest.
//
// Trivia skipping is not wanted here in any case: upstream's span deliberately includes the
// surrounding whitespace, so the node's own range is the correct answer as well as the safe one.

// The `m` flag is the whole reason this walks lines: `^` matches at every line start, so a comment
// on any line of a multi-line text node reports. Four of upstream's seven failing cases depend on

		// JavaScript's `\s` additionally matches several non-ASCII spaces, and a text node
