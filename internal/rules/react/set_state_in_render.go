//
// Rendering is supposed to be a pure function of props and state. A setter called while that
// function runs schedules a second render, whose body calls the setter again, and React aborts the
// component with `Too many re-renders` after about fifty rounds. When the call is conditional the
// loop usually terminates, and upstream deliberately says nothing about that case: it costs a
// double render rather than hanging, and flagging it would report most legitimate
// derived-state-from-props code.
//
// # What this rule actually discriminates on, which is not what its name says
//
// The name reads as "a setter, during render", and both halves are narrower than the truth.
//
// It is not only render. A **hook** reports too, measured on React's own rule:
// `function useThing() { const [x, setX] = useState(0); setX(1); return x; }` reports. The subject
// is any function React would compile, which is components and hooks alike.
//
// And it is not the call's syntax. What decides it is the **type** of the value being called, and
// then whether the block holding the call runs on every path. Three inputs that look identical at
// the call site fall three different ways, all measured:
//
//	setX(1);                    reports    setX is a Dispatch
//	const a = setX; a(1);       reports    the alias carries the type
//	s[1](1);                    clean      reached through a property, never tracked
//
// # How a setter is identified here, and why no React knowledge is compiled in
//
// `@types/react` declares `useState<S>(): [S, Dispatch<SetStateAction<S>>]`. `Dispatch` is a **type
// alias** and the checker records it on the type, so the setter element of the tuple carries the
// alias `Dispatch` and the value element carries none. That single fact replaces upstream's entire
// mechanism, which is a seeded table naming `useState` plus 1,450 lines of unification to propagate
// a `BuiltInSetState` shape id out of it.
//
// The **alias** is the field, and the symbol is not. Probed on our own checker: a setter's type
// symbol is an anonymous type-literal whose `Name` is a non-printable internal marker, so a
// predicate keyed on the symbol name compares against binary noise. `useRef` is the mirror image,
// and the reason this is stated rather than left implicit: `RefObject` is an **interface**, so it
// lands in the type's `symbol` and its alias is correctly nil. A sibling rule reading refs must use
// the opposite field, and a predicate written for one of them silently reports nothing for the other.
//
// Three consequences, all probed rather than assumed:
//
//   - **A custom hook wrapping `useState` is followed for free.** `useCustomState` returning
//     `useState(init)` gives its caller a `Dispatch`, because the checker infers the return type
//     through the wrapper. Upstream needs `enableTreatSetIdentifiersAsStateSetters` and a name
//     heuristic to approximate this.
//   - **`useReducer` does not false-positive.** `dispatch` carries `ActionDispatch`, a different
//     alias.
//   - **A structurally identical function does not false-positive.** `const plain: (value: number)
//     => void` has a nil alias while `const declared: Dispatch<number>` has the alias, so the test
//     is nominal rather than structural. That is the negative control for this predicate, and it is
//     the reason the predicate is safe to apply to every call in the tree.
//
// The trade is stated plainly because it decides how this rule should be judged. This rule depends
// on `@types/react` resolving and on the setter having a real type. That is right for application
// code and wrong for a corpus: **nine of upstream's ten fixtures for this rule do not import
// React**, so `useState` is a bare undeclared global that resolves to nothing and the whole file is
// `any`. A pass-rate measured on those fixtures as written would be near zero while the rule is
// correct on everything Kirk actually writes. See the test file for how that is handled.
//
// # Why this needs the intermediate representation and the post-dominator tree
//
// Two of the three questions this rule asks cannot be answered from the syntax tree.
//
// **Does this call reach a setter** needs alias chains followed to any depth. `const a = setX;
// const b = a; b(1);` reports at `b`, and single-assignment form gives that for free through
// `LoadLocal` and `StoreLocal` propagation, which is what upstream does over the same shape.
//
// **Does this call happen on every path** is post-dominance and nothing else. The three loop
// fixtures are syntactically indistinguishable and fall differently:
//
//	for (const _ of props) {}                                    setState after: REPORTS
//	for (const _ of props) { if (c) break; else continue; }       setState after: REPORTS
//	for (const _ of props) { if (c) break; else throw new Error(); } setState after: REPORTS
//	for (const p of props) { setState(true); }                    setState inside: CLEAN
//
// and an early return before the call makes it clean while leaving the syntax around the call
// unchanged. `high_level_intermediate_representation.UnconditionalBlocks` is the port of upstream's `computeUnconditionalBlocks`; its
// file explains why forward dominance, which this tree already had in two places, answers the wrong
// question and would have reported the early-return case.
//
// This is therefore the opposite conclusion to `error-boundaries`, which read the same graph
// machinery and used none of it. That rule's question was "is B written inside A", which is about
// text. This one's is "must control reach B", which is about paths, and no parent walk answers it.
//
// # Two message ids from one validator
//
// Upstream's `validate_no_set_state_in_render` emits two diagnostics, and the branch order matters:
// the `useMemo` arm is checked BEFORE the unconditional test, so a setter called inside a `useMemo`
// reports even when the call is conditional within that callback. Measured, `useMemo(() => { if
// (props.c) { setX(1); } return 1; }, [])` reports.
//
// **`useCallback` does not report and `useMemo` does**, which is not a distinction anyone would
// guess and is not a judgment about memoization at all. Upstream replaces a `useMemo` callback with
// a **direct call** to it, so the callback's body is inlined into the render graph and its setState
// becomes a real instruction; a `useCallback` callback is replaced with a **LoadLocal**, so the
// function is only handed around and its body never runs during render. Read at
// `getManualMemoizationReplacement` in the shipped plugin, and confirmed by running both.
//
// Because our lowering never emits `StartMemoize` (that marker is inserted by a compiler pass this
// tree does not run, as `lower.go` states), the memoized region is recognized syntactically instead,
// the same way `use_memo.go` and `void_use_memo.go` already recognize one. Fidelity is owed to what
// the rule decides, not to how upstream obtains it.
//
// # Reproduced holes, each measured on React's own rule rather than inferred
//
//   - **An optional call is silent.** `setX?.(1)` reports nothing upstream. Reproduced by declining
//     `CallExpression.Optional`, rather than left as an accident of our lowering.
//   - **A setter reached through a property is silent.** `const s = useState(0); s[1](1);` and
//     `const o = {go: setX}; o.go(1);` both report nothing, because upstream tracks only
//     `LoadLocal` and `StoreLocal`. Our `MethodCall` and `ComputedLoad` are deliberately not
//     consulted.
//   - **A rest parameter silences its function.** `function Component(...props)` is not a component
//     to React's parameter test, so nothing in it reports. Checked with a control in the same file:
//     a second component beside it still reports, so this is a per-function decline rather than a
//     whole-file bailout.

//
// The return value says whether this function itself reported, which is the signal the caller uses

// `emit` separates reporting from detecting, and the separation is upstream's rather than an

// Upstream shares one arena across every function in a compilation, so an `IdentifierId` means the

// recursion. This IR gives each `Function` its OWN tables, which the package comment names as its
// main deliberate divergence, so the same integer denotes different values in a parent and a child.
// Passing the parent's map into the child asks about ids that happen to collide, which is not a
// milder version of the right question but an unrelated one.
//
// The correspondence that makes the translation exact is positional: `FunctionExpression.Captures`
// and `nested.Context` are the two ends of one edge list, in the same order. Probed on a function
// capturing two values, the parent side reads `[setX, props]` and the nested side reads
// `[setX, props]`, index for index.
//
// # Why the parent side is where the type question is asked
//
// A nested `Context` place has a nil `Identifier.Node`, because a capture is a value the callee
// receives rather than a syntactic occurrence inside it. There is nothing to hand the checker, so a
// setter read from that side answers false. The same capture read from `Captures`, which indexes the
