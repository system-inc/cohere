// # The authority, and which of two passes it is
//
// React's own `validateNoDerivedComputationsInEffects`, raising `ErrorCategory.EffectDerivationsOfState`,
// at `Validation/ValidateNoDerivedComputationsInEffects.ts`. That file has a sibling named
// `ValidateNoDerivedComputationsInEffects_exp.ts`, 842 lines against the base pass's 229, and
// choosing between them is the first decision this port makes.
//
// The shipped ESLint plugin runs the BASE pass. Measured in
// `node_modules/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/cjs/eslint-plugin-react-hooks.development.js`: its
// `COMPILER_OPTIONS.environment` sets `validateNoDerivedComputationsInEffects: true` and never sets
// the `_exp` flag, whose schema default is false. The pipeline prefers `_exp` when both are on, so
// the flag that is absent is the one that decides. This rule is the base pass.
//
// That matters more than it sounds, because the CORPUS is the other way round. All 21 fixtures in
// `__tests__/fixtures/compiler/effect-derived-computations/` carry
// `@validateNoDerivedComputationsInEffects_exp`, so their names describe the experimental pass's
// verdict and not the shipped one. Exactly one fixture in the whole 2,688-fixture tree carries the
// base pragma: `error.invalid-derived-computation-in-effect.js`. Every one of the 21 was run
// against the shipped rule before being written into the test file, and five of them invert:
// three named `-no-error` report, and the one named `invalid-derived-computation-in-effect` is
// clean. Trusting the names would have produced a rule whose fixtures and code shared one wrong
// belief, which is the failure the brief warns about; the fixture file records each measured
// verdict beside its case.
//
// # What the pass decides
//
// Upstream gathers three maps over the enclosing function, then judges each effect:
//
//	LoadLocal          value -> the value it read, so a dep written as a local resolves to its source
//	ArrayExpression    value -> the literal, so a dependency array can be recovered from an identifier
//	FunctionExpression value -> the function, so an effect callback can be recovered from an identifier
//
// A call is a candidate when its callee is an effect hook AND it has exactly two arguments AND both
// are plain identifiers. Both halves are load-bearing: `useEffect(cb)` with no dependency array is
// never a candidate, because this rule's whole judgment is "the callback computes nothing the deps
// did not already supply", which has no meaning without deps.
//
// Then `validateEffect` requires, in order:
//
//   - Every value the callback closes over is either a state setter or one of the deps. Capturing
//     anything else means the effect reads something outside the derivation and is left alone.
//   - Every dep is actually captured. An unused dep means the effect is not purely a function of them.
//   - No back edge. A block whose predecessor has not been seen yet is a loop, and the pass returns
//     rather than analysing it.
//   - Every instruction is one of a small allowed set. Anything else, including a store, an object
//     literal, or a JSX element, returns.
//   - No terminal reads a derived value. A derived value used in a branch condition or a return
//     means the effect does more than set state.
//
// Within that, a taint map carries dep-ness forward through loads, property reads, binary
// expressions, template literals and calls. A setter call reports only when its argument's taint
// set has exactly as many distinct deps as the effect declared, so setting from ONE of two deps is
// silent and setting from both reports. A setter call whose argument carries no taint at all
// abandons the whole effect rather than skipping that one call.
//
// # Two predicates that upstream answers from a shape registry and this rule answers from types
//
// `isUseEffectHookType` and `isSetStateType` both read `Identifier.type.shapeId`, a builtin shape
// the compiler seeds when it sees an import from the literal module `react`. This tree has no such
// registry, and the sibling rule `set-state-in-effect` already established the replacement: ask the
// checker. `effectHookKind` resolves a callee to the name it was DECLARED as, which is what makes a
// renamed import report and a same-named local stay silent, and `isSetterTyped` reads the `Dispatch`
// type ALIAS that `@types/react` puts on a `useState` setter and on nothing else. Both helpers are
// this package's and are reused rather than rewritten, which is the whole reason these two rules
// were batched.
//
// The measured consequence of the difference is stated rather than smoothed over: upstream is
// silent on `import {useEffect} from './react'` because the specifier is not `react`, and this rule
// reports. That was measured in both directions rather than reasoned about, by running the shipped
// rule over the corpus twice, once with the original specifier and once rewritten. Four of the five
// reporting fixtures went silent under the rewrite. It is the same trade `set-state-in-effect`
// documents: a dependency on `@types/react` instead of a shape registry, better on application code
// and worse against a corpus that omits its imports.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// At the setter's own reference inside the effect, which is `instr.value.callee.loc` upstream. Not
// at the effect, not at the dependency array, and not at the setter's binding in the `useState`
// destructure. Measured against React 7.1.1 on every reporting fixture and asserted by slicing the
// source with the finding's range, because a message id cannot see where a finding points and the
// three plausible anchors here all produce the same id.
//
// # What this rule deliberately does not do
//
// `enableTreatFunctionDepsAsConditional` and the `_exp` pass's data-flow tree are not ported. The
// `_exp` pass produces a much richer description naming the reactive sources and drawing a tree,
// and it is a different rule with a different verdict on a third of the corpus. When the shipped
// plugin switches to it this rule is a re-port rather than an adjustment, and the fixture file's
// recorded per-case verdicts are what will make that visible.

// the time upstream judges an effect, a `const lastName = 'Swift'` read inside the callback is a
// `Primitive` in the callback's own body rather than a capture. The dependency array still names
// `lastName`, so upstream's "every dep is actually captured" check fails and it abandons the effect.
// The silence is a side effect of the fold, not a rule anybody wrote down.
//
// Verify has no constant propagation, so our lowering keeps the capture and every one of those
// checks passes. Three of upstream's clean fixtures reported without this. The lowered form was
// printed rather than guessed at: the enclosing function holds `$23 = Primitive Swift` then
// `$24 = StoreLocal const lastName$25 = $23`, and the callback holds `$15 = LoadContext lastName$7`
// where upstream would hold a primitive.
//
// # The boundary was measured rather than assumed
//
// Driving React 7.1.1 on single-variable edits of one shape:
//
//	const lastName = 'Swift'   listed as a dep    silent
//	const n = 42               listed as a dep    silent
//	const n = 40 + 2           listed as a dep    silent    (upstream folds the arithmetic too)
//	const o = {x: 1}           listed as a dep    REPORTS   (an object is not a constant)
//	const lastName = compute() listed as a dep    REPORTS
//	const lastName = 'Swift'   NOT listed as a dep REPORTS  (folded on both sides, so no mismatch)
//
// The last row is why this declines the whole effect rather than dropping the dep from the list: a
// constant that is not named in the array changes nothing on either side, and a constant that IS
// named is precisely the mismatch that makes upstream give up.
//
// # What is deliberately not reproduced
//

// distinctCount is upstream's `new Set(deps).size`, and here it is EQUIVALENT to `len`, which is
// stated rather than left as a surviving mutant.
//
// Replacing the body with `len(identifiers)` survives the whole suite. That is not a fixture gap:
// no slice reaching this function can hold a repeat, because every writer of the taint map produces
// a duplicate-free slice. There are exactly five, and they were enumerated rather than assumed:
//
//	the capture seed          a one-element literal
//	the phi aggregate         built through identifiersOf, which iterates a SET
//	the two load arms         copy an existing slice, so they inherit the property
//	the operand aggregate     built through identifiersOf, same as the phi
//
// `identifiersOf` walks `effectDeps` and emits each entry at most once, and `effectDeps` itself
// carries one entry per element of the dependency array. So a repeat would need the same identifier
// written into the dependency array twice, which upstream's own `new Set` is what handles, and which
// our taint aggregate has already collapsed one step earlier.
//
// The reachability was probed rather than argued: six shapes that could plausibly produce a repeat
// were run against both versions, including a ternary with identical arms, a logical operator over
// one dep, and `a + a` in a single expression. Zero disagreements. The `a + a` case is the
// interesting one, since it reports under both versions, proving the path IS reached and the count
// still agrees.
//
// Upstream's spelling is kept because it is upstream's, and because the property above is a
// consequence of how this file happens to build its slices rather than something the type system
// enforces. A future writer that appends without deduplicating would make the difference real, and
// this comment is what tells them the guard is load-bearing again at that point.
