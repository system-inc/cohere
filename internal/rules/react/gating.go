// GatingOptions is the decoded option object.
//
// # Why this option exists, and why its default is not upstream's
//
// React gates the entire check behind its `dynamicGating` compiler option, which defaults to
// `null`: `findDirectivesDynamicGating` returns `Ok(null)` before looking at a single directive
// when the option is unset (bundle line 50510). oxc's driver does the same at
// `program.rs:141-144`. Both are correct for a compiler, which needs the option's `source` field to
// know which module to import the condition from and has nothing to do until it is given one.
//
// A linter has no such dependency. Neither diagnostic reads `source`: one asks whether a string is
// an identifier, the other counts directives. Porting the gate literally would register a rule that
// cannot produce a finding under any configuration verify can express, since verify has no React
// Compiler config surface to set `dynamicGating` from. That is the inert-rule failure the port
// brief names: it would pass every fixture, lint every file, and be structurally incapable of
// reporting.
//
// So the gate is exposed as an option and inverted to default on. What the rule *decides* about any
// given directive is unchanged from both upstreams; only the precondition for looking moves, which
// is the "fidelity is to what the rule decides, not how it obtains what it needs" rule in the port
// brief. Set `requireDynamicGatingOption` to true to reproduce upstream's silence exactly.
//
// Recorded as a divergence rather than smoothed over: a differential run against a tool that
// implements upstream's gate will show findings here that it does not report, and the reason is
// this default rather than a disagreement about any directive.

	// RequireDynamicGatingOption restores upstream's precondition, making the rule silent.

	// Named for the upstream option it stands in for rather than for its effect here, so a reader
	// who knows React Compiler's config recognizes what is being asked. Defaults to false, which is

	// is no evidence either way, and the parity guard never reads that field.

// sites that agree with each other:
//
//	react 7.1.1   node_modules/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/cjs/eslint-plugin-react-hooks.development.js
//	              `findDirectivesDynamicGating` at line 50508, unminified
//	oxc compiler  crates/oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler/entrypoint/program.rs:137-189
//	              a second implementation of the same function, driver-only
//
// Scored against React's own goldens under `fixtures/compiler/gating/`, never against an oxc
// snapshot, since no oxc snapshot for this rule exists.
//
// # The directive grammar, stated exactly
//
// React's production is one regular expression, `^use memo if\(([^)]*)\)$` (bundle line 50486), and
// oxc's hand-rolled parser is written to match it character for character. Read carefully it says
// four things, and three of them are easy to get wrong:
//
//   - The prefix is exactly `use memo if(`. One space either side of `memo`, no leeway. `use memo
//     if (x)` with a space before the paren does not match, and neither does `useMemo if(x)`.
//   - The condition is `[^)]*`, so it may be **empty** and may not contain a close paren. `'use
//     memo if()'` matches with an empty condition, which is then not an identifier, so it reports.
//   - The `$` anchor means the directive ends at the close paren. Trailing anything, including a
//     space, fails the match.
//   - A string that fails the match entirely is **not this rule's business**. It is some other
//     directive, or a stray string expression, and it is silent. Only a string that parses as a
//     gating directive and then carries a bad condition reports.
//
// That last point is the shape of the whole rule: matching the grammar is what makes a string
// eligible for judgment, and the judgment is only ever about the condition inside the parens.
//
// # What counts as a valid condition
//
// React calls Babel's `isValidIdentifier`, which is `!isKeyword(name) && !isStrictReservedWord(name,
// true) && isIdentifierName(name)` (bundle line 4769). oxc calls `is_identifier_name(s) &&
// !is_reserved_keyword(s)`. Those two reserved-word sets were extracted and compared element by
// element and they are **identical**, forty-six words, with no member on either side the other
// lacks. So the two authorities agree completely here and there is nothing to choose between.
//
// The set is written out in `gatingReservedWords` below rather than asked of the shim, and that is
// a measurement rather than a preference. See the note there.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// React reports `directive.loc`, which is Babel's Directive node and **includes the semicolon**.
// oxc reports `directive.expression.span`, the string literal alone, excluding it. That is a real
// divergence between the two implementations and React wins as the authority.
//
// It did not have to be argued from the source, because React's golden states byte offsets.
// `dynamic-gating-invalid-multiple.expect.md` logs the finding at `index: 105` through `index: 128`,
// and slicing that fixture's own bytes at those offsets yields `'use memo if(getTrue)';`, twenty
// three bytes with the semicolon on the end. Reporting the ExpressionStatement through
// `ctx.ReportNode` reproduces `105..128` exactly, verified against that source before this rule was
// written. The span is asserted in the fixtures, because a message-id assertion cannot see it.
//
// # Which directive the duplicate finding points at
//
// One finding for the whole function, not one per extra directive, and it points at the **first**
// one: React pushes a single error with `loc: result[0].directive.loc`. Its golden confirms the
// choice, logging `line 4` for a file whose second directive is on line 5. oxc labels every
// directive instead, primary on the first and secondary on the rest, but that is one diagnostic
// with several labels rather than several diagnostics, so the two agree on the count.
//
// The message names every offending directive in source order, which is why it interpolates.
//
// # Invalid outranks duplicate
//
// Both implementations collect invalid-identifier errors across the whole body first and return
// them if any exist, reaching the duplicate check only when every matched directive was valid. So
// a body carrying two directives that are *both* malformed reports twice with the invalid message
// and never reports the duplicate one. Reproduced, and pinned by a fixture, because it is invisible
// from either message alone.
//
// # What a directive is, and why the shim's own predicate could not be used
//
// A directive here is a string-literal expression statement in the **leading run** of a function
// body or the source file, which is the ECMAScript directive prologue and what Babel puts in
// `body.directives`. The run ends at the first statement that is anything else.
//
// `ast.IsPrologueDirective` is linknamed into the shim and looks like exactly this predicate. It is
// not. Probed directly before this rule was written: it answers **true** for a string expression
// statement sitting after a `const` declaration, so it is a kind test with a prologue-shaped name
// and no position component at all. Believing it would have reported a mid-body string that neither
// authority considers a directive. The leading run is therefore walked here, and a fixture pins the
// after-a-statement case as silent.
//
// Three further shapes were probed on our parser rather than assumed, and all three land the way
// both authorities need:
//
//	`use memo if(a)`      KindNoSubstitutionTemplateLiteral, not a directive anywhere. Silent.
//	('use memo if(a)')    KindParenthesizedExpression, not a directive anywhere. Silent.
//	"use memo if(a)"      double quotes are a directive. Reports, same as single.
//
// # Escapes are cooked, and that is correct rather than convenient
//
// `'use memo if(a)'` arrives with `.Text` already `"use memo if(a)"`, and it reports as valid.
// That matches upstream rather than diverging from it: React matches its regex against
// `directive.value.value`, which is Babel's cooked value, and interpolates the same cooked value
// into the message. So the finding text prints the cooked form on both sides. This is the one place
// where the port brief's warning about cooked-versus-raw text resolves in favor of cooked.

// ordinary identifiers to Babel. A gating condition named `type` or `async` is entirely legal and a
