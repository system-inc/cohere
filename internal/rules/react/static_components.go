// A component created during render has a new identity on every render, so React unmounts the old
// one and mounts the new one instead of updating it. All of its state is discarded and its entire
// subtree re-renders, every time. The symptom is an input that loses what was typed in it, which
// reads as a state-management bug and is caused by the component's definition sitting inside the
// render rather than beside it.
//
// # Where this comes from
//
// React's own `ValidateStaticComponents.ts`, transcribed by oxc at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_validation/validate_static_components.rs`, which is the
// version this follows. oxc's *linter* rule at `rules/react/static_components.rs` is a dispatcher:
// its whole body is `run_react_compiler_rule(ctx, ErrorCategory::StaticComponents)`. Twenty two of
// oxc's react rules share that body, so a grep for `run_react_compiler_rule` identifies the family
// at once; the judgment for every one of them lives in the compiler crate rather than in the rule
// file, and reading only the rule file makes a large port look like a ninety line one.
//
// # Why this is the first rule here built on the intermediate representation
//
// The decision is not syntactic and cannot be made syntactic. Three of the six upstream fixtures
// need a value to be followed across assignments, and one needs taint merged where two branches
// join. `let C; if (cond) { C = createComponent(); } else { C = Default; } return <C />;` reports,
// and it reports because the component is dynamic on *one* path. That is a phi node. Answering it
// from the syntax tree means re-deriving evaluation order and control flow per rule, which is the
// duplication `internal/utilities/hir` exists to end.
//
// So this lowers each function-like node, builds single-assignment form, and runs upstream's own
// algorithm over the result: a map from value to the span that made it dynamic, propagated forward
// through loads, stores and phis, consulted at every JSX tag. The transcription is close to
// line-for-line because the instruction set was deliberately built to upstream's shape, and that
// fidelity is what lets a disagreement be read as a defect rather than as a design difference.
//
// # Three behaviours that look wrong and are upstream's, verified by running it
//
// Each of these was measured against the release `oxlint` binary on the input named, because
// reading produced the wrong guess first in two of the three cases.
//
//   - **No component-name test anywhere.** The rule never asks whether a tag looks like a
//     component. `const Ábc = makeIt(); <Ábc />` reports; a lowercase binding used as a plain tag
//     reports too. What decides it is whether the tag is a value at all rather than a literal
//     element name, which the representation answers directly through `JsxTag.Place`. Neither
//     `react.IsLikelyComponentName` nor `react.EnclosingComponent` is consulted, and reaching for
//     one here would be a plausible-looking divergence.
//
//   - **A member-expression tag never reports**, however dynamic its base. `<c.x />`,
//     `<obj.Inner.Deep />` and `<T.x.y />` are all silent upstream. Such a tag is not a `Place`, so
//     no taint can attach to it. This is a real hole in the analysis rather than a considered
//     exemption, and it is reproduced rather than improved on.
//
//   - **A back edge is invisible.** `let C = Known; for (...) { C = makeIt(); } return <C />;` does
//     NOT report, while moving the dynamic assignment above the loop does. The pass walks blocks
//     once in reverse postorder, so taint arriving on an edge from a block it has already visited
//     is never seen. This looked like a defect in our lowering; the representation turned out to
//     place the loop phi correctly with its back edge, and running upstream showed identical
//     behaviour. Faithful, not broken, and recorded here so it is not helpfully repaired into a
//     divergence.
//
// # A JSX tag inside a nested function never reports, and the reason changed under this rule
//
// `const C = makeIt(); const render = () => <C />;` is silent, and upstream is silent on it too,
// measured on the exact input. The mechanism is the compilation gate below: the tag lives in a
// function that is not a unit, and the function that IS a unit does not contain the tag.
//
// This comment previously said the silence came from `FunctionExpression.Captures` being empty, so
// taint could not cross a function boundary at all. That was true when this rule was written and
// stopped being true one commit later, when lowering learned to resolve a closed-over variable to
// the binding it captures. Captures now populate and `LoadContext` is emitted. The BEHAVIOUR did
// not change and neither did the agreement with upstream; only the reason did. It is corrected
// here rather than left, because a stale reason is worse than no reason: the next reader would
// have gone looking for a substrate gap that no longer exists.
//
// Taint deliberately still does not follow a capture. Nothing in the corpus asks it to, upstream
// does not do it, and a rule-local approximation would make the two implementations agree on the
// cases both already handle while disagreeing about why.
//
// # One span where upstream has two
//
// Upstream reports at the JSX tag and attaches a secondary label at the creation site. Our
// `Diagnostic` carries a single `Range`, so the primary span is kept where upstream puts it and the
// creation site moves into the message text. No information is dropped, but a reader comparing
// against React's goldens should know the shape differs deliberately.

// analyzeCompiledFunction runs the pass over the functions upstream would have compiled.
//
// # Why this gate exists, and what it cost to find
//
// The React Compiler does not analyse every function. `getReactFunctionType` in its `Program.ts`,
// transcribed by oxc at `react_compiler/entrypoint/program.rs`, admits a function only when its
// name looks like a component or a hook AND its body actually creates JSX or calls a hook. Anything
// else is never a compilation unit, so the validator never runs over it; when such a function is
// nested inside one that IS compiled, its body is analysed as part of the parent rather than on its
// own terms.
//
// Without this gate the rule analysed every function-like node in the file, and the difference is
// not theoretical. A dry run over 3,407 files produced seven findings, and ALL SEVEN were the same
// shape: a render callback defined inside a component, of the form
//
//	function Widget() {
//	  const render = function (item) { const Icon = iconFor(item); return <Icon />; };
//	  return <div>{render(x)}</div>;
//	}
//
// Upstream reports none of them, measured by bisecting a real file down to that shape. Every one
// would have been a false positive on Kirk's tree, and the fixture corpus could not have caught a
// single one, because upstream's six invalid cases all put the creation directly in the component
// where both implementations agree.
//
// # The intuitive reading is the wrong one, so it is recorded here
//
// These seven look like true positives, and by the rule's stated purpose they arguably are: a
// component built inside a callback that runs during render does get a fresh identity. That reading
// is what makes this divergence dangerous rather than obvious. Fidelity is the authority here, the
// gate is upstream's, and improving on it silently would make our findings and oxc's disagree on
