// Ported from `react/no-did-mount-set-state`, read against oxc's `no_did_mount_set_state.rs` and
// the shared walk it delegates to at `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/utils/react.rs:606`,
// `function_count_before_lifecycle_component`. There is no `eslint-plugin-react` source in this
// tree to read as a second opinion, so oxc is the sole authority and the corpus is the only check
// on it.
//
// # The whole rule is one question, and it is not the one the name asks
//
// The name reads as "is this `setState` inside `componentDidMount`", and answering that question is
// how a port gets this wrong. Upstream asks a *counted* version of it: walking outward from the
// call, how many function scopes are crossed before reaching the property that names
// `componentDidMount`. One means the call is written directly in the lifecycle body, and reports.
// More than one means the call is inside a callback or a nested function declaration, and is
// silent unless the option asks for it.
//
// That count is why the boundary cannot be guessed. Five separate passing cases upstream ships are
// a `setState` genuinely lexically inside `componentDidMount` -- an event callback, a nested
// function declaration, an arrow passed to `this.handleEvent`, a `setTimeout` arrow, and a promise
// `.then` arrow -- and every one of them is clean by default. A port implementing "inside
// componentDidMount" reports all five. Meanwhile the fail corpus includes a `setState` inside an
// `if` block and one inside the consequent of a conditional expression, which are *not* function
// scopes and therefore still count as one. So the boundary is function scopes crossed and nothing
// else: blocks, conditionals, loops and try bodies are all transparent to it.
//
// The counting also has to stop. Once the lifecycle property is found the walk stops counting but
// keeps climbing, because the count must not pick up the `render: function() {}` sibling or the
// arrow a whole component is assigned to. Upstream spells that as an `in_lifecycle` latch and this
// reproduces it.
//
// # Three ways to write the lifecycle method, and our AST splits them differently
//
// oxc matches three node kinds by static key name, which map onto four of ours. The mapping was
// taken from `no_is_mounted.go` in this package, which measured the same correspondence against
// oxlint for its own ancestor set, and then extended by one kind that rule deliberately excludes:
//
//	oxc ObjectProperty      -> KindPropertyAssignment     { componentDidMount: function() {} }
//	                        -> KindMethodDeclaration      { componentDidMount() {} }  (shared)
//	oxc MethodDefinition    -> KindMethodDeclaration      class { componentDidMount() {} }
//	oxc PropertyDefinition  -> KindPropertyDeclaration    class { componentDidMount = () => {} }
//
// `KindPropertyDeclaration` is the one that differs from the neighbouring rule and it is not a
// judgment call here: oxc's `is_lifecycle_component_method` lists `PropertyDefinition` explicitly,
// and upstream ships `componentDidMount = () => {}` as a *failing* case. `no-is-mounted` excludes
// the same kind because oxc's match there omits it. Two rules in one package, opposite answers,
// both correct, and each one only checkable at its own reference.
//
// Accessors are absent from all of this, matching oxc: `get componentDidMount() {}` is neither an
// `ObjectProperty` nor a `MethodDefinition` in its tree, and nothing in the corpus writes one.
//
// # The component gate is load-bearing and is what the walk returns nothing for
//
// The walk climbs past the lifecycle method until it finds a component, and answers nothing if it
// reaches the top of the file without one. Upstream pins this with `function Hello() {
// this.setState({ data: 123 }); }`, which is a plain function containing exactly the call this rule
// is about and is clean. So a `componentDidMount` written on an ordinary object at the top level of
// a file reports nothing, which is the same syntactic-versus-component distinction `no-is-mounted`
// resolves in the opposite direction. This rule really does ask about components.
//
// But it asks a *looser* question than it looks, and this was measured on the release binary rather
// than reasoned about. Nothing checks that the lifecycle property is a member OF the component: the
// walk only requires that some ancestor further out is one. So a plain object literal carrying a
// `componentDidMount`, declared inside the render method of a real component, reports. That is
// upstream being loose rather than upstream being right, and it is reproduced rather than improved
// on, because a differential run against oxlint is what this port has to survive.
//
// The factory-name set is narrower than the shelf helper this rule calls. See
// `isEs5ComponentCallStrict` below: oxc accepts only `createReactClass` and
// `React.createReactClass`, while `internal/utils/react` also accepts `createClass`. Following the
// shelf would report on clean upstream code.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// oxc reports `call_expr.callee.span()`, not the call. For `this.setState({ data: 1 })` that is
// thirteen characters ending before the open parenthesis, which the snapshot confirms by underlining
// exactly `this.setState`. The neighbouring `no-is-mounted` reports its whole call including the
// parentheses, so the two rules in this package genuinely differ here and a message-id assertion
// cannot see it. Every fixture below asserts the sliced text.
var NoDidMountSetState = rule.Rule{
	// No namespace prefix. The config writes `react/no-did-mount-set-state` and the parity guard

// functionCountBeforeLifecycleMethod counts function scopes crossed on the way out to a named

// This is oxc's `function_count_before_lifecycle_component` at our AST's spelling
// (`oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/utils/react.rs:606`). The two-value return replaces its `Option<usize>`:
// the boolean is `Some` versus `None`, which is to say whether a component was ever reached, and the
// count is meaningless when it is false.
//
// The walk has three phases running in one pass, and the latch between the first two is the part a
// reimplementation drops:
//
//	before the lifecycle method   every function-like ancestor increments the count
//	after it                      counting stops, climbing continues
//	at a component                answer
//
// Without the latch the count picks up whatever function the component itself is written inside,
// which for `var Hello = createReactClass({...})` is none but for a component defined inside a
// factory or a module wrapper is one or more, and every direct `setState` in such a file would fall
// out of the report as though it were nested.
//
// The count starts at the call's parent rather than the call, matching upstream's `.skip(1)`. A
// call expression is not function-like so the skip changes nothing here, and it is kept because
// upstream's is load-bearing for the shape rather than for this rule.
//
// # Where our AST loses a count that oxc has, which is the whole reason this function exists
//
// oxc's `MethodDefinition` is a wrapper whose `value` is a separate `Function` node
// (`oxc_ast/src/ast/js.rs:2247`), so a class method contributes TWO ancestors to its walk and the
// inner one is function-like. Our `KindMethodDeclaration` is a single node carrying its own body,
// so the same source contributes one ancestor and it is not in the counted set. Measured rather
// than reasoned, by logging every ancestor kind of `this.setState` in each of the four shapes the
// corpus writes:
//
//	class { componentDidMount() { HERE } }       oxc 1, naive walk here 0
//	class { componentDidMount = () => { HERE } } oxc 1, naive walk here 1   (the arrow is real)
//	createReactClass({ m: function() { HERE } }) oxc 1, naive walk here 1   (the expression is real)
//	the same, one callback deeper                oxc 2, naive walk here 2
//
// So only the class-method row is short, and it is short by exactly one. Left uncorrected the
// numbers are off by one for the entire ES6 half of the rule: a direct `setState` in a class
// method counts 0 and still reports, so the imported failing cases all pass, while an arrow inside
// that method counts 1 and reports too. That is upstream's two clean cases
// "setState inside an arrow passed to a method" and "setState inside a promise then arrow"
// reported as violations, which is what the first run of this port did.
//
// The correction is applied where the latch is set, because that is the only place the missing
// node's identity is known: the lifecycle property has just been recognized and its kind says
// whether it was the function as well as the name. A property assignment and a property
// declaration are not corrected, because in those shapes the function is a real separate node the
