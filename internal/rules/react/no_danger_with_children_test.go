// A `.tsx` name because most of the corpus is JSX and would not parse otherwise. Unlike
// `no-string-refs`, this rule has no JSX-file gate: the `createElement` half of it decides about
// ordinary call expressions and would be just as correct in a `.ts` file.

// The corpus is oxc's, copied rather than rewritten.
//
// Every case below is verbatim from
// `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/no_danger_with_children.rs`: 17 pass and 14 fail from a
// single tester block. The snapshot carries 14 diagnostics against those 14 failing inputs, so it
// is one finding per input and there was no per-input count to recover.
//
// The strings were emitted by the extractor's own dumper rather than transcribed, and then checked
// back against the Rust source byte for byte by a script that searched for each one as both a raw
// string literal and an escaped one. All 31 matched. That check is not decoration: three porters
// before this one shipped a fixture the tool writing it had silently cooked, and reading them does
// not catch it.

// TestNoDangerWithChildrenFires covers every failing input upstream ships.
//
// The pattern in the list is worth naming because it looks like duplication and is not: nearly
// every case appears twice, once against `div` and once against `Hello`. The rule is deliberately
// indifferent to whether the tag is a host element or a component, and that indifference is
// upstream's, so dropping either half of each pair would leave it untested.
