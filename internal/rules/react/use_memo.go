//	              and .../react_compiler_validation/, a Rust transcription of the same functions
//
// Every behavioral claim below was established by **running** React's rule through the ESLint Linter
// API on the input named, over roughly a hundred and ten probe inputs, rather than by reading. That
// distinction earns its place: reading produced a confidently wrong answer twice, both recorded.
//
// # Where the answer lives, and why this does not use the intermediate representation
//
// This rule was written after `internal/utilities/hir` landed, and it is the kind of rule that package
// exists for: upstream's seven diagnostic constructors sit in `dropManualMemoization`, an
// optimization pass, and in `validateUseMemo`, a validator, and both read an instruction stream
// rather than syntax. The obvious move was to lower and transcribe.
//
// **It was probed rather than assumed, and the probe said no.** Lowering
// `function Widget(props) { const x = useMemo(props.fn, [props.a]); return x; }` produces an
// instruction stream that is a name-for-name match with upstream's shapes, exactly as the package
// comment promises:
//
//	$13 = LoadGlobal useMemo
//	$15 = PropertyLoad $14.fn
//	$18 = Array [$17]
//	$19 = Call $13($15, $18)
//
// `collectTemporaries` switches on `LoadGlobal`, `PropertyLoad`, `FunctionExpression` and
// `ArrayExpression`, and all four exist here under those names. `Function.Kind` already carries the
// component-or-hook guess, and `FunctionExpression` reaches a nested `Function` carrying `IsAsync`,
// `IsGenerator` and `Params`, which is three of the seven diagnostics answered directly.
//
// **The obstruction is the one thing this rule needs most.** Upstream's entire callee test is
// `getGlobalDeclaration(value.binding)`, which switches on the binding's kind: a true global, a
// module-local, a named import, a default import, a namespace import. Our `LoadGlobal` declares that
// field as `BindingKind GlobalBindingKind` with five variants, and **lowering never sets it to
// anything but `GlobalBindingKindGlobal`**. Probed directly: `import {useMemo} from 'react'` and a
// bare undeclared `useMemo` both lower to `LoadGlobal name="useMemo" bindingKind=0 source="" imported=""`,
// which is indistinguishable. `internal/utilities/hir/lower.go:61` says so in its own words, and adds
// that `FunctionExpression.Captures` is always empty and that this "is the largest single gap and it
// matters most to the memoization rules". This is one of those rules.
//
// So the intermediate representation would have supplied the shape of the answer while withholding
// the discrimination, and the discrimination is not decoration: the callee test decides whether the
// rule looks at a call at all, and getting it wrong is the difference between reporting every
// `useMemo` in the tree and reporting none. Whatever answered it would have to walk the syntax tree
// to the import declaration regardless, at which point the lowering is a second representation
// carried alongside the first for no remaining question.
//
// The question this rule actually asks is **what is written at this call site**: is the callee that
// name, is the first argument a function written here, is the second an array literal here, does
// this callback declare a parameter, is it async. Those are properties of text. The one question
// with any depth, whether a write inside the callback targets a binding declared outside it, is a
// scope question the checker answers directly through symbol identity. None of them is a question
// about paths, so none of them wants a control-flow graph. This is `error-boundaries`'s finding
// arriving a second time in the same package: a syntactic property wearing a compiler-pass costume,
// and the costume is upstream's because upstream had no syntax tree left by the time it looked.
//
// **What would genuinely change the verdict**, stated so the next reader can check rather than
// re-derive: populating `LoadGlobal.BindingKind`, `Source` and `Imported` during lowering. Those
// three fields already exist and are already documented; only the assignment is missing. With them
// set, transcribing `collectTemporaries` becomes strictly better than this rule's callee walk,
// because it would answer the same question with upstream's own code shape. Until then this rule
// would be carrying a lowering to obtain nothing it does not already have.
//
// # Whether `dropManualMemoization`'s judgment is required, which is the question the dispatch asked
//
// Four of the seven constructors live in `dropManualMemoization` and `extractManualMemoizationArgs`,
// and it is an optimization pass rather than a validator, so the question is fair. The answer is no,
// and it is worth being precise about why, because "the diagnostics are in an optimization pass"
// sounds like it should mean something.
//
// That pass does two separable things. It **rewrites** the call, replacing `useMemo(fn, deps)` with
// a plain `fn()` and threading `StartMemoize`/`FinishMemoize` markers around it so later passes can
// check the memoization was preserved. And on the way through it **complains** about argument shapes
// it could not make sense of. Only the second half constructs `ErrorCategory.UseMemo`, and every one
// of those four constructors fires on a syntactic property of the argument list, before the rewrite
// it guards has happened. Nothing downstream of the rewrite feeds back into them. So what is needed
// here is the pass's **complaint**, which is local, and not its **judgment**, which is about what the
// instruction stream should become.
//
// The one place that reads as an exception is the fourth constructor, "Expected the first argument to
// be an inline function expression", which upstream guards behind `isValidationEnabled`, a disjunction
// of three compiler config flags. That gate is a compiler concern: the diagnostic exists to protect
// the memoization-preservation checks that only run when those flags are on. Measured, the ESLint rule
// reports it unconditionally, because the plugin turns those flags on. Reproduced as unconditional.
//
// # The seven diagnostics, stated precisely
//
// Seven, not six. The dispatch that sent me here said six, and grepping `category: ErrorCategory.UseMemo`
// across the bundle finds seven constructors, at lines 42537, 42564, 42580, 42634, 46048, 46060 and
// 46123. All seven are reachable through the ESLint rule and all seven are ported. `VoidUseMemo` is a
// separate category with its own rule name, `void-use-memo`, and is a sibling's port rather than part
// of this one.
//
//	missing callback     `useMemo()` with no arguments at all. Points at the whole call.
//	not inline           the first argument is not a function written at the call site. A name, a
//	                     member access, a literal, a local variable holding a function: all report.
//	                     Points at the first argument.
//	deps not a literal   a second argument that is not an array literal written at the call site.
//	                     Points at the second argument.
//	dep not simple       an element of that array that is not a name or a static property chain off
//	                     one. Points at the element, and reports once per bad element.
//	callback parameters  the inline callback declares at least one parameter. Points at the first
//	                     parameter.
//	async or generator   the inline callback is `async` or a generator. Points at the whole callback.
//	reassigns outer      an assignment inside the inline callback whose target is a binding declared
//	                     outside it. Points at the assignment target.
//
// The first four are shared with `useCallback`; the last three are `useMemo` only. Measured:
// `useCallback((c) => c, [])` and `useCallback(async () => 1, [])` are both silent, while
// `useCallback(props.fn, [])` reports. That asymmetry is upstream's, because `validateUseMemo` keys
// on `useMemos` alone while `dropManualMemoization` keys on both.
//
// # Which callee counts, which is the whole gate on the call
//
// Upstream's `collectTemporaries` accepts two shapes, and both resolve the binding rather than
// matching text. Measured over a thirteen-input matrix holding the body byte-identical:
//
//	useMemo(...)                  reports, when `useMemo` resolves to no local declaration
//	import {useMemo} from 'react' reports
//	import {useMemo as um}, um()  reports  (keyed on the IMPORTED name, not the local one)
//	import {somethingElse as useMemo} from 'react'   silent  (imported name is not `useMemo`)
//	import {useMemo} from 'not-react'                silent  (module is not a React module)
//	const useMemo = ...           silent  (a local declaration shadows it, at either scope)
//	React.useMemo(...)            reports, when `React` resolves to no local declaration
//	import React from 'react'     reports  (keyed on the LOCAL name being `React`)
//	import * as React from 'react'  reports
//	import Rct from 'react', Rct.useMemo()   silent  (local name is not `React`)
//	import React from 'preact/compat'        reports (the receiver has NO module test; see below)
//	Foo.useMemo(...)              silent
//	const React = {useMemo}       silent
//
// The asymmetry between the two import forms is upstream's and is visible in `getGlobalDeclaration`:
// the `ImportSpecifier` arm looks up `binding.imported` while the `ImportDefault` and
// `ImportNamespace` arms look up `binding.name`. A React module is `react` or `react-dom`,
// lowercased, which `isKnownReactModule` in this package already answers and which oxc's
// `is_known_react_module` matches exactly.
//
// **The module test applies to the CALLEE only, never to the receiver**, which is not symmetric and
// is easy to get backwards. The receiver is recognized in `collectTemporaries` by a bare
// `binding.name === 'React'` with no module component at all, so `import React from 'preact/compat'`
// followed by `React.useMemo(...)` reports. That was measured after a surviving mutant contradicted
// the first version of this port, which had the check in both places; see `reactModuleLocalName`.
//
// This is the one place the checker is needed, and only for the negative half: to tell an
// undeclared `useMemo` from one shadowed by a local. `GetSymbolAtLocation` returning a symbol whose
// declarations are all in this file is the shadow case.
//
// # The component gate, and why it is most of the rule
//
// React Compiler compiles components and hooks, nothing else, so none of these seven fires outside
// one. Measured, holding the call byte-identical and varying only the enclosing function:
// `function widget(props)` is silent, `function Component(props)` reports, `function usething` is
// silent, `function useThing` reports, module scope is silent, `function Component(...props)` is
// silent, `function Component(props, other)` is silent, `function Component(props, ref)` reports.
//
// That gate is exactly `unsupported-syntax`'s `isInsideComponentOrHook`, already in this package and
// measured there over seventeen probe rounds, so it is reused rather than rewritten. One difference
// from `error-boundaries` was measured rather than inherited: a `Component` declared **inside**
// another function **does** report here, where `error-boundaries` measured its equivalent silent.
// `isInsideComponentOrHook` already answers that correctly, since a nested function reachable through
// a component-or-hook-named ancestor stays a root candidate.
//
// # Two readings that were wrong, recorded because the next reader will make them
//
// **The imports.** An early probe round concluded that any import of `useMemo` is silent and that
// oxc, which explicitly handles `ImportSpecifier`, therefore diverges from React. That was going to
// be shipped as a recorded divergence. It was false: the inputs that measured silent imported from
// `'not-react'`, and the conclusion was drawn across two probe batches that also differed in the
// enclosing function's name. Re-run as one controlled matrix varying only the import, React and oxc
// agree completely. This is the port brief's "a zero is three different things" arriving through a
// changed control rather than a bad pattern, and the only reason it was caught is that the second
// batch contradicted the first.
//
// **The rest parameter.** `useMemo((...a) => a, [props.a])` is silent, and so is
// `useMemo((b, ...a) => b, [props.a])`, while `useMemo((b) => b, [props.a])` reports. Reading
// upstream says this should report: `lowerParams` pushes a `Spread` place for a rest element, so
// `params.length > 0` holds. Probed further, a rest parameter **anywhere in the component or in any
// function nested in it** silences the whole function for this rule, including calls that have
// nothing to do with the callback carrying it: with `const bad = useMemo(props.fn, [props.a])` held
// fixed, adding an unrelated `const helper = (...a) => a;` to the same component makes `bad` stop
// reporting, and the control without the helper reports. Running every `react-hooks` rule over those
// inputs shows no Todo and no other diagnostic, so it is a silent whole-function bailout somewhere
// in the compiler rather than a judgment about the call.
//
// **That is not reproduced**, and the choice is deliberate rather than an omission. It is not a
// property of the call under judgment, it has no user-visible explanation upstream, and reproducing
// it would mean going silent on correct findings because of an unrelated function elsewhere in the
// file. Recorded as a real divergence: a differential against React's own rule will show findings
// here that it does not report, on files containing a rest parameter, and `restParameterElsewhere`
// in the fixtures pins that case as reporting with the reasoning at the line.
//
// # Where the findings point
//
// Every span below was measured by slicing the probe input's own bytes at the offsets React's rule
// reported, and every one is asserted in the fixtures, because a message-id assertion cannot see a
// span. The whole-call span for the no-arguments case, the callback span for async and generator,
// the first-parameter span for parameters, and the assignment-target span for a reassignment are
// four different anchors in one rule, and nothing but a span assertion separates them.
var UseMemo = rule.Rule{
	// No namespace prefix. The config writes `react/use-memo`, and the parity guard strips the
