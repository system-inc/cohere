	Id:          "noSetState",
	Description: "Do not use setState",
}

// NoSetState reports every `this.setState(...)` call written inside a React component.
//
//	valid:   this.setState({}) inside a plain function that is not a component
//	valid:   this.setState({}) inside a class with no React heritage
//	valid:   this.someHandler = this.setState, a reference rather than a call
//	invalid: this.setState({}) inside a class extending React.Component
//	invalid: this.setState({}) inside a createReactClass method
//
// The rule exists for codebases keeping component state somewhere else, a store or a hook, where a
// direct setState is the thing that escapes that discipline. Upstream marks it `recommended: false`,
// so it is a house choice rather than a correctness rule.
//
// # Component membership is the gate, and it is a real question here
//
// `class Hello { m(){ this.setState({}); } }` with no heritage is silent, measured against the
// installed build on 2026-08-27. That is worth stating because the neighbouring `no-is-mounted`
// looks identical and asks something different: it walks ancestors for a method-like node and never
// asks what the enclosing class extends, so it reports on exactly that shape. The shelf's
// `EnclosingComponent` doc comment warns about this in the opposite direction. This rule genuinely
// asks membership, so the walk below asks it.
//
// # Which factory spellings count
//
// Only `createReactClass`. Measured: a bare `createClass({...})` and a namespaced
// `React.createClass({...})` are both silent, so this reuses `isCreateReactClassCall` from
// `no-multi-comp` rather than the shelf's `IsEs5ComponentCall`, which accepts all three. Upstream's
// corpus writes `createReactClass` alone and cannot see the difference.
//
// # Every usage reports, not the component
//
// Upstream collects usages per component and reports each one, so a component calling setState
// twice produces two findings. Measured, and reproduced.
//
// # No fix
//
// Removing a setState call means deciding where the state goes instead, which is a refactor.
// Upstream ships no fixer either.

// setStateCalleeOf returns the `this.setState` callee of a call, or nil.
//
// Upstream tests three things in one condition: the callee is a member expression, its object is a
// `this` expression, and its property is NAMED setState. That last one is why a computed
// `this["setState"]({})` is silent, since upstream reads `callee.property.name` and a computed
// member has no name there. Measured silent against the installed build on 2026-08-27, which is a
// shape the corpus does not write.
//
// Parentheses are unwrapped because our parser keeps them where upstream's folds them away, so
// `(this).setState({})` reaches upstream's member branch as a plain `this`.

	// on 2026-08-27, beside a plain control that also reports.
	//
	// Our parser spells the same node as `KindPrivateIdentifier` whose `Text()` carries the hash,
	// so a naive comparison declines it and a naive port silently narrows the rule. The hash is
	// trimmed rather than compared against a hashed literal, so the two spellings meet at
	// upstream's own value. This is the doubled-hash hazard arriving from the other direction: the
	// text already carries the sigil and the question is what upstream compared, not what reads
	// naturally.
	//
	// An element access, `this["setState"]({})`, never reaches here at all: it is a different node
	// kind and the guard above declines it, which reproduces upstream declining it for its own
	// reason, that a computed member has no `property.name`. Measured silent both places.

// `IsEs5ComponentCall` and therefore accepts two factory spellings upstream rejects here, and
// `IsEs6ComponentClass`, which declines a parenthesized heritage receiver. Both narrowings are
// measured in `no-multi-comp` beside the predicates this reuses.
