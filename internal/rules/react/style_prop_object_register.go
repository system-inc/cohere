// The decoder is hand-rolled rather than `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` so an empty body answers with an
// empty allow list rather than an error. Note the direction: an empty list here means the rule
// examines EVERY element, which is the opposite of the two sibling forbid rules where an empty list
// means the rule declines everything.
