// Ported from React's `globals` rule, which is `ErrorCategory.Globals` in the React Compiler. Both
// authorities were readable and both were run rather than reasoned about:
//
//	react 7.1.1   node_modules/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/cjs/eslint-plugin-react-hooks.development.js
//	              driven through the ESLint Linter API on 150-plus probe inputs
//	oxc           crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/globals.rs, a category filter over
//	              crates/oxc_react_compiler, plus its 1-pass 1-fail corpus and snapshot
//
// The two agree on every input measured here, including the corpus, the message text, and the span.
// No divergence between them was found and none is recorded.
//
// # What the rule is actually about, and why "global" is the wrong word for it
//
// The name says globals and the diagnostic says "declared outside of the component/hook", and the
// diagnostic is the accurate one. Measured against React's own rule, every one of these reports:
//
//	someUnknownGlobal = true;      no declaration anywhere in the program
//	let g = 0;   g = 1;            an ordinary module-scope binding
//	const g = 0; g = 1;            likewise, and it is also a const violation
//	import {g} from 'm'; g = 1;    an import binding
//	function g() {}  g = 1;        a function declaration
//	class g {}       g = 1;        a class declaration
//	Object = 1;                    a standard-library binding
//
// So a port keyed on "the name does not resolve" would have found only the first of those seven,
// which is one of the nine distinct cases in React's own corpus. Resolution is not the question;
// **where the resolved declaration lives** is. That was the single most load-bearing measurement in
// this port and it inverted the approach the dispatch proposed.
//
// The complement matters as much. A write to a binding the compiled function itself declares is
// silent, and so is a write to a binding an *enclosing* function inside the same compilation root
// declares:
//
//	function Component() { let x = 1; x = 2; ... }                       silent
//	function Component() { let x = 1; const f = () => { x = 2; }; f(); } silent
//
// The second is a closure capture, and it is the case the intermediate representation in
// `internal/utilities/hir` gets wrong. See the note on routes below.
//
// # Why this does not read the HIR, which lowers `StoreGlobal` directly
//
// `internal/utilities/hir` landed the same day as this rule and emits a `StoreGlobal` instruction,
// which reads as the whole detection already done. It was not used, and the reasons were measured
// rather than inferred. Both were re-probed at `19ac208`, the commit that taught lowering to resolve
// captures, because the first probe predated it and a stale measurement is worse than none.
//
// **A `StoreGlobal` still cannot separate an import from a true global.** Probed at current head,
// `import {g} from 'mod'; g = 2;` and a bare undeclared `someGlobal = 2;` lower to byte-identical
// instructions, and `GlobalBindingKind` is declared with several variants that lowering never sets
// to anything but `Global` (`lower.go:57` states this). For most consumers that is a small gap. For
// this rule it is the entire question, because the diagnostic is about **where a binding is
// declared** and an import and an unresolved name sit on opposite ends of that. Both happen to
// report here, so it would not have produced a wrong answer today, but the rule would have been
// resting on a coincidence rather than on the distinction it claims to make.
//
// **The capture gap is half closed, and the surviving half is the half this rule would meet.**
// Before `19ac208` a write to an enclosing function's local lowered to `StoreGlobal`, where React
// classifies it as a `StoreContext` and is silent. That is now fixed when the enclosing component is
// the lowering root. It is NOT fixed when the nested function is lowered as its own root, which is
// how a per-function rule reaches it. Measured at current head on one input, printing both:
//
//	function Component() { let x = 1; const f = () => { x = 2; }; f(); return null; }
//	  lowering the COMPONENT  ->  StoreContext reassign x$2 = $1     correct, and silent
//	  lowering the ARROW      ->  StoreGlobal x = $1                 still the old answer
//
// `high_level_intermediate_representation.Lower` takes one function and builds its own identifier table, and
// `lowerAssignmentTarget` emits `StoreGlobal` for any target not in that table, so which answer a
// consumer gets depends on which node it handed the lowering. A rule built on this would have had
// to be careful about its own traversal in a way nothing in the instruction set signals.
//
// The checker has neither gap: it resolves to a declaration, and the declaration's file and position
// are readable directly, so an import, a module binding, a standard-library binding, a capture and a
// local are all separable by the same test. So the route here is the checker. None of this is a
// criticism of that package, which is young and whose own header lists both gaps; it is a statement
// of why this particular rule could not consume it yet, and a later version plausibly can.
//
// # The third route, and why it was not taken either
//
// `internal/utilities/ecmascript/reference` already answers "does this identifier write to its
// binding", and `core/no-global-assign` already answers a question one word away from this one.
// Neither is the whole rule, but the structural half is genuinely the same question, and it is
// reused here rather than rewritten. Its doc comment records the 625-false-positive incident where
// `document.cookie = x` was read as a write to a binding named `cookie`; that guard is inside
// `WritesToBinding` and this rule inherits it. Writing a fourth implementation of the write test
// was the thing the shelf exists to prevent.
//
// # Which writes count, measured shape by shape
//
// Every result below was produced by running React's own rule on the input, holding everything but
// the operator fixed, with a control assignment in the same function proving the function was not
// simply bailing out. The reporting set:
//
//	g = 1                            =
//	g += -= *= /= %= **=             the arithmetic compounds
//	g <<= >>= >>>= &= |= ^=          the bitwise compounds
//	[g] = xs   ({g} = o)             destructuring assignment, every nesting
//	[...g] = xs   ({...g} = o)       including a rest element
//	[g = 5] = []                     including a default
//
// And the silent set, which is the surprising half:
//
//	g++  g--  ++g  --g               update expressions
//	g ||= 1   g &&= 1   g ??= 1      the logical compounds
//	g.x = 1   g[0] = 1               a write through a property of the global
//	for (g of xs) {}                 the head of a for-of or for-in
//
// The update expressions and the logical compounds are the ones a port will get wrong, because
// every other assignment form reports and these read as assignment forms. They are silent because
// lowering emits no `StoreGlobal` for them at all: the update path in `build_hir.rs` constructs a
// `PostfixUpdate`/`PrefixUpdate` whose lvalue is a place rather than a global store, and the
// logical compounds lower as branching structures. Both were measured with a control in the same
// function, so neither is a bailout. `error.update-global-should-bailout` in React's own corpus
// uses `+=` rather than `++` for exactly this reason.
//
// The `for (g of xs)` case is different and worth stating separately: it does not merely fail to
// report, it takes the **whole function** silent, control included. That is a lowering failure
// rather than a decision, so it is reproduced here as silence on the write without reproducing the
// whole-function bailout. Recorded as a stated divergence rather than smoothed over: a file with an
// undeclared for-of loop variable and a separate global write reports here and not upstream.
//
// A property write is not this rule at all. `wat.test = 1` on a module-scope `wat` reports under
// React's **immutability** rule with a different message ("This value cannot be modified"), which
// is why `error.store-property-in-global` and `error.mutate-property-from-global` are named for
// globals and carry no `Globals` diagnostic. Two fixtures that read as this rule's and are not.
//
// # Where the finding points, which is two different spans in one rule
//
// A simple assignment points at the **identifier**; a compound assignment points at the **whole
// assignment expression**. Measured, holding the name long enough to tell the two apart:
//
//	longGlobalName = 1     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          the name
//	longGlobalName += 1    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     the name, the operator, and the right side
//
// That is not an accident of formatting. Lowering has two sites: the simple path passes
// `Some(ident_span)` (`build_hir.rs:4408`) and the compound path passes `span`, the assignment's
// own (`build_hir.rs:4534`). oxc's snapshot and React's goldens agree on both. A message-id
// assertion cannot see either, so both are asserted by span in the fixtures.
//
// A destructuring target points at the element rather than the statement, and a defaulted element
// points at the whole binding element (`[g = 5]` reports `g = 5`, not `g`). A parenthesized simple
// target reports the identifier **inside** the parens while a parenthesized compound target reports
// from the open paren, which follows from the same two spans and is pinned by a fixture.
//
// # The gate, which decides more inputs than the write test does
//
// None of this fires outside a function React Compiler compiles. The gate is shared with
// `unsupported-syntax` in this package, where it was measured over seventeen probe rounds against
// React's own rule, and every one of its properties was re-confirmed here on this rule's own
// diagnostic before it was reused:
//
//	function helper() { g = 1; }                          silent, name is not a component or hook
//	function Component() { g = 1; }                       silent, no JSX and no hook call
//	function Component() { g = 1; return <div />; }        reports
//	function Component(...props) { g = 1; return <div />; }        silent, rest parameter
//	function Component(a, b) { g = 1; return <div />; }            silent, second is not a ref
//	function Component(a, ref) { g = 1; return <div />; }          reports
//	function useFoo() { useState(0); g = 1; }                      reports, hook
//
// Reusing it rather than restating it is deliberate: two copies of a gate this intricate would
// drift, and the drift would be invisible because each copy would pass its own fixtures.
//
// # What this port does NOT reproduce, stated as a subset rather than left to be discovered
//
// A write inside a **nested function** is reported by React only when its effects pass can prove
// that function runs during render, and that proof is an inter-procedural aliasing analysis rather
// than anything syntactic. Measured, and the boundary is not a rule anybody could state:
//
//	const f = () => { g = 1; }; f();                       reports
//	const f = () => { g = 1; };                            silent, never called
//	const f = () => { g = 1; }; return <Foo cb={f} />;     silent, passed as a prop
//	const f = () => { g = 1; }; return <Foo>{f}</Foo>;     reports, passed as children
//	const a = () => { const b = () => { g = 1; }; b(); }; a();   silent, nested inline
//	const b = () => { g = 1; }; const a = () => { b(); }; a();   reports
//	function a() { g = 1; } a();                           silent when the call precedes the declaration
//
// The last three are the tell: the same call depth gives opposite answers depending on how the
// functions are spelled and ordered. That is the effects pass, and it is Tier C work. So this rule
// reports **only writes lexically inside the compilation root's own body**, not inside any nested
// function, and that is a stated subset: it misses findings React produces and adds none React does
// not. `TestGlobalsBoundary` pins the subset so it stays a decision rather than becoming a drift.
//
// Three further exclusions inside the root's own body, all measured with controls in the same
// function so that none of them is a bailout being misread:
//
//	try {} catch (e) { g = 1; }      silent, a catch body is not on the render path
//	try {} finally { g = 1; }        silent, likewise
//	return <div />; g = 1;           silent, unreachable after the return
//
// The unreachable case is reproduced by declining a write in a statement that follows a `return`,
// `throw`, `break` or `continue` in the same statement list. That is narrower than real
// reachability and deliberately so: it is the shape upstream's own corpus and this rule's probes
// exercise, and a full reachability answer belongs in the control-flow graph rather than here.
//
// No fix. The repair is a `useState` or an effect, which is a change of design rather than of text,
// and upstream proposes none either.

// declaredOutsideCompilationRoot reports whether the binding an identifier writes to is declared
// outside the function React Compiler is compiling.
//
// This is the rule's actual judgment, and it reproduces `resolve_identifier` at
// `oxc_react_compiler/.../hir_builder.rs:760-810`, which classifies a binding as global or module
// local when it has no symbol, when it is a type-only declaration, when its scope is the program
// scope, or when its scope is not within the compiled function.
//
// # Why every declaration is examined rather than the first, and the survivor that says so
//
// The port brief's standing rule is never to index `symbol.Declarations[0]`, and this rule is the
// shape where a loop is right rather than a single choice: it asks "is this binding declared
// outside", so a symbol carrying several declarations is outside only when they all are. Measured,
// `Object` carries two declarations, an interface and a variable, both in `lib.es5.d.ts`; a merged
// `interface Foo` above a `var Foo` in source carries two in the source file.
//
// **A mutant replacing this loop with `symbol.Declarations[0]` SURVIVES the whole suite, and so does
// one taking the last declaration.** That was chased rather than accepted, because the brief calls
// equivalence the comfortable verdict and the one most likely to be wrong.
//
// The two versions can differ on exactly one kind of input: a symbol whose declarations straddle the
// compilation root, some inside and some outside. Fifteen shapes were probed looking for one, each
// printing every declaration's kind and its side of the boundary: a module `var` plus an inner
// `var`, a module `function` plus an inner `function`, a module `interface` plus an inner
// `function`, a module `type`/`namespace`/`enum` each plus an inner `var`, an `interface` and a
// `var` merged at module scope, an `interface` and a `var` merged inside the component, an ambient
// `declare var` plus a local, and `Object`.
//
// **Not one straddles**, and the reason is structural rather than a property of the sample.
// Declaration merging happens within a single scope; an inner declaration of the same name does not
// merge with an outer one, it SHADOWS it, and the checker mints a separate symbol. Every probe with
// an inner declaration came back `decls=1` pointing inside, and every probe with only outer ones
// came back with all of them outside. So no input can put declarations of one symbol on both sides,
// and the mutants are equivalent rather than unseen.
//
// The loop is kept anyway, and that is a deliberate choice rather than an oversight of the sweep.
// It is not slower in any measurable way, it states the question the rule is actually asking, and
// the equivalence rests on a checker behavior this rule does not own. `M14b`, which flips the loop's
// verdict rather than its extent, is caught by 53 subtests, so the loop body is genuinely reached
// and the fixtures see through it; only first-versus-any is unobservable.
//

// the smallest part of what it catches.
