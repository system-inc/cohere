// Ported from `react/jsx-props-no-spread-multi`, read against oxc's
// `jsx_props_no_spread_multi.rs` and against `eslint-plugin-react`'s own
// `jsx-props-no-spread-multi.js`. Neither source carries an option surface: oxc declares no
// `from_configuration` and ESLint's `meta` block has no `schema` key at all, so the inventory's
// `options: "no"` is right here and was checked rather than taken.
//
// # Two judgments, not one, and they count differently
//
// The name suggests one question and the implementation asks two, against two disjoint sets of
// spreads, with different reporting arithmetic. Establishing this was the whole first hour, because
// a port that collapses them passes every imported fixture: upstream's fail corpus has at most one
// repeated expression per element, so the two readings agree on all five.
//
// **Identifier spreads are grouped.** `{...props}` is keyed by the identifier's name into a map, and
// the whole group produces exactly one finding however many copies there are. So
// `<div {...props} {...props} {...props} />` reports ONCE.
//
// **Member-expression spreads are paired.** `{...props.foo}` is pushed onto a list and every
// unordered PAIR is compared, so N copies produce N*(N-1)/2 findings.
// `<App {...props.foo} {...props.foo} {...props.foo} />` reports THREE times. Measured on the
// release oxlint binary rather than inferred from `array_combinations`, and pinned by a fixture
// below that upstream does not have, since upstream never writes a third copy of a member
// expression.
//
// The two sets do not overlap and neither is a fallback for the other: an identifier is never a
// member expression, so `<App {...props} {...props.foo} />` is silent in both halves.
//
// # Where ESLint and oxc disagree, and which one this follows
//
// ESLint implements only the identifier half. Its filter is
// `attr.argument.type === 'Identifier'`, so `<App {...props.foo} {...props.foo} />` is silent there
// and reports here. It also reports once per extra occurrence rather than once per group, so a
// third copy is a second finding under ESLint and still one finding here. oxc is followed on both
// counts, because oxc is what the gate being replaced actually runs, and because the member half is
// the larger part of what the rule is for. The divergence is stated rather than quietly resolved.
//
// # Parentheses and TypeScript wrappers, which upstream does strip
//
// This is the one place the brief warns that guessing is free at fixture time, so it was measured
// on the release binary in both directions rather than assumed. oxc reaches
// `without_parentheses()` and then `get_identifier_reference()`, which itself calls
// `get_inner_expression()`, so the peeled set is parentheses plus the TypeScript wrappers `as`,
// `satisfies`, `!`, instantiation and type assertion. `ast.SkipOuterExpressions` with
// `OEKParentheses|OEKAssertions` is the same set, less `OEKPartiallyEmittedExpressions`, which the
// parser never produces from source text.
//
// Measured, all against the release binary:
//
//	<App {...(props)} {...props} />                       REPORTS   parens peel
//	<App {...props!} {...props!} />                       REPORTS   non-null peels
//	<App {...props as any} {...props as any} />           REPORTS   as peels
//	<App {...(props.foo)} {...(props.foo)} />             REPORTS   and names `props.foo`
//	<App {...(props.foo).baz} {...(props.foo.baz)} />     REPORTS   inner parens peel in the compare
//	<App {...(props.foo).baz} {...(props.y.baz)} />       SILENT    different receiver
//
// The fourth line is the subtle one and it is why the finding is reported on the spread attribute
// rather than on the expression: after peeling, the two arguments are the same node shape but their
// source ranges differ from the written text, so a rule reporting the expression would point at a
// range that does not include the parentheses the reader wrote.
//
// # Optional chaining, which is the hardest thing in this port and is entirely measured
//
// `<App {...props?.foo} {...props?.foo} />` is SILENT in oxc and is silent here, and the two are
// silent for completely different reasons, which is why this needs a section rather than a line.
//
// oxc wraps an optional chain in a `ChainExpression`, a sibling variant of `MemberExpression`, so
// `as_member_expression()` on the spread argument returns `None` and the spread never enters either
// collection. Our parser has no such wrapper: `props?.foo` parses to an ordinary
// `KindPropertyAccessExpression` carrying a question-dot token, which a literal translation of
// oxc's code would happily compare against a plain `props.foo` and report. So this is the one place
// in the port where reproducing upstream takes an extra condition rather than one fewer.
//
// The extra condition has a boundary, and the boundary is not where anybody would guess. Six inputs
// were run against the release binary to find it, none of which any imported fixture writes:
//
//	<App {...props?.foo} {...props?.foo} />    SILENT    the plain case
//	<App {...a?.b.c}     {...a?.b.c}     />    SILENT    a question-dot one link DOWN still
//	                                                     disqualifies: the ChainExpression wraps the
//	                                                     whole chain, not the one optional link
//	<App {...(a?.b.c)}   {...(a?.b.c)}   />    SILENT    parenthesizing the whole chain wraps the
//	                                                     ChainExpression and changes nothing
//	<App {...(a?.b).c}   {...(a?.b).c}   />    REPORTS   parenthesizing a PREFIX terminates the
//	                                                     chain, so the outer access is ordinary
//	<App {...(a?.b).c}   {...(a.b).c}    />    REPORTS   and a terminated chain compares EQUAL to
//	                                                     the non-optional spelling
//	<App {...props[a?.b]} {...props[a.b]} />   REPORTS   a chain NESTED in a subscript is ordinary
//	                                                     structure and compares equal too
//
// Two rules fall out and both are load-bearing. The exclusion applies only to the spread ARGUMENT,
// never to an expression nested inside one, which is why `isSameExpression` reaches for a plain
// access check while the argument loop reaches for `isSpreadableMemberExpression`. And the walk
// looking for a question-dot descends through receivers but STOPS at a parenthesis or a TypeScript
// assertion, because those terminate the chain rather than being transparent to it.
//
// The first version of this rule had both halves wrong: it excluded nested chains and it descended
// through parentheses, so lines four, five and six above were silently missed. Neither error was
// visible from any fixture. What exposed them was mutating the descent, finding the mutant survived,
// and going to the binary to ask why rather than adding a fixture to kill it.
//
// The intuitive reading is that `props?.foo` twice IS the same double spread and should report, and
// that reading is recorded here beside the actual one precisely so the next reader does not
// helpfully correct the rule back to it.
//
// # A variable subscript compares as equal here, which the shelf declines to do
//
// `<App {...props[k]} {...props[k]} />` REPORTS in oxc, measured. That is worth stating because it
// runs against the grain of every other same-reference judgment in this tree:
// `no_self_assign.go`'s `isSameReference` returns false for `a[i]` even against itself, and
// `property.AccessedName` declines a variable subscript by design, its doc saying a comparison
// involving one is "false rather than optimistic".
//
// Both of those are right for their own question and wrong for this one. They ask whether two reads
// hit the same memory, where an intervening write to `k` makes the answer unknowable. This rule asks
// whether the author wrote the same spread twice inside a single JSX element, where nothing can run
// between them, so `k` cannot change and the two spreads are genuinely redundant. oxc's
// `is_same_member_expression` falls through to a structural comparison of the subscript expressions
// for exactly this reason. So `AccessedName` is used for the static-key case it answers well and the
// comparison falls back to structure when it declines, rather than treating its decline as a verdict.
//
// # What a call expression contributes, which is nothing
//
// `<App {...props()} {...props()} />` is silent, measured. A call is neither an identifier nor a
// member expression, so it enters neither collection. This is upstream's judgment and it is
// correct rather than a gap: two calls may return different objects, so the second spread is not
// redundant.
//
// # No fix, and the reason is stated rather than left as an omission
//
// oxc declares `fix` and ships one, deleting all but the last spread. This port reports without it.
// The identifier half's fixer is defensible on its own, but the member half emits one fix per
// PAIR, so a third copy produces three findings whose fixes delete overlapping ranges, and the
// merged result on `<App {...props.foo} {...props.foo} {...props.foo} />` was measured on the
// release binary as `<App   {...props.foo} />`: correct output arrived at by three separate
// deletions that happen not to conflict. Reproducing that arithmetic faithfully is possible and
// reproducing it wrongly deletes a spread the author needed, unattended, and a wrong fix is worse
// than no fix. The subset shown correct here is the detection, and it is complete. If the fix is
// wanted later it should come with the three-copy case asserted through `ExpectFixedSource`, which
// is the only assertion that can see a repair writing the right text over the wrong span.
//
// # Two element kinds where oxc has one
//
// oxc listens on `JSXOpeningElement` and gets both shapes, because its parser gives a self-closing
// element an opening element carrying a `self_closing` flag. Our parser gives a self-closing
// element a distinct `JsxSelfClosingElement` with no opening element inside it, so listening on the
// literal translation of oxc's node would make this rule silent on every fail fixture upstream
// ships: all five are self-closing. Both kinds are listened on, which `jsx_no_duplicate_props.go`
// established here first.
