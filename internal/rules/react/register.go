// Package react holds the ported `eslint-plugin-react` rules.
//
// Named for the plugin whose namespace the inventory writes (`react/no-children-prop`), and kept
// separate from `internal/rules/structure/`, which also carries React judgments. The split is by
// who decided the rule rather than by what it is about: everything here reproduces a judgment
// upstream already makes and is measured against upstream's own corpus, while `structure` holds
// judgments this codebase made for itself and has no upstream to check against. Merging them would
// lose the ability to say which findings a differential run is allowed to disagree about.
//
// Distinct from `internal/utils/react/` despite the name, which holds the shared predicates these
// rules ask (`IsCreateElementCall`, `EnclosingComponent`) and is imported by rule packages rather
// than being one.

// init registers this package's rules with the catalog.
//
// Registration lives beside the rules rather than in a shared list another package maintains. That
// shared list was one file every port had to edit, so two ports landing at once conflicted on a
// file neither was really changing, and the conflict scaled with how many rules were being written
// at the same time. A rule is now two new files and no shared edit.
//
// The cost is that a package whose rules are never imported registers nothing, so the catalog would
// be silently short. `registry` imports every rule package for exactly that reason, and the parity
// guard reads the result against the inventory, so a package dropped from those imports shows up as
// rules that vanished rather than as a quieter run.
