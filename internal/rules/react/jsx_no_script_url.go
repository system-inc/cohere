// Ported from `react/jsx-no-script-url` in `eslint-plugin-react`, read from the clone at

// corpus cases were replayed against the installed build, version 7.37.5, through the ESLint Linter
// API before any code was written, and it agreed on all 22, counts and message ids alike.
// Everything below that the corpus does not state was measured the same way.
//
// # There is no file-suffix gate
//
// Three siblings in this package gate on `.tsx` and `.jsx`, which is oxc residue rather than
// upstream behaviour. This rule is ported from the authority, which has no such gate, so a `.ts`
// file holding JSX is examined. A fixture pins that.
//
// # The shared-settings half of the option surface has no substrate here, and it costs findings
//
// Upstream reads `settings.linkComponents` from ESLint's shared settings when `includeFromSettings`
// is true. cohere has no shared-settings surface anywhere, so that half of the rule cannot be
// expressed and this port answers as though the settings were empty. Measured, this is exactly what
// it costs on upstream's own corpus:
//
//	valid 9, 10, 11    clean with the settings and clean without them, so imported unchanged
//	invalid 6, 7       report ONLY because of settings, so silent here
//	invalid 8          two findings upstream, one here, the settings-supplied one lost
//
// Those three are recorded as fixtures at the verdict this port actually produces, with the
// upstream verdict named beside each, rather than deleted. Deleting them would hide a real gap; the
// gap is a missing configuration surface, not a defect in the judgment. Anything a user configures
// through the legacy array is reproduced exactly.
//
// # What counts as a value
//
// Upstream requires the attribute value to be a Literal, so only a plain string attribute is read.
// An expression container declines even when its content is a string literal, which upstream's
// corpus pins directly, and a bare `<a href />` has no value at all.
// `jsx.StringAttributeValue` asks the same question, but it searches an attribute list by name;
// this rule anchors on the attribute itself, so it reads the initializer directly.
//
// # A namespaced attribute is invisible, and that is upstream's answer too
//
// Upstream reads the attribute's name and then that name's own name, which is absent for a
// namespaced attribute, so `<a xlink:href="javascript:">` is clean. `jsx.AttributeName` declines
// the same shape for the same reason, so the shelf helper and upstream agree here. Measured on the
// installed build.
//
// # The tag name must be a plain identifier
//
// The parent's name is read the same way, so a member tag and a namespaced tag are both clean,
// since neither carries a plain name under its name. Both measured. A port reading source text for
// the tag would report on inputs upstream ignores.
