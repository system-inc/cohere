// Ported from `react/state-in-constructor` in `eslint-plugin-react`, read from the clone at
// `lib/rules/state-in-constructor.js` together with the three helpers it calls:
// `componentUtil.getParentES6Component`, `componentUtil.isStateMemberExpression`, and
// `astUtil.inConstructor`. Every divergence below was measured by driving the installed build
// (`eslint-plugin-react` 7.37.5) through the ESLint Linter API rather than reasoned from the source.
//
// # There is no file-suffix gate, and three sibling rules in this package have one
//
// Those siblings inherited it from oxc, which gates on `source_type().is_jsx()`. This rule was
// ported from the authority instead, and the authority has no such gate anywhere. Measured by
// running the installed rule over a component with no JSX in it, so every suffix parses and the
// parser cannot be confused with the rule, under `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts` and `.js`: all four report.
// A `.ts` file holding JSX is a parse error rather than a rule decision, which is why the probe had
// to drop the JSX to separate the two questions.
//
// # What the Always arm keys on, and the two places our parser disagrees with ESLint's
//
// Upstream tests `!node.static && node.key.name === 'state'`, and `key.name` is a field that only
// some key shapes carry. That makes the predicate depend on the parser's key representation rather
// than on anything the rule decided, and the two parsers represent two key shapes differently:
//
//	state = {}         reports upstream    Identifier, name `state`
//	static state = {}  SILENT upstream     excluded by !node.static
//	["state"] = {}     SILENT upstream     computed, so key is a Literal with no `.name`
//	"state" = {}       SILENT upstream     also a Literal with no `.name`
//	#state = {}        REPORTS upstream    PrivateIdentifier, whose `.name` is the bare `state`
//	state              reports upstream    no initializer; the rule never looks at the value
//	declare state: any reports upstream    a declaration is still a property definition
//
// The last two rows of that list are the interesting ones and they run opposite ways in our tree,
// which is why the comparison here is written against the key's KIND rather than only its text:
//
//   - A private name's `Text()` here is `#state`, with the hash, where the ESLint AST's `.name` is
//     the bare `state`. So a text comparison alone would go SILENT on `#state` and lose a finding
//     upstream produces. Upstream reporting there is a defect rather than a decision, since `#state`
//     is not React's state at all, but it is reproduced: fidelity is to what the rule decides, and
//     a port that silently improves on it is a divergence nothing records.
//
//   - A string-literal key's `Text()` here is the bare `state`, where ESLint's Literal carries the
//     value on `.value` and has no `.name`. So a text comparison alone would REPORT on `"state" =
//     {}` where upstream is silent, inventing a finding. This is the direction that costs a false
//     positive, and it is the reason the key kind is checked at all.
//
// Neither shape is anywhere in the corpus, so both would have shipped green.
//
// # What the Never arm keys on
//
// Upstream tests `isStateMemberExpression(node.left) && inConstructor(...) && getParentES6Component(...)`.
// `isStateMemberExpression` requires the left side to be a member expression whose object is a
// `ThisExpression` and whose property is named `state`, so the target must be exactly `this.state`
// and nothing deeper. Measured:
//
//	this.state = {}          reports    the direct target
//	this.state.x = 1         SILENT     the target is `this.state.x`, whose object is not `this`
//	this["state"] = {}       SILENT     an element access, not a member expression with a name
//	this.state += 1          reports    every assignment operator, not only `=`
//	(this.state) = {}        reports    see the parentheses note below
//	(this).state = {}        reports    see the parentheses note below
//
// `inConstructor` walks the SCOPE chain upward rather than the syntactic ancestor chain, which
// sounds equivalent and is not: a write inside a callback declared in the constructor is still
// "in the constructor" to this rule, and upstream reports it. Measured:
//
//	constructor(p) { super(p); go(() => { this.state = {} }) }   REPORTS
//
// Reproduced here by walking ancestors and stopping at the first class, so a nested function does
// not end the walk but a nested class does. The nested-class stop is what makes a plain class
// written inside a component's constructor keep its own writes, and it is measured: a
// `class G { constructor() { this.state = {} } }` inside a real component's constructor is silent
// upstream, because `getParentES6Component` finds the inner class first and that one is not a
// component.
//
// # Parentheses, which have to be handled explicitly here and do not upstream
//
// ESLint's AST does not materialize a parenthesized expression as a node in these positions, so
// upstream never has to think about them and its corpus writes none. Ours does materialize them, so
// a port that ignores them goes silent on two shapes upstream reports. Both measured on the
// installed rule:
//
//	(this.state) = {}     REPORTS   parens around the whole target
//	(this).state = {}     REPORTS   parens around the receiver only
//
// So the target is unwrapped, and so is the receiver inside it. That is the opposite of the
// advice `no-direct-mutation-state` in this package records, where paren-skipping inside the chain
// would have INVENTED findings; the difference is that the rule being ported there was oxc's, whose
// tree keeps parens where ESLint's discards them. The authority decides, and the authority here is
// ESLint's.
//
// The span in both parenthesized cases is the whole assignment expression including the parens,
// which is what upstream reports and what the fixtures below assert by slicing the source.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// Upstream passes the node itself to `report` in both arms, so the Always arm underlines the whole
// property declaration and the Never arm underlines the whole assignment expression, operator and
// right-hand side included. Measured by slicing the reported span out of the source:
//
//	state = { bar: 0 }                  the Always span, initializer included
//	state                               the Always span when there is no initializer
//	this.state = { bar: 0 }             the Never span, right-hand side included
//
// A message-id assertion cannot see any of that, so every fixture below asserts the sliced text.
