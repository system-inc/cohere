// Ported from `react/forbid-foreign-prop-types` in `eslint-plugin-react`, read from the clone at
// `lib/rules/forbid-foreign-prop-types.js`. One option, one message, no fixer. The whole 20-case
// corpus was replayed against the installed build (7.37.5) through the ESLint Linter API before any
// code was written, and it agreed on all 20. Everything below that the corpus does not state was
// measured the same way, on inputs written for the question.
//
// # There is no file-suffix gate
//
// Three siblings in this package gate on `.tsx`/`.jsx`, which is oxc residue rather than upstream
// behaviour. This rule is ported from the authority, which has no such gate, and most of what it
// would catch is in plain `.ts` files: `const { propTypes } = SomeComponent` needs no JSX at all.
//
// # Two upstream selectors, and neither is about React
//
// The rule never asks whether anything is a component. A member access whose property is named
// `propTypes` reports, and an object destructuring pattern with a `propTypes` key reports, whatever
// the receiver is. That breadth is upstream's judgment and reproducing it means not adding a
// component check that would look like an improvement.
//
// # What counts as the property name
//
//	Foo.propTypes            reports, a plain identifier property
//	Foo["propTypes"]         reports, upstream's second arm matches a Literal property
//	Foo[propTypes]           CLEAN, a computed identifier has no literal text to compare
//	Foo[`propTypes`]         CLEAN, a template is not a Literal to upstream's parser
//	Foo?.propTypes           reports, optional chaining is still a member access
//	Foo.Bar.propTypes        reports, the receiver is not examined
//
// All measured. The element-access arm exists because upstream wrote it, and its corpus carries the
// reporting case; the computed-identifier decline is a corpus case too.
//
// # Being the target of an assignment exempts, and the definition of that is narrow
//
// Upstream calls `ast.isAssignmentLHS`, which is `parent.type === 'AssignmentExpression' &&
// parent.left === node`. Two consequences were measured and neither is obvious:
//
//	Foo.propTypes = {}       CLEAN, it is the left of an assignment
//	Foo.propTypes += 1       CLEAN, a compound assignment is still an AssignmentExpression
//	Foo.propTypes++          REPORTS, an update expression is not one
//	delete Foo.propTypes     REPORTS, a unary operator is not one
//
// The `++` and `delete` cases are upstream reporting on code that plainly writes rather than reads,
// and they are reproduced rather than corrected. `ast.IsAssignmentExpression(node, false)` is the
// exact equivalent: it accepts the plain and the compound operators alike, which is what ESTree's
// single `AssignmentExpression` type covers, and rejects every unary form.
//
// # The parenthesis difference costs a false positive here, in the direction that reports
//
// `(Foo.propTypes) = {}` is CLEAN upstream, measured. Its parser folds the parenthesis away, so the
// member access IS the assignment's `left`. Ours keeps a `KindParenthesizedExpression` between
// them, so a naive `node.Parent` test sees a parenthesis rather than an assignment, concludes the
// access is not a target, and reports where upstream is silent. The parent walk unwraps
// parentheses in a loop, because `((Foo.propTypes)) = {}` nests. Written as a loop rather than with
// `ast.SkipParentheses`, which dereferences its argument.
//
// # `allowInPropTypes` searches upward for two enclosing shapes
//
// Upstream walks up from the reported node to `Program`, twice, looking for an
// `AssignmentExpression` whose left-hand property is named `propTypes`, and for a class property
// whose key is named `propTypes`. Either one exempts. Both walks are unbounded, which is what makes
// the exemption reach arbitrarily deep:
//
//	Foo.propTypes = { a: { b: Bar.propTypes.c } }        exempt, nested two levels
//	class C { static propTypes = { a: () => Q.propTypes.c }; }   exempt, through a closure
//	Foo.other = Bar.propTypes                            REPORTS, the left property is not propTypes
//
// All measured under `{allowInPropTypes: true}`. The class-property walk does NOT require `static`,
// measured: `class C { propTypes = { a: Q.propTypes.b }; }` is exempt too. And a computed class key
// declines, because upstream reads `classProperty.key.name`, which a computed key does not have.
//
// The two walks are separate in upstream and are kept separate here, because the assignment walk
// tests the assignment's LEFT while the class walk tests the declaration's own key, and collapsing
// them into one upward scan would need a different test at each stop anyway.
//
// # The destructuring arm reports once per pattern and points at the whole member
//
// Upstream uses `properties.find`, so a pattern naming `propTypes` twice reports ONCE. Measured:
// `const { propTypes, propTypes: q } = Foo` produces a single finding. The finding is anchored on
// the matched property rather than on its key, so `const { propTypes: p } = Foo` spans
// `propTypes: p` and not just the key. Both are reproduced.
//
// A computed or string-literal key in a pattern declines, because upstream reads `property.key.name`
// there too:
//
//	const { propTypes } = Foo            reports
//	const { propTypes: p } = Foo         reports
//	const { ["propTypes"]: p } = Foo     CLEAN
//	const { "propTypes": p } = Foo       CLEAN
//	const [ propTypes ] = Foo            CLEAN, an array pattern is not an ObjectPattern
//	function f({ propTypes }) {}         reports, any object pattern counts
//
// All measured. `allowInPropTypes` is NOT consulted on this arm, upstream, which is visible in the
// source rather than measured: the `ObjectPattern` handler calls neither `isAllowedAssignment` nor
// anything like it. Reproduced.
