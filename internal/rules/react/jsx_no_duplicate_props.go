// JsxNoDuplicateProps flags a JSX element that writes the same prop name twice.

//
// Ported from `react/jsx-no-duplicate-props`, read against oxc's `jsx_no_duplicate_props.rs` and
// against `eslint-plugin-react`'s own `jsx-no-duplicate-props.js`. The two sources disagree in two
// places and oxc is followed in both, because oxc is what the gate being replaced actually runs.
//
// # Where the two upstreams disagree, and which one this follows
//
// **The option surface.** ESLint carries an `ignoreCase` boolean that lowercases every name before
// comparing, so `<App foo Foo />` reports under it. oxc implements none of it, and says so in its
// own doc comment rather than leaving it as an omission: props are case-sensitive in JSX, so two
// spellings that differ in case are two different props and neither overwrites the other. This rule
// takes no options for the same reason. Four of the twelve upstream clean cases exist only to pin
// this, so a port that lowercased names would fail a third of the clean corpus rather than sliding
// through.
//
// **Where the finding points.** ESLint reports the whole `JSXAttribute`, initializer included. oxc
// reports the two *names*, passing `with_labels([span1, span2])` where `span1` is the earlier
// occurrence and `span2` the one just found. Our harness carries one range per finding, so the
// earlier occurrence is the one reported, which is what oxc renders as the diagnostic's primary
// position: the snapshot for `<App {...this.props} a="a" b="b" a="a" />` prints `1:22`, the first
// `a` after the spread rather than the second. Measured against the release oxlint binary as well
// as read from the snapshot, because a two-label diagnostic's primary span is not something the
// snapshot format states outright.
//
// # Once per extra occurrence, not once per pair
//
// The map is written on every attribute, so a third copy is compared against the second rather than
// the first. `<App a a a />` therefore reports twice and `<App a a a a />` three times. This is
// worth stating because the other reading, one finding per duplicated name, is the more natural
// design and produces a different count on exactly the input no upstream fixture covers: every fail
// case upstream ships has at most two copies of one name, so both readings agree on all nine and
// the corpus cannot tell them apart. Measured on the release oxlint binary rather than inferred,
// and pinned by a fixture below that upstream does not have.
//
// # Two element kinds where oxc has one
//
// oxc listens on `JSXOpeningElement` and gets both shapes, because its parser gives a self-closing
// element an opening element with a `self_closing` flag. Our parser gives it a distinct
// `JsxSelfClosingElement` with no `JsxOpeningElement` inside it, so listening on the literal
// translation of oxc's node would make this rule silent on every fail fixture upstream ships: all
// nine are self-closing. Both kinds are listened on here and a probe confirms they never both fire
// for one element, so there is no double-report to guard against.
//
// # What a spread does, and what it does not do
//
// A spread is a `JsxSpreadAttribute` in the properties list rather than an absent node, so it is
// skipped by kind rather than by being invisible. It neither reports nor resets what has been seen:
// `<App a="a" {...this.props} b="b" a="a" />` reports, because the map survives across it. What
// upstream cannot see is a name *inside* the spread, so `<App a {...{a: 1}} />` is silent in both
// tools even though it is the same collision. That is a real gap and it is reproduced rather than
// improved on: deciding what a spread contributes would mean evaluating an arbitrary expression,
// and a rule that guessed would report on code whose real props are unknown.
//
// # Namespaced names, which never participate
//
// `<svg xlink:href="x" xlink:href="y" />` is silent, in oxc and here. oxc destructures
// `JSXAttributeName::Identifier` and a namespaced name is the sibling variant, so it returns before
// reaching the map; `jsx.AttributeName` declines the same shape by requiring `KindIdentifier`, and a
// probe confirms it answers `named=false` there. The decline is correct for this rule rather than
// merely convenient, and the reason is that a namespaced name would need its prefix compared too:
// treating `xlink:href` as `href` would make it collide with a plain `href` that sets a different
// attribute entirely. Verified against the release oxlint binary, which is silent on both
// `<svg xlink:href="x" xlink:href="y" />` and `<svg href="x" xlink:href="y" />`.
//
// A dashed name is not the same case and does participate: `data-x` parses as a single identifier,
// so `<App data-x data-x />` reports in both tools.
