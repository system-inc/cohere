// Ported from React's `void-use-memo`. Both authorities implement it and they agree completely:
//
//	react 7.1.1   node_modules/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/cjs/eslint-plugin-react-hooks.development.js
//	              `validateUseMemo` at line 45992 and `hasNonVoidReturn` at 46139, unminified
//	oxc compiler  crates/oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_validation/validate_use_memo.rs
//	              a line-for-line transcription of the same function
//	oxc linter    crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/void_use_memo.rs, one pass and one fail case
//
// The two corpus cases were run through React itself and it reports identically to oxc's snapshot,
// span included, so there is no divergence to record between the implementations. Every behavioral
// claim below was measured by driving React's own rule through the ESLint Linter API on the input
// named, rather than derived from reading. That distinction earns its place twice over, because
// reading produced the wrong answer twice and one of the two wrong answers came from React's own
// documentation.
//
// # Whether this needs the intermediate representation, and why it does not
//
// It does not, and that is a measurement rather than a preference.
//
// Upstream runs this over its lowered representation, walking every block's instructions and keying
// three side tables on identifier ids: which temporaries hold `useMemo`, which hold `React`, and
// which hold a function expression. That reads like dataflow, and the pipeline position invites the
// same conclusion from the other direction: it runs at position 3, *before* single-assignment form,
// which is the strongest available evidence it needs no value numbering.
//
// The decisive evidence is neither of those. It is that **every input where dataflow could change
// the answer comes back clean**, and clean for a reason that makes the rule strictly weaker than it
// looks. `functions` is keyed on the temporary the `FunctionExpression` instruction produced. Bind
// that callback to a variable first and a `StoreLocal` plus a `LoadLocal` interpose, the identifier
// at the call site is a different one, and the lookup misses. Measured, all clean:
//
//	const cb = () => { foo(); }; useMemo(cb, []);       callback through a variable
//	const m = useMemo; m(() => { foo(); }, []);          callee through a variable
//	const R = React; R.useMemo(() => { foo(); }, []);    namespace through a variable
//	let cb = ...; cb = () => { foo(); }; useMemo(cb, []) reassigned callback
//	const cb = a ? f : g; useMemo(cb, []);               conditional callback
//
// So the rule only ever sees a callback written **syntactically inline at the call site**, and a
// callee that is syntactically `useMemo` or `React.useMemo`. Those are properties of the text. This
// is the same verdict `error-boundaries` reached and for the same reason: a syntactic property
// wearing a control-flow costume, where the costume exists because upstream has no syntax tree left
// by the time the validator runs. Building a graph to recover what the parent chain already states
// is the cargo cult the port brief names, and here it would additionally have to *reproduce a
// lookup failure* to stay faithful, which is a strange thing to build machinery for.
//
// The intermediate representation in `internal/utilities/hir` was read before this was written, and
// nothing in it is used. Recorded plainly so the next reader does not assume the omission was an
// oversight: this rule was the first candidate consumer after that package landed, and it declined.
//
// # The two findings, stated exactly
//
// **A callback returns nothing.** Upstream's `hasNonVoidReturn` asks whether *any* block in the
// lowered callback ends in a return terminal whose variant is `Explicit` or `Implicit`. Only the
// synthetic fallthrough terminal every function gets is `Void`. So the question is whether the
// callback contains a reachable `return` statement at all, or is a concise arrow body.
//
// **A result is unused_code_report.** Upstream records the call's own temporary and deletes it when any later
// instruction or terminal takes it as an operand. Since the very next instruction for `const x =
// call()` is a store consuming that temporary, this is not liveness: it is whether the call's value
// is syntactically discarded. Measured boundary, and it is exactly three shapes:
//
//	useMemo(...);                  reports    a bare expression statement
//	(useMemo(...));                reports    parenthesized, still discarded
//	(useMemo(...), 0);             reports    the LEFT operand of a comma is discarded
//	(0, useMemo(...));             clean      the right operand becomes the value
//	void useMemo(...);             clean      `void` takes it as an operand
//	const x = useMemo(...);        clean      even when `x` is never read afterwards
//
// The `const x` case is the one that decides the design and it is the natural wrong guess. A rule
// built on "is the result ever read" would report it, and upstream does not.
//
// # Where reading was wrong, both times
//
// **A bare `return;` is CLEAN.** React's `ReturnStatement` lowering hardcodes `returnVariant:
// 'Explicit'` whether or not an argument is present, minting `undefined` as the value, so a
// callback whose only return is `return;` satisfies `hasNonVoidReturn` and does not report. This
// contradicts React's own pass documentation, which states at
// `docs/passes/40-validateUseMemo.md` that "A function with only `return;` statements (void
// returns) will trigger the 'must return a value' error." The executable is the authority and the
// documentation is wrong about it. Pinned by a fixture, because it is the single most likely place
// for a port to helpfully improve on upstream and be wrong.
//
// **The `Void` variant is unreachable for a real return statement.** It is minted only for the
// synthetic terminal closing a function body, which is why the check reads as a three-way test and
// behaves as a two-way one.
//
// # What the name `LoadGlobal` does not mean
//
// It does not mean "resolves to nothing". It means "not bound inside the function being compiled",
// and module scope is outside it. Measured, and the pair is the whole of the shadowing rule:
//
//	const useMemo = ...; function Component() { useMemo(...) }     reports  (module scope)
//	function Component() { const useMemo = ...; useMemo(...) }     clean    (function scope)
//	function outer() { const useMemo = ...; function Component() { useMemo(...) } }   clean
//
// So the shadow test walks up from the call site to the enclosing compiled function and stops
// there. A binding in any enclosing *function* shadows; one at module scope does not. An import
// does not shadow either, which is why `import {useMemo} from 'react'` still reports, and why an
// alias `import {useMemo as useM}` escapes entirely: the test is on the written name.
//
// # Which functions are eligible
//
// The same driver gate `error-boundaries` reproduces, and it is shared with that rule rather than
// restated. Verified against this rule specifically on fifteen inputs, all agreeing: a lowercase
// name is clean, `_Private` and `Éomponent` are clean, `usething` is clean, `use2Things` reports, a
// nested component is clean, a class method is clean, three parameters is clean, a rest parameter
// is clean, `(props, ref)` reports, `(props, other)` is clean, and returning an object is clean.
//
// One clause differs from `error-boundaries` and it is worth stating because it runs the opposite
// way. That rule could omit `callsHooksOrCreatesJsx` on the grounds that it can only fire on a
// function containing JSX. This rule can fire on a function containing no JSX at all, and measured,
// `function Component() { const x = useMemo(() => { foo(); }, []); return x; }` **reports**. The
// clause is satisfied anyway, because a `useMemo` call is itself a hook call, so the gate is
// satisfied everywhere this rule could report and is likewise not written out.
//
// Bare `use` is the one place this rule's name test differs from the package's shared
// `isHookIdentifierName`. That predicate answers true for `use`, correctly, because
// `rules-of-hooks` needs it to. Measured here, `function use()` is **clean**, so the driver gate
// wants `use` followed by an uppercase letter or a digit and the bare form is excluded below.
//
// # Where the findings point
//
// Two different places, both byte-measured. The void-return finding points at the **callback**, and
// oxc's snapshot independently confirms it by logging column 25 for `() => {}`. The unused-result
// finding points at the **callee**, which is the bare identifier for `useMemo(...)` and the whole
// member expression for `React.useMemo(...)`.
//
// Parentheses are transparent in both positions and excluded from both spans, which the port brief
// makes a mandatory measurement. Measured on React rather than guessed: a parenthesized callback
// reports at column 22 rather than 21, and a parenthesized callee at column 4 rather than 3.
//
// # Divergences recorded rather than smoothed over
//
// **`void useMemo(...)` is silent and arguably should not be.** The `void` operator discards the
// value as plainly as an expression statement does, but upstream emits an instruction taking it as
// an operand, so the temporary is consumed and the finding is suppressed. Reproduced as silence.
//
// **An aliased import escapes the rule entirely.** `import {useMemo as useM} from 'react'` is a
// real `useMemo` and neither authority reports it, because both test the written name rather than
// resolving it. verify has a whole-program checker and could resolve it. Deliberately not done: it
// would report a class of finding neither authority produces, and a differential would show it.
