// Block 1 of `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/jsx_no_undef.rs` carries 12 pass and 8 fail
// cases, and the snapshot reports 8 diagnostics against those 8 fail inputs, so exactly one finding
// per input and no per-input recovery was needed. Block 2 is a second tester that is not
// snapshotted and carries one pair over `let x = <A.B />;`, distinguished only by a `globals`
// option. Its fail half is below; its pass half is the one case in this corpus that cannot be
// expressed here, because `verify` has no globals surface for it to configure. That is stated in
// the rule's doc comment rather than quietly dropped.
//
// Every string was decoded from the extractor's `-dump` output and then checked byte against byte
// into the Rust source by script before any Go was written. All 22 matched, which is worth stating
// because two of them are multi-line raw strings whose leading newline and eight-space indentation
// are part of what upstream tests.
