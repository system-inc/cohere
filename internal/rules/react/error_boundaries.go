// Ported from React's `error-boundaries` rule, whose implementation is
// `ValidateNoJSXInTryStatement.ts` and whose diagnostic category is `ErrorBoundaries`. oxc ships a
// Rust transcription at `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_validation/
// validate_no_jsx_in_try_statement.rs` that matches React line for line, including the comment; it
// is a second reading of the same source rather than an independent opinion, so there is nothing to
// choose between the two and no divergence to record between them. oxc's *linter* has no rule here.
//
// Authority is React, and it was **executed** rather than reasoned about. The rule ships in
// `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 7.1.1 as `react-hooks/error-boundaries`, and every behavioral claim
// in this comment was measured by driving it through the ESLint `Linter` API on the input named,
// rather than derived from reading. That distinction earns its place here because reading produced
// the wrong answer three separate times, each recorded below.
//
// # What upstream computes, and why this rule does not compute it the same way
//
// Upstream runs over the compiler's own intermediate representation. It walks the basic blocks in
// layout order carrying a stack of pending catch-handler block identifiers, pushes a handler when a
// block ends in a `try` terminal, pops it when the walk reaches that handler's own block, and flags
// any JSX instruction found while the stack is non-empty. Fifty two lines.
//
// **That is a control-flow spelling of a purely syntactic question, and it is a control-flow
// spelling only because upstream has no syntax tree left at that point.** The lowering has already
// run; blocks are all it has. Because the handler is popped exactly when its own block begins, and
// because the body's blocks are laid out between the `try` terminal and the handler, the stack is
// non-empty across precisely the extent of some enclosing try *block* — never across that same
// try's catch clause, and never across its finally clause. A catch clause is covered only when an
// *outer* try is still pending, which is the "unless that catch is itself nested inside an outer
// try" sentence in React's own doc comment.
//
// So the decision reduces to: **is this JSX construction syntactically within the `try` block of
// some enclosing try statement, up to the nearest enclosing function.** We have the syntax tree, so
// that is what this asks, by walking parents. It is the port brief's fidelity clause applied
// literally: fidelity is owed to what a rule *decides*, not to the machinery it needed to obtain it,
// and reproducing a block walk over a graph we would have to build first, to answer a question the
// parent chain already answers, is the cargo cult that clause names.
//
// **Stated plainly because this rule was the first consumer of the dominator tree and the dataflow
// solver added in `internal/utilities/controlflow`, and used neither.** Both were read first. Dominance
// answers "must control pass through A to reach B", which is a question about paths; this rule asks
// "is B written inside A", which is a question about text, and a try block does not dominate its own
// body in any useful sense once a throw edge exists. A dataflow would carry an "inside a try" bit
// forward over the graph and arrive at the same answer the parent chain gives directly, after
// building a graph, at strictly higher cost and with one new failure mode: the graph lays a
// `finally` block down **twice**, so a JSX in a finally would be visited twice, and the second copy
// is unreachable exactly when nothing takes the abrupt path. That duplication is a real hazard
// `internal/unused` works around by keying on source position rather than block identity. Walking
// parents has no such hazard because a node has one parent chain.
//
// The three control-flow traps the dispatch named were each checked against this design rather than
// assumed away, and all three are inert here: the doubled `finally` layout cannot double-report
// something reached through a parent chain; a try whose body cannot throw getting no edge to its
// catch cannot hide a catch body that is found by walking parents; and `labelsOf` keeping outer
// labels is about labeled statements, which this rule never reads.
//
// # Where the syntactic reading and React part company, both measured
//
// Two inputs exist where React is silent and a purely syntactic reading would report. Neither is a
// judgment about JSX in a try. Both are artifacts of the lowering that runs before the validator,
// and both are reproduced here as silence, deliberately, with the command that established them
// stated rather than asserted.
//
// **A try with no catch clause is silent, whatever is in it.** React's HIR builder does not support
// `try`/`finally` without a handler at all: it aborts the whole function with a Todo diagnostic,
// `(BuildHIR::lowerStatement) Handle TryStatement without a catch clause`, before any validation
// pass runs. Upstream's own corpus records this and is the reason the two fixtures named
// `error.todo-invalid-jsx-in-try-with-finally` and
// `error.todo-invalid-jsx-in-catch-in-outer-try-with-finally` carry the `error.todo` prefix: they
// are named `invalid-...` and they do not produce this rule's finding, they produce the Todo. Run
// through the real rule, `try { el = <div />; } finally { log(el); }` reports nothing. A finally
// *alongside* a catch is fine and the try body still reports, which is the case that separates
// "no catch clause" from "has a finally".
//
// **JSX whose value nothing consumes is silent.** The lowering drops instructions with no consumer
// before the validator sees them, so `try { (<div />); } catch {}` is clean upstream while
// `try { foo(<div />); } catch {}` reports, and `let el; try { el = <div />; } catch {} return 1;`
// is clean while inserting a single `log(el)` before that return makes it report. The consumer can
// be anything: a call argument, a return, a member assignment, a push.
//
// **This one cost the most and it is the reason every claim here names a command.** Reading, and
// then a first round of probing, attributed these silences to `returnsNonNode` in the component
// gate. The measurement that broke that reading is one line: hold everything fixed and vary only
// the final return, and `return <div />` is **clean** while `return el` **reports**. No account
// built on the returned expression's shape survives that, since a JSX element is maximally a node.
// The discriminator is whether `el` is read at all. Two independent filters had been collapsed into
// one, and the fixtures written from the wrong one asserted upstream's verdict for a reason
// upstream does not hold.
//
// The elimination is not reproduced. It is dead-value analysis over a value graph this tree does
// not build, the divergence costs findings only in code that constructs JSX and then discards it,
// and a linter reporting a discarded `<div />` inside a try is not obviously wrong. **Recorded as a
// real divergence rather than smoothed over**: a differential against a tool running React's
// pipeline will show findings here it does not report, and `assignedJsxNeverReadIsADocumentedDivergence`
// in the fixtures is that case pinned as reporting, with the reasoning at the line.
//
// # Which functions are even eligible, and why that gate is most of the rule
//
// React compiles components and hooks, nothing else, so the validator never sees an ordinary
// function. Measured: `function widget() { let el; try { el = <div />; } catch {} return el; }` is
// **clean**, and the identical body under the name `Component` reports. That gate is not part of
// the fifty two lines, it is the driver's `getReactFunctionType`, and it is load-bearing: dropping
// it would report every try-wrapped JSX in every helper, utility and test file in the tree, a
// false-positive class the imported corpus cannot see because upstream's four fixtures are all
// named `Component`.
//
// The gate reproduced here is upstream's `infer` mode, which is the default `compilationMode`, and
// each clause below was pinned by running the real rule on an input that isolates it:
//
//	name          `/^[A-Z]/` for a component, `/^use[A-Z0-9]/` for a hook. Measured: `_Private`
//	              and `$Dollar` are clean, `usething` is clean, `useThing` reports.
//	position      the function must be found by the program-level traversal, which skips into
//	              nested functions only until it accepts one. Measured: a `Component` declared
//	              inside another function is clean, in both directions of the outer name.
//	creates JSX   `callsHooksOrCreatesJsx`, not counting nested functions. This rule can only fire
//	              on a function containing JSX, so it is satisfied wherever this rule could report
//	              and is not written out separately.
//	params        at most two, no rest element, and a second parameter must mention `ref`.
//	              Measured: `(...props)` is clean, `(props, other)` is clean, `(props, ref)`
//	              reports, `({a, b})` reports.
//	returns       `returnsNonNode`: a function whose LAST-visited return hands back an object, a
//	              function, a class, a `new`, or a bigint is not a component. Upstream **assigns**
//	              rather than accumulating, so the answer is the last return the traversal saw and
//	              not whether any return is a non-node. That is observable and was measured both
//	              ways: `return {}` before `return el` reports, `return el` before `return {}` is
//	              clean, and a function with no return at all reports because the flag never moves.
//
// A hook is gated only on the name and on creating JSX or calling a hook, with no parameter or
// return test, which is upstream's asymmetry rather than an omission here.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// At the JSX construction itself, and this is byte-verified against React's own golden rather than
// inferred. `invalid-jsx-in-try-with-catch.expect.md` logs `"index":123` through `"index":130`;
// slicing that fixture's bytes at those offsets gives `<div />`, seven bytes. `ctx.ReportNode` on
// the element node reproduces exactly that span, probed on this parser before the rule was written.
// A nested element reports separately from its parent, so `<div><span /></div>` inside a try
// produces two findings, which was measured rather than assumed and is why the walk visits every
// JSX node rather than only outermost ones.
//
// # A nested function is a barrier in both directions
//
// JSX inside a function written inside a try block does not report, because that inner function is
// lowered as its own unit with its own empty try stack. Measured:
// `try { const f = () => <div />; f(); } catch {}` is clean, while the `<Inner />` written in the
// same try block does report. So the upward walk stops at the first enclosing function, and the
// gate is asked of that function rather than of the outermost one.
