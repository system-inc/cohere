// directMutationStateFile is where the fixtures pretend to live.

// A `.tsx` suffix because upstream gates the whole rule on `source_type().is_jsx()` and most of the
// imported cases carry JSX in a render method, which would not parse otherwise. The suffix is also
// what the rule itself reads to reproduce that gate, so a fixture in a `.ts` file would go silent
// for the right reason and assert nothing.
const directMutationStateFile = "/repository/source/DirectMutationState.tsx"

// The corpus is oxc's, copied rather than rewritten.
//
// Every case in the two upstream tests below is verbatim from
// `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/no_direct_mutation_state.rs`, checked byte against byte by
// a script that asserted each extracted string appears in the Rust source rather than by reading
// them. The extractor reported one tester block, 8 pass and 15 fail, no case carrying options, and
// a DISCREPANCY: 22 diagnostics against 15 fail inputs.
//
// That discrepancy is real rather than a second-snapshot artifact. There is one snapshot file and
// its 22 location headers partition over the 15 inputs uniquely, because diagnostics appear in
// input order and every fail input reports at least once: the first case writes to state three
// times, the fifth twice, the last five times, and the remaining twelve once each. The partition
// was checked against the source line each diagnostic prints rather than by counting alone.
//
// So `wantSpans` below carries one entry per expected finding, in order, and its length is the
// finding count. That is deliberate: `ExpectFindings` asserts ids and count and nothing else, and
// this rule's whole subject is which sub-expression a write is rooted at, which only a span can see.

// TestNoDirectMutationStateFires is upstream's fail corpus.
//
// `wantSpans` is the text the upstream snapshot underlines for each diagnostic, in order, extracted
// from the snapshot mechanically rather than transcribed. Two different spans live in here and the
// difference is the rule's own: an assignment reports its left-hand side alone, while an update
// expression reports the whole expression including the operator. `this.state.foo` against
// `this.state.foo++` is that difference, and no message-id assertion can see it.
