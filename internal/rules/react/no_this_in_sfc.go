// Ported from `react/no-this-in-sfc`, read against oxc's `no_this_in_sfc.rs` and the three helpers
// it calls: `is_es5_component` and `is_es6_component` (`oxc_linter/src/utils/react.rs:556`, `:577`)
// and `is_react_component_name` (`:784`). ESLint's `eslint-plugin-react` source is in this tree and
// was read as a second opinion. It carries `schema: []`, which is the authoritative statement that
// this rule takes no options, and oxc deserializes nothing, so the two agree and this takes none.
//
// The two implementations differ in a way worth stating, and oxc wins because oxc is what the
// differential gate runs. ESLint anchors on `MemberExpression` and reports the WHOLE member
// expression, routing the component question through its `Components` detector, which tracks
// returned JSX and would recognize a `memo` or `forwardRef` wrapper. oxc anchors on the
// `ThisExpression` and reports just the four characters of `this`, and its component test is purely
// syntactic. The upstream snapshot underlines `this` alone on all fifteen findings, confirming the
// span, and the syntactic test is reproduced below rather than ESLint's semantic one.
//
// # What counts as a stateless function component, which is the whole rule
//
// This is where a port of this rule goes wrong, so it is measured on the release oxlint binary
// rather than reasoned about. The test is syntactic and much narrower than the name suggests.
// A function qualifies when, and only when, a NAME can be read off it whose first character is
// ASCII-uppercase, and the name is read from exactly two places:
//
//	function Foo(p) { ... }                REPORTS   a function's own id
//	const Foo = function Bar(p) { ... }    REPORTS   still the id; the variable is not consulted
//	const Foo = function (p) { ... }       SILENT    an anonymous function expression has no id
//	const Foo = function bar(p) { ... }    SILENT    the id is lowercase, the variable is ignored
//	const Foo = (p) => ...                 REPORTS   an arrow reads its variable declarator instead
//	let Foo = (p) => ...                   REPORTS   any binding kind
//	function foo(p) { ... }                SILENT    lowercase
//	function _Foo(p) { ... }               SILENT    underscore is not uppercase
//	const $Foo = (p) => ...                SILENT    nor is a dollar sign
//	function useFoo() { ... }              SILENT    a hook is not a component here
//
// **Returning JSX is not part of the test at all.** `function Foo(props) { return this.props.a; }`
// reports with no JSX anywhere in it, and upstream's own failing corpus contains such a case. A
// port that gated on "returns JSX" would pass most fixtures and silence this one.
//
// **No wrapper is recognized.** All three of these are SILENT on the release binary, because the
// arrow's parent is a call argument rather than a variable declarator, so no name can be read:
//
//	const Foo = memo((props) => this.props.a)
//	const Foo = React.memo((props) => this.props.a)
//	const Foo = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => this.props.a)
//
// The same reasoning silences an object property (`{ Foo: (p) => ... }`), a destructured binding,
// and a default export of an anonymous arrow. None of these is in the corpus; all were measured.
// That is upstream being crude rather than upstream being right, and it is reproduced rather than
// improved on, because a differential run against oxlint is what this has to survive.
//
// # The name test is ASCII, and the shelf helper is not
//
// `internal/utilities/react.IsLikelyComponentName` is exactly the shape this reaches for and is wrong
// for it. Its body is `unicode.IsUpper(runes[0])`, which is Unicode-wide; oxc's
// `is_react_component_name` is `c.is_ascii_uppercase()`. Measured on the release binary, all three
// of `function Фoo`, `function Λoo` and `function Éoo` reading `this.props.a` are SILENT upstream,
// while the shelf helper answers true for every one of them and would report all three. The
// predicate below is ASCII-only for that reason. Read the body, not the name.
//
// # Which construct rebinds `this`, measured rather than inferred from the language
//
// JavaScript semantics say a nested `function` rebinds `this` and a nested arrow does not, and
// upstream happens to agree, but it reaches that answer through two separate mechanisms that do not
// line up with the language and have to be reproduced separately.
//
// The first is the ancestor walk. It runs from the `this` outward and stops at the first function
// it meets. A `Function` ancestor ends the walk unconditionally, answering with itself only when it
// is component-named. An arrow ancestor that is NOT component-named is stepped over and the walk
// continues upward, which is what lets an anonymous callback inside a component still belong to
// that component. Measured:
//
//	function Foo(p) { const cb = () => this.props.a; }    REPORTS   arrow steps over
//	function Foo(p) { function cb() { this.props.a; } }   SILENT    fn stops the walk
//	function Foo(p) { const cb = function () { this.props.a; }; }  SILENT   anonymous fn, same
//	function Foo(p) { const Cb = () => this.props.a; }    REPORTS   the inner arrow is the component
//	function Foo(p) { return { m() { return this.props.a; } }; }   SILENT   a method is a Function
//
// The second is a separate exemption pass over the ancestors BETWEEN the `this` and the component
// that was found, which exempts a `Function`, a method, a property definition, and an accessor
// property whose value contains the `this`. The two overlap on nested functions and disagree
// nowhere the corpus reaches, but both are reproduced because each catches cases the other does
// not: a class body nested inside an arrow component is caught only by the second.
//
// # The accessor split, which our AST spells differently
//
// oxc has two node kinds where we have one. Its `PropertyDefinition` exempts unconditionally, and
// its `AccessorProperty` exempts only when the value's span contains the `this`. TypeScript's AST
// models both as `KindPropertyDeclaration`, distinguished by an accessor modifier. Measured, and
// the two rows genuinely differ:
//
//	function Foo() { class C { accessor h = () => this.value; } }    SILENT   this is in the value
//	function Foo() { class C { accessor [this.props.n] = 0; } }      REPORTS  a computed KEY is not
//	function Foo() { class C { h = () => this.value; } }             SILENT   plain, unconditional
//	function Foo() { class C { [this.props.n] = 0; } }               SILENT   plain, unconditional
//
// Both accessor rows are in upstream's corpus, one passing and one failing, so this split is the
// one part of the exemption the imported fixtures can actually see. `ast.HasAccessorModifier` is
// what picks the arm.
//
// # The class-component ancestor exemption, and the strict factory name
//
// After a component is found, upstream walks that component's own ancestors and exempts if any is
// an ES5 or ES6 React component. So an arrow component defined inside a class component's method
// is exempt, while the same arrow inside a plain class reports. Measured on all seven heritage
// spellings: `React.Component`, `React.PureComponent`, bare `Component` and bare `PureComponent`
// exempt, and `Foo.Component`, `Base` and a class with no extends clause do not.
//
// The ES5 half is where the shelf is wrong in the other direction.
// `internal/utilities/react.IsEs5ComponentCall` accepts `createClass` and `React.createClass` as well
// as `createReactClass`, while oxc keys both arms of `is_es5_component` on the single constant
// `CREATE_CLASS = "createReactClass"`. Measured on the release binary, an arrow component holding a
// `this` read inside `createReactClass({...})` is SILENT while the same thing inside
// `createClass({...})` and inside `React.createClass({...})` both REPORT. Following the shelf
// helper's name instead of its body would silence two cases upstream reports, and no imported
// fixture could see it because the corpus never nests a component inside an ES5 factory. This
// calls `isEs5ComponentCallStrict` in `no_did_mount_set_state.go`, which is that same narrowing
// measured there for the same reason.
//
// Upstream's own passing corpus contains `const Foo = React.createClass({ render: function () {
// return <div>{this.props.foo}</div>; } });`, which looks like it is passing because of this
// exemption and is not. It passes because `render: function ()` is an ANONYMOUS function
// expression, so no name can be read, the walk ends at the `Function` arm and answers nothing. The
// case would pass identically with the factory removed, which was measured. A port that read that
// fixture as evidence about the factory name would draw exactly the wrong conclusion, which is why
// the narrowing above rests on the probe rather than on the corpus.
//
// # Parentheses, measured because no imported fixture writes one
//
// The anchor requires the `this`'s immediate parent to be a member expression, with no
// paren-skipping anywhere. Measured on the release binary:
//
//	this.props.foo        REPORTS   the control
//	(this.props).foo      REPORTS   the parens are outside the member expression
//	(this).props.foo      SILENT    the parent is a parenthesized expression, not a member
//	((this)).props.foo    SILENT    the same
//	this["props"].foo     REPORTS   a computed member counts, and is in the corpus
//	this                  SILENT    a bare `this` with no member access at all
//	this()                SILENT    a call is not a member expression
//
// Our tree keeps parentheses as a real `KindParenthesizedExpression` node in exactly the places
// oxc does, confirmed by dumping the ancestor chain for both forms, so a plain parent-kind check
// with no `SkipParentheses` reproduces all seven rows. Adding the paren-skip that usually reads as
// a free correctness improvement would report two cases oxlint is silent on. All are pinned below.
