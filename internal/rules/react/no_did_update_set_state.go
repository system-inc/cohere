// NoDidUpdateSetStateOptions is the decoded option object.

// One field holding the single positional string both upstreams take. ESLint's `meta.schema` is
// `[{enum: ["disallow-in-func"]}]`, so upstream accepts exactly one value and treats its absence as
// the permissive default it spells `allow-in-func` internally. oxc deserializes the same position
// into an enum carrying `allowed` and `disallow-in-func`, so `allowed` is an oxc extension that
// names the default explicitly, and upstream's own corpus passes it on four cases. Both spellings
// are accepted here for that reason and only `disallow-in-func` changes an answer.
//
// Our inventory records this rule as taking no options, which is wrong, and this is the second
// react rule in this package where that column has been wrong.

	// one that cannot start reporting on a typo in somebody's settings file.

//	invalid: the callback case above, under `disallow-in-func`
//
// Ported from `react/no-did-update-set-state`, read against oxc's `no_did_update_set_state.rs` and
// the shared `function_count_before_lifecycle_component` it calls, against `eslint-plugin-react`'s
// `makeNoMethodSetStateRule` factory, and measured on the release oxlint binary for every shape our
// abstract syntax tree spells differently than oxc's does.
//
// # What the rule actually decides, which is narrower than its name and wider than it reads
//
// Three conditions, all syntactic. There is no call-graph analysis anywhere in either upstream, and
// that is the thing most likely to be assumed: a helper method that calls `setState`, invoked from
// the lifecycle method, is silent at both tools and is silent here. Only ancestry counts.
//
//	the callee is `this.setState`, by member access of either spelling
//	walking outward reaches a property or method named `componentDidUpdate`
//	and continuing outward from there reaches a React component
//
// The nesting judgment sits on top: the walk counts function-like ancestors passed before reaching
// the lifecycle name, and by default declines when that count exceeds one. A call written directly
// in the method body passes one function, which is the method itself. A call in a callback passes
// two. `disallow-in-func` drops the count check and reports at any depth.
//
// # The two conditions being independent is upstream behavior, and it is the surprise here
//
// Nothing checks that the lifecycle-named property and the component are related. A plain object
// literal carrying a `componentDidUpdate` property, declared anywhere inside any component, reports
// as though it were that component's own lifecycle method. Measured on the release binary rather
// than inferred, because the loop reads as though it were checking a component's method and is not:
// it latches on a name match and then returns at the first component above it, however far away and
// whatever lies between.
//
// The inverse also holds and is the difference from ESLint. ESLint's factory matches the
// lifecycle-named property and stops, so it reports on a class extending nothing and on a bare
// object literal at the top level of a file. oxc requires the component and is silent on both.
// Reproduced oxc's answer, because oxc is what the differential gate compares against, and the
// three clean fixtures covering it are ours rather than upstream's.
//
// # Why the ES5 component predicate is spelled here rather than taken from the shelf
//
// `utilsreact.IsEs5ComponentCall` looks like exactly this question and answers a wider one. It
// accepts `createClass` and `React.createClass` as well as `createReactClass`, matching a different
// oxc helper, while `is_es5_component`, which is the one this rule reaches, accepts only the name
// `createReactClass`. Measured: both of the wider spellings are clean on the release binary, so
// reaching for the shelf would have reported where upstream is silent, and no imported fixture
// covers either spelling so nothing would have caught it.
//
// That is the third time in this package a react helper has been correct for the rule that
// motivated it and wrong for a neighbour that asks a question of the same shape. The ES6 half does
// match, and `utilsreact.IsEs6ComponentClass` is used for it rather than copied.
//
// # Reading a property key cannot go through Text()
//
// A computed key is a `ComputedPropertyName` and `Node.Text()` panics on it outright, so the key is
// resolved with `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName`, which checks kind before reading and answers a
// boolean for the keys that name nothing statically. That is the shim's spelling of oxc's
// `static_name()` and it resolves the same three shapes: an identifier, a string literal, and a
// computed key holding one. All three measured reporting on the release binary, so a port matching
// only the identifier spelling loses two real findings and crashes on a third input.

// passed before a property named for the lifecycle method was reached, and whether a React
// component was reached after that. The boolean is false when either never happens, which is one
// return value in oxc's `Option<usize>` and two here because Go has no such shape without a pointer.
//
// # Three details that each look like a detail and are not
//
// **Counting stops at the first name match.** Once the lifecycle name is seen, further functions on
// the way out are not counted. A lifecycle-named property nested inside the real lifecycle method
// therefore has a count of one and reports in the default mode, which was measured rather than
// reasoned about because continuing to count would have made it two and silent.
//
// **The count includes the lifecycle method's own function.** A call written directly in the body
// passes exactly one, which is why the threshold is `> 1` rather than `> 0`. That holds across all
// three ways the method can be written: a `MethodDeclaration`, an object property whose value is a
// function expression, and a class property whose value is an arrow. In the last of those, the
// arrow is passed before the property that names it, which is what keeps the three consistent.
//
// **The name is read with the kind-checked resolver.** `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName` answers for an
// identifier, a string literal and a computed key holding a literal, and answers false rather than
// panicking on an interpolated computed key. Reading `Text()` here crashes the linter on the first
// `{[k]: v}` in the tree.
