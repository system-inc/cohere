		"throws on any current React. Even where it still runs it reaches around the " +
		"component that owns the node: the parent reads a child's DOM element the child " +
		"never agreed to expose, so the child cannot change what it renders without " +
		"breaking a caller it does not know about. Pass a ref to the element instead, so " +
		"the component decides what it hands out.",

// NoFindDOMNode flags a call to `findDOMNode`, bare or through a React namespace.
//
//	valid:   var Hello = function() {};
//	valid:   this.someFunc = React.findDOMNode;
//	valid:   SomeModule.findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
//	valid:   React.someFunc(this);
//	invalid: findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
//	invalid: ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this);
//
// Ported from `react/no-find-dom-node`, read against oxc's `no_find_dom_node.rs`. There is no
// readable `eslint-plugin-react` source for this one in the tree to compare against, so oxc is the
// only implementation consulted, and every claim below that is not visible in the eleven imported
// cases was measured by running the release oxlint binary on a probe file rather than reasoned out.
//
// # This is a syntactic rule and it resolves nothing
//
// The obvious reading of the name is that the rule finds calls to *React's* `findDOMNode`, which
// would need to know where the callee came from and therefore need the checker. It does not ask
// that, and declaring the checker here would be wrong on cost and wrong on behavior.
//
// oxc's `run` reads only `call_expr.callee`. It never touches `ctx.scoping()`, never resolves a
// reference to a declaration, and never looks at the imports. Two measurements pin that this is
// upstream's behavior and not an omission in the reading:
//
//	function f(findDOMNode) { findDOMNode(this); }        reports, though it is a parameter
//	import { findDOMNode as f } from 'react-dom'; f(this) silent, though it IS React's function
//
// The first is a local binding that has nothing to do with React and it reports; the second is
// genuinely React's `findDOMNode` under another name and it is silent. So the rule is a check on
// the *spelling at the call site*, and any port that resolves the identifier would disagree with
// the gate in both directions. The one imported case with a `demo.ts` filename and a real
// `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'` is therefore testing nothing about the import: the same source
// with the import line deleted reports identically.
//
// # Two shapes, and the receiver set is closed
//
// A bare identifier callee reports on the name alone, which is oxc's
// `callee.get_identifier_reference()` arm. Note that arm's unconditional `return`: once the callee
// is an identifier, a non-matching name falls out of the rule entirely rather than continuing to
// the member check. That cannot change an answer, since an identifier is not a member expression,
// but it is why the code below is a switch rather than two sequential checks.
//
// A member callee reports only when the object is one of exactly three identifiers, `React`,
// `ReactDOM` or `ReactDom`. This is the discrimination `react.IsNamespacedMember` looks built for
// and cannot serve: that helper hardcodes the receiver as `React` alone, by design and with a
// documented reason, so it answers no for `ReactDOM.findDOMNode` and would drop two thirds of the
// imported fail cases. The shelf was read before this was written rather than after; using it here
// would have been a name match rather than a semantic one. Casing is exact, measured:
// `reactdom.findDOMNode(this)` is silent.
//
// The object must be the receiver *directly*. `a.ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this)` and
// `getReactDOM().findDOMNode(this)` are both silent on the release binary, because oxc's
// `is_specific_id` asks whether the object node is that identifier rather than whether its text
// ends in it.
//
// # Where the finding points, including the case that is easy to get wrong
//
// The span is the *name*, never the call and never the member expression. That is `ident.span` in
// the identifier arm and `static_property_info()`'s span in the member arm, and the imported
// snapshot confirms it at eleven columns wide on all six findings.
//
// The subscript form is the trap. `ReactDOM["findDOMNode"](this)` reports on `"findDOMNode"` *with
// the quotes*, thirteen bytes rather than eleven, because `static_property_info` hands back the
// literal node's own span rather than the name inside it. Same for a template subscript and its
// backticks. Nothing in the imported corpus writes a subscript at all, so this is pinned by an
// invented span assertion below; a port reporting the cooked name would be off by one on each side
// and every message-id fixture would still pass.
//
// # What is skipped and what is not
//
// Parentheses are skipped on both the callee and the object, which is the opposite of the sibling
// `no-is-mounted` in this package and is upstream's behavior rather than a preference here. oxc
// reaches the callee through `get_identifier_reference()` and `get_member_expr()`, both of which
// unwrap parenthesized expressions, and `is_specific_id` unwraps the object. Measured on all three:
// `(findDOMNode)(this)`, `(ReactDOM).findDOMNode(this)` and `((ReactDOM)).findDOMNode(this)` all
// report, and each finding still points at the bare name.
//
// Optional chaining reports in both positions, `ReactDOM?.findDOMNode(this)` and
// `findDOMNode?.(this)`, since neither changes the callee's kind in our tree.
//
// A `new findDOMNode(this)` is silent, because upstream anchors on `CallExpression` and a `new` is a
// different node. That is upstream being narrow rather than upstream being right, and it is
// reproduced rather than improved on, because a differential run against oxlint is what this port
// has to survive.
var NoFindDOMNode = rule.Rule{
	// No namespace prefix. The config writes `react/no-find-dom-node` and the parity guard strips
