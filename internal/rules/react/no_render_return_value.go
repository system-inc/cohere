// Ported from `react/no-render-return-value`, read against oxc's `no_render_return_value.rs` and
// measured against the release oxlint binary on inputs the imported corpus does not contain.
//
// # This is not a use analysis, and reading it as one is the way to get it wrong
//
// The name and the message both say "return value", which invites the implementation everybody
// reaches for first: decide whether the call's result is consumed. That implementation is wrong in
// both directions and the imported corpus cannot tell you so, because upstream's eight fail cases
// are exactly the five parent kinds and nothing else.
//
// What upstream actually asks is whether the call's immediate parent is one of five node kinds. So
// these all consume the return value in any ordinary reading, and every one of them is silent,
// measured on oxlint rather than reasoned:
//
//	foo(ReactDOM.render(<div />, x));        an argument
//	ReactDOM.render(<div />, x).foo;         a property read off the result
//	if (ReactDOM.render(<div />, x)) {}      a condition
//	ReactDOM.render(<div />, x) === null;    a comparison
//	`${ReactDOM.render(<div />, x)}`;        a template interpolation
//	[ReactDOM.render(<div />, x)];           an array element
//
// A port inferring its parent set from what counts as a use reports all six, passes all seventeen
// upstream cases while doing so, and is wrong on the tree. The set is enumerated from upstream's
// match arm rather than derived, and the six inputs above are pinned as clean fixtures.
//
// # The second check, which the corpus does not exercise at all
//
// Upstream runs a *second*, independent test after the parent-kind one, and it is not a refinement
// of it. If the parent node's enclosing scope is an arrow function whose body is an expression, the
// call reports wherever it sits inside that body. Position stops mattering:
//
//	var d = () => foo(ReactDOM.render(<div />, x));    reports, though the bare form does not
//	var c = () => ReactDOM.render(<div />, x).foo;     reports, though the bare form does not
//
// No upstream input distinguishes this, so a port implementing only the parent-kind list passes the
// entire imported corpus while missing half the rule. It is pinned by invented fixtures instead.
//
// The scope is the *innermost* one, not any ancestor: a function expression inside an arrow body
// starts a new scope and stops the reach, measured silent on oxlint. Our tree has no scope table,
// so the check is spelled as a walk to the nearest function-like ancestor, which answers the same
// question by construction rather than by lookup.
//
// # Where the two checks overlap, upstream reports twice
//
// `() => () => ReactDOM.render(...)` satisfies both at once and oxc diagnoses in both branches with
// no guard against having already reported, so one input produces two identical findings. That is
// reproduced rather than deduplicated: oxlint is the gate this replaces, and collapsing it would
// read as a difference on real code. It looks like an upstream oversight and is pinned by a fixture
// that says so.
//
// # What the receiver must be
//
// `ReactDOM` exactly, as a bare identifier. `React.render` is a deliberate upstream pass, and the
// commented-out fail cases in oxc's own corpus record why: the rule targets React 15 and later,
// where the method moved off `React`. That gap is reproduced rather than improved on.
//
// # No type checker, and adding one would be a divergence rather than a refinement
//
// Every question this rule asks is syntactic, so nothing here declares `NeedsTypeChecker`. Upstream
// calls `ctx.scoping()`, which is not evidence either way: it asks that table only for scope flags
// (`is_arrow`), a property of the enclosing construct the shape of the tree already carries, rather
// than asking which declaration an identifier binds to.
//
// The stronger point is that resolution would make this port *worse*, in both directions at once,
// which was measured rather than reasoned. Upstream matches the spelling `ReactDOM` and never asks
// what it binds to:
//
//	var RD = ReactDOM; var b = RD.render(<div />, x);        silent, in a file importing react-dom
//	function f(ReactDOM) { var c = ReactDOM.render(...); }   reports, though this is a parameter
//
// The first is a real miss the checker would close, and the second is a finding on code that has
// nothing to do with react-dom, which the checker would decline. A resolution-based port therefore
// disagrees with the gate on both, and both are pinned as fixtures so a later helpful correction
// fails loudly. Needing no checker and the checker being unhelpful are separate findings, and this
// rule happens to have both.
//
// `internal/utilities/react.IsNamespacedMember` is the shelf function whose name fits this shape and it
// cannot serve here: it hardcodes its receiver to `React` alone, by documented design and confirmed
// in its body, so it declines every input this rule exists to catch. Its parenthesis-skipping is
// also a divergence here, since oxc matches `Expression::Identifier` against the object directly
// and a parenthesized receiver is a different node there.

//
// Both member spellings answer. `property.AccessedName` reads a dotted access and a subscripted one

// The accept set is stated rather than taken from `property.Textual`, which was the first choice

// Measured on oxlint: it does. A sweep widening the set to `property.Static` survived every fixture, which is
// how the gap was found rather than by reading.
//
// Reading the property text without a kind check would be a crash rather than a wrong answer here.
// `Node.Text()` panics on a `KindComputedPropertyName`, and this rule anchors on the shape most
// likely to meet one, so the read goes through the shelf function that guards it rather than

//
// Widening this to `property.Static` survives every fixture, and that survivor is equivalent rather

// `KindComputedPropertyName` into `Name` at all, reading a property access's name node and an

// excluded for that reason and pinned by a fixture, since nothing upstream writes one.

// node sits in is the innermost function-like ancestor it has, so finding that ancestor and asking
// whether it is an expression-bodied arrow is the same predicate spelled structurally.
//
// The walk stops at the first function-like node rather than continuing, and the stop is
