// Ported from `react/no-string-refs` in `eslint-plugin-react`, which is the implementation that
// defined this rule. Every behavior recorded below was measured by driving the installed build,
// version 7.37.5, through the ESLint Linter API rather than read off the source, because the two
// disagreed about five separate inputs and reading was wrong about all five.
//
// # One rule name, two judgments, and they share almost nothing
//
// The name reads as a single judgment about ref attributes and it is not. Upstream carries two
// message ids, `thisRefsDeprecated` and `stringInRefDeprecated`, and the two halves answer to
// different gates: the `this.refs` half requires an enclosing component and is gated on the React
// version, while the attribute half reads the option, ignores the version, and requires no
// component at all. That asymmetry is measured. A bare `<div ref="hello" />` at the top level of a
// file, inside no component of any kind, reports at every React version, and `this.refs` in a plain
// function does not report at any of them.
//
// Reporting both under one id would pass a fixture set asserting counts, since every upstream input
// that reports twice reports once under each. The ids are what separate them.
//
// # The version gate, which decides whether half this rule runs at all
//
// `create` opens with `testReactVersion(context, '< 18.3.0')`, because `this.refs` became writable
// in React 18.3 and the deprecation no longer applies. When no version is configured,
// `getReactVersionFromContext` falls back to `ULTIMATE_LATEST_SEMVER`, the literal string
// `999.999.999` at `util/version.js:15`, so the predicate is false and the `this.refs` half never
// runs. Auto-detection from `node_modules/react` happens only when the configuration says
// `version: "detect"` explicitly; absence does not trigger it.
//
// Measured on the running rule, one class, five configurations: no settings reports nothing,
// `18.2.0` and `17.0.0` report, `18.3.0` and `19.0.0` report nothing.
//
// Our `internal/config` has no settings surface at all. `Config` carries `Rules`,
// `IgnorePatterns`, `Overrides`, `Plugins` and `Root`, established with a control grep that found
// `Rules` in the same command that found no `Settings`, so no React version can reach a rule here
// by any route. The faithful reading of that is not "pick a version" but "reproduce the answer
// upstream gives under this repository's configuration", and that answer is silence: this tree
// configures no React version, and it runs React 19.2.8, where the deprecation is genuinely not in
// force.
//
// So the half is off by default and reachable by an option this rule adds. Shipping it always-on
// would report on every `this.refs` in the tree where upstream reports on none, and shipping it
// with no way to turn on would delete a judgment upstream still makes for anyone pinned below
// 18.3. The option is named for what it does rather than for a version, because a version string
// this rule cannot obtain would be a promise the config cannot keep.
//
// # There is no file gate, and the previous port had one
//
// This rule was ported once before from oxc, which declares `should_run` on
// `source_type().is_jsx()`. Upstream has no such gate: the same class reports identically under
// `probe.jsx`, `probe.js`, `probe.cjs` and `probe.mjs`. The gate is oxc's own and reproducing it
// costs findings in every `.ts` file, which is most of this tree.
//
// # `this.refs` is the dotted spelling and nothing wider
//
// `isRefsUsage` reads `node.property.name === 'refs'` off a `MemberExpression`, and a computed key
// has no `property.name` unless the key is itself an identifier. So the three computed spellings
// fall out in a way that reads as inconsistent and is exactly what upstream does:
//
//	this.refs        reports
//	this["refs"]     silent    a string literal key has no `.name`
//	this[`refs`]     silent    a template key has no `.name`
//	this[refs]       REPORTS   an identifier key has `.name === "refs"`, and `computed` is never
//	                           checked, so an unrelated variable named `refs` is read as the
//	                           registry
//
// All four measured. The last is an upstream defect and it is reproduced rather than corrected,
// because correcting it silently is the divergence nothing states. The previous oxc-based port had
// this exactly inverted: it reported the two literal-keyed spellings and was silent on the
// identifier-keyed one.
//
// The `refs` read is what reports, not the property taken off it: `this.refs.hello` underlines nine
// characters, so the finding points at `this.refs` and the outer access is left alone. A bare
// `this.refs` with nothing taken off it reports on its own.
//
// Parentheses are transparent here, and that is a parser difference rather than a decision.
// ESLint's ESTree has no parenthesized node, so `(this).refs` is a member expression whose object
// is a `ThisExpression` and it reports, with the finding underlining `(this).refs`. Our parser
// keeps the parenthesis as a real node, so reproducing upstream means skipping it deliberately.
// Measured; the previous port was silent on this input.
//
// # The enclosing component is found by SCOPE, not by walking parents
//
// `getParentES6Component` walks *scopes* to the first `class` scope and asks whether that one class
// is a component. It does not keep climbing. `getParentES5Component` walks scopes upward asking, at
// each one, whether the scope's block is the function argument of a factory call.
//
// The difference from a parent-chain walk is not cosmetic and it runs in both directions:
//
//	class H extends React.Component { m() { class Inner { k() { return this.refs.x; } } } }
//	                 silent upstream. The first class scope is `Inner`, which is not a component,
//	                 and the walk stops there rather than finding `H` above it.
//
//	class Outer { m() { class H extends React.Component { k() { return this.refs.x; } } } }
//	                 reports. The first class scope IS the component.
//
//	var H = createReactClass({ m: this.refs.x });
//	                 silent. The ES5 walk reads `scope.block.parent.parent` at each scope, and with
//	                 no function between the read and the module there is no scope whose block sits
//	                 inside the factory call.
//
// All three measured. `utilsreact.EnclosingComponent` is a parent-chain walk and answers the first
// two the wrong way, so the ES6 half is spelled here as "the nearest enclosing class, and is that
// one a component" rather than reached for from the shelf.
//
// A class field initializer and a static method both report, and an arrow function inside a method
// reports, because an arrow creates no class scope and the walk passes straight through it.
//
// # The ES5 factory is one name, and the shelf accepts three
//
// `isES5Component` keys on the `createClass` pragma, which defaults to `createReactClass`, and
// checks the callee is either that bare identifier or `<pragma>.createReactClass`. So:
//
//	createReactClass({...})          reports
//	React.createReactClass({...})    reports
//	React.createClass({...})         silent
//	createClass({...})               silent
//
// Measured. `utilsreact.IsEs5ComponentCall` accepts `createClass` and `React.createClass` as well,
// via `isCreateClassName`, so reaching for the shelf would report on two shapes upstream is silent
// on, and nothing in the imported corpus writes either. The predicate is spelled locally for that
// reason, which is the same resolution `no-unsafe` in this package reached for the same helper.
//
// `utilsreact.IsEs6ComponentClass` is used as-is, and that is measured rather than assumed. It
// skips parentheses on the heritage receiver, which is a divergence from oxc and is NOT one from
// this authority: `(React.Component)` and `(React).Component` both report upstream, because ESTree
// has no parenthesized node for the check to trip over. Its accepted base names, `Component` and
// `PureComponent` bare or under the React namespace, are `/^(Pure)?Component$/` at
// `componentUtil.js:113` exactly.
//
// The one thing the shelf cannot do is upstream's `isExplicitComponent`, which reads a
// `@extends React.Component` JSDoc tag through doctrine. Measured silent here rather than assumed:
// `/** @extends React.Component */ class H extends Foo {}` does not report on the running rule,
// because that path requires the `componentDetection` option most configurations leave off. Not
// implemented, and recorded here so the absence reads as measured rather than as forgotten.
//
// # The two template shapes, which is where this family of rules has gone wrong before
//
// A template ref has two node kinds in our AST and one in ESTree. “ref={`hello`}” parses as a
// `NoSubstitutionTemplateLiteral` and “ref={`hello${index}`}” as a `TemplateExpression`, where
// upstream sees `TemplateLiteral` for both. Upstream's corpus fails under the option on both
// shapes, so matching only the first would drop a fixture and matching only the second would drop
// two. Both are listed for that reason, and both were measured under the option and with it off.
//
// # What the attribute half will not touch
//
// `containsStringLiteral` requires `node.value.type === 'Literal'` with a string value, so a bare
// `<div ref />` has no value at all and is silent, and `ref={123}` is a Literal whose value is not
// a string. `ref={"a"+"b"}` is a `BinaryExpression` rather than a Literal and is silent even though
// its value is knowable. A spread supplying the ref is not a `JSXAttribute` and is never visited.
// The name comparison is exact, so `<div REF="hello" />` is a different attribute and is silent,
// and a namespaced `xlink:ref` is a `JSXNamespacedName` whose `.name` is an object rather than a
// string. All measured.
//
// The finding underlines the whole attribute, `ref="hello"`, which is the node handed to `report`,
// rather than the name span that `no-children-prop` in this same package reports.
var NoStringRefs = rule.Rule{
	// No namespace prefix. The config writes `react/no-string-refs` and the parity guard strips the

//
