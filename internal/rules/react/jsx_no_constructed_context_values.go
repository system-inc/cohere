// Ported from `react/jsx-no-constructed-context-values` in `eslint-plugin-react`, read from the

// messages; no fixer. Everything recorded below was measured by driving the installed build (7.37.5)
// through the ESLint Linter API rather than reasoned from the source.
//
// # There is no file-suffix gate
//
// Measured under `.tsx`, `.jsx` and `.js`: all three report. There is no `.ts` row because a `.ts`
// file cannot hold JSX, so a gate would be unobservable there rather than absent, which is the
// distinction `self_closing_comp_test.go` records for a different rule.
//
// # Which elements are providers, and the two paths differ
//
// Upstream splits on the tag name's shape and only one half consults anything:
//
//	<X.Provider ...>     the property must be named `Provider`. The object is NEVER checked, so an
//	                     arbitrary `<Whatever.Provider>` reports and `<Whatever.NotProvider>` does
//	                     not. Measured both ways.
//	<X ...>              a bare identifier must resolve to a variable whose initializer is a call to
//	                     `createContext` or `React.createContext`. Measured: a bare `createContext()`
//	                     and the namespaced form both qualify, and any other callee does not.
//
// The second path is why this rule declares the checker. Upstream walks its own scope chain;
// `GetSymbolAtLocation` on the tag name answers the same question, and a probe confirmed it
// resolves to the `KindVariableDeclaration` with its `KindCallExpression` initializer intact.
//
// # The enclosing component test, measured across twenty shapes before this was written
//
// Upstream calls `utils.getParentComponent(node)`, which is the plugin's 959-line component
// detector. That detector is not in this tree, and reproducing it would be a substrate build rather
// than a rule port. It does not have to be reproduced here, and the reason is specific to this rule:
// the node being classified is ALREADY a JSX element, so every question the detector would ask
// about whether a function returns JSX is answered before it is asked. What is left is the name and
// the class heritage.
//
// So the classifier below was written as a hypothesis and probed against the installed build on
// twenty shapes before any of it went into the rule. All twenty agree:
//
//	function Component() {...}                       REPORTS   named, capitalized
//	function component() {...}                       silent    named, lowercase
//	Component() { helper() { ... } }                 silent    the NEAREST function decides
//	helper() { Component() { ... } }                 REPORTS   the nearest one again
//	Component() { const inner = () => ... }          silent    nearest is `inner`
//	const Component = () => ...                      REPORTS   the arrow borrows its binding
//	const component = () => ...                      silent
//	const thing = function Component() {...}         silent    the BINDING decides, not the
//	const Component = function thing() {...}         REPORTS   function expression's own name
//	class C extends React.Component { render() {} }  REPORTS   the class heritage decides
//	class C extends React.Component { other() {} }   REPORTS   any member, not just render
//	class C { render() {} }                          silent    no heritage
//	class C extends Foo.Bar { render() {} }          silent    not a React base
//	class c extends React.Component { render() {} }  REPORTS   class NAME is irrelevant
//	class C extends React.Component { f = () => }    REPORTS   a class field belongs to the class
//	class Thing { Render() {} }                      silent    a capitalized method is not enough
//	<top level>                                      silent    no enclosing function at all
//	React.memo(() => ...)                            REPORTS   the wrapper is transparent
//	React.forwardRef(() => ...)                      REPORTS
//
// Two of those rows are where the shelf disagrees with upstream and this rule cannot use it
// directly. `scope.NameOf` prefers a function expression's OWN name over its binding, which is the
// opposite of rows eight and nine; and it answers a method's name, where rows ten through sixteen
// show the class is what decides. Both are correct for the rules `scope.NameOf` was lifted from and
// wrong here, so the walk below is written out rather than delegated. That is a divergence in
// mechanism only, and the twenty rows are the evidence for it.
//
// # What counts as a construction
//
// Upstream's `isConstruction` is a recursive switch over the value expression. Every kind was
// measured; the interesting rows are the ones that recurse rather than answer:
//
//	{a:1} [1] () => {} function(){} class{} new F() /x/ <div/> <></>   report directly
//	c ? {a:1} : x          reports, on whichever branch constructs, LEFT first
//	x || {a:1}             the same, over both sides
//	o.a                    recurses into the OBJECT, and reports with the object as the usage
//	v = {a:1}              recurses into the right side, kind becomes `assignment expression`
//	({a:1} as any)         unwraps the assertion and reports the inner object
//	makeIt() "s" 1 `t` x   silent: a call result is not something this rule can judge
//
// An identifier recurses into what it was declared as, so `const v = {a:1}` reports with `v` as the
// usage and the object as the node. A function declaration is its own construction. A parameter is
// silent, which upstream spells as a bail-out on any definition that is not a variable or a
// function name.
//
// # Where the finding points, and it is not the value expression
//
// Every finding is anchored on the CONSTRUCTION, which for an indirect case is somewhere else
// entirely: `const v = {x:1}` two lines above the provider reports on `{x:1}`, not on `v`. Measured
// by slicing the reported range on twenty-six inputs. A message-id fixture cannot see this and the
// corpus does not assert it, so the span cases below do.
//
// # One message this rule can produce that upstream's corpus never exercises
//
// `defaultMsgFunc` appears in none of the twenty-three failing cases, though the rule can plainly
// emit it and does: an inline arrow reports it, measured. The corpus reaching only three of four
// ids is upstream's gap, not a statement that the fourth is unreachable.
