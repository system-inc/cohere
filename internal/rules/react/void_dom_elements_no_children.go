// Sixteen names, upstream's `VOID_DOM_ELEMENTS` verbatim and in the same order. This is the rule's

// element while every other fixture stayed green. Upstream's corpus exercises only `br` and `img`,
// so fourteen of the sixteen have no imported coverage and are pinned by a test written here.
//
// A map rather than a slice because the lookup is the rule's inner loop and a map states that the
// order carries no meaning. Built once at package initialisation rather than per file, which is the
// shape a rule that rebuilt a map per file was measured costing most of a lint run.

//
// Ported from `react/void-dom-elements-no-children`, read against oxc's
// `void_dom_elements_no_children.rs`. The corpus is 12 passing and 10 failing inputs from that
// file's single tester block, and the snapshot carries 10 diagnostics, exactly one per failing
// input, so there was no per-input count to recover. The rule takes no options: upstream declares
// no configuration struct and no case in the corpus carries a second tuple element.
//
// # Children arrive four ways and the rule counts rather than reads
//
// Content between the tags, a `children` attribute, a `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute, and the
// third and later arguments of a `createElement` call. The danger prop belongs in that list because
// it sets the element's content just as children do, which is why upstream compares against both
// names at both sites rather than only against `children`.
//
// The JSX half asks whether the children list is non-empty and never looks at what a child holds.
// That is narrower reading than it sounds and it cuts the other way from the sibling rule beside
// it: `<br>` written across two lines reports, because the formatting newline between the tags is a
// JsxText node, and `<br>{}</br>` reports because an empty expression container is a node too.
// `no-danger-with-children` filters exactly that shape out through `ast.IsWhitespaceOnlyJsxText`,
// and reaching for the same predicate here because the neighbouring rule has it would make this
// rule silent on inputs upstream reports. Measured on the release oxlint binary rather than
// reasoned about: `<br>\n</br>` and `<br>{}</br>` each report once, while `<br></br>` is silent.
//
// # The element list is compared exactly, and that is a judgment rather than an oversight
//
// `<BR>`, `<Br>` and `<Img>` are all silent, measured on the release binary. Upstream compares
// against a lowercase list with no folding, and it is right rather than merely faithful: JSX
// resolves a capitalized tag to a component binding in scope, so `<Img>` renders whatever that name
// is bound to, which is not the void HTML element and may legitimately take children. A port that
// folded case would report on component references.
//
// # A spread is seen and deliberately declined
//
// The natural reading of a rule that misses spreads is that spreads are invisible, and here that
// reading is wrong. A JSX spread is a `JsxSpreadAttribute` in the same properties list and a
// spread property is a `SpreadAssignment` in the same object literal, so both are perfectly visible
// to a listener that looks for them. Upstream looks and answers false, at both sites, matching
// `JSXAttributeItem::SpreadAttribute(_) => false` and `ObjectPropertyKind::SpreadProperty(_) =>
// false`. The decline is reproduced because reading a spread means deciding what an arbitrary
// expression evaluates to, and this rule declares no type checker precisely because it never has to
// ask. The sibling `no-danger-with-children` does resolve spreads and does declare one, which is
// the difference between the two rules rather than an inconsistency in either.
//
// So `<br {...{children: 1}} />` is silent here and on the release binary, and it is a real input
// rather than a hypothetical. Upstream's corpus does carry the case proving a spread does not stop
// the search either: `<img {...props} children='Foo' />` reports, because the written attribute
// beside the spread still answers.
//
// # Only a static identifier key answers in the props object
//
// Upstream matches `PropertyKey::StaticIdentifier` alone, so `{'children': 'Foo'}` and
// `{['children']: 'Foo'}` are both silent even though both name the prop unambiguously. That is
// narrower than the rest of this package, which reads keys through `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName`
// and therefore resolves a quoted key and a computed key holding a literal. The narrowness is
// upstream's and is reproduced here deliberately, because reaching for the house helper would widen
// the rule past upstream on two inputs no imported fixture covers. Established by running
// `oxlint --config` with `{"plugins":["react"],"rules":{"react/void-dom-elements-no-children":"error"}}`
// over both spellings and reading zero findings, with a known-failing control in the same run.
//
// # The callee test is the shared helper here, unlike the rule beside it
//
// This rule calls oxc's shared `is_create_element_call`, so a bare `createElement(...)`, a computed
// `React["createElement"](...)` and any object other than React all count, while
// `document.createElement` is excluded by name. `no-danger-with-children` writes a narrower test
// inline because upstream writes a narrower test inline *there*, so the two rules genuinely look at
// different sets of calls and `utilsreact.IsCreateElementCall` is the right helper for this one.
//
// One difference had to be handled rather than inherited. Our helper runs `ast.SkipParentheses`
// over the callee and upstream does not: `is_create_element_call` matches the callee directly
// against three expression variants, and a parenthesized expression is none of them, so it reaches
// the `_ => false` arm. Measured rather than assumed, because the brief makes measuring parens
// mandatory and guessing here would have shipped a divergence in either direction:
// `(React.createElement)('br', {}, 'Foo')` and `(createElement)('br', {}, 'Foo')` are both silent on
// the release binary while both unparenthesized forms report. The callee's kind is therefore
// checked here before the helper is consulted, which reproduces upstream's fall-through without
// restating which three spellings are accepted. The helper is left alone: other rules in this
// package depend on its current behavior, and this is a difference between callers rather than a
// defect in it.
