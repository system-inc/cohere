// The imported corpus is twelve cases and every case here was RUN before being written down.
//
// oxc's linter rule ships a tester block of exactly one pass and one fail, and that floor is
// misleading rather than small: `set_state_in_effect.rs` is the twenty-two-rule dispatcher body, so
// its judgment lives in `oxc_react_compiler` and its real corpus is that crate's `fixtures/`
// directory. Eighteen fixtures there name this rule's behaviour and twelve are transcribed below
// verbatim. A porter who trusts the extractor's confident "1 pass, 1 fail" ports a name heuristic.
//
// React ships no `EffectSetState` golden among the 325 vendored at `internal/reactconformance`.
// Searched for both message texts and for the category name; the zero is real, established with
// three controls in the same command that DID fire: 13 files matching the useMemo setState message,
// 21 matching `setState` at all, 14 containing `useEffect`. The `setState`-named goldens there
// belong to `set-state-in-render` and to `use-memo`, which is the "an error-named fixture can be
// exactly the wrong half" trap.
//
// Every non-imported case was measured by running React 7.1.1's own `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
// through the ESLint Linter API on that exact input, before it was written here. Reading gave the
// wrong answer twice: on which names count as effects, where the neighbouring `exhaustive-deps`
// regex is a trap, and on a function defined inside the effect body, which reads like it must
// report and does not.
//
// # Why these fixtures carry a react.d.ts and upstream's do not
//
// oxc's compiler fixtures mostly do not import react, so `useState` is a bare undeclared global.
// That is exactly why oxc infers from shape: it has no types to read. This rule reads types, so a
// fixture without the import is not a harder version of the same question, it is a different
// question whose answer is `any`, and the rule is correctly silent on it. Probed directly: with no
// import, `useState`, `useEffect` and `setState` all come back as `any` with no symbol at all.
//
// Rather than score near zero against a corpus written for a different mechanism, each case runs
// through `RunTypedFiles` against the stub below, whose declarations are copied from the real
// `@types/react`: `useState` at index.d.ts:1689, `Dispatch` at 1645, `useEffect` at 1785,
// `useLayoutEffect` at 1775, `useInsertionEffect` at 1915, `useRef` at 1737, `RefObject` at 154.
// The CASE TEXT is upstream's byte for byte; only the module specifier moves, from 'react' to
// "./react", and a script verified every remaining line against the upstream file rather than a
// reading of it.
//
// The trade is stated plainly because it is this rule's central design decision: a dependency on
// `@types/react` and typed props, instead of a builtin shape registry and a unification pass. Good
// for application code, weaker against a corpus that omits its imports.

// reactStub is a faithful subset of `@types/react`, not an invention.
//
// Only the declarations this rule's predicates read are present, and each is copied from the real
// file rather than approximated, because the whole rule rests on `Dispatch` being an ALIAS and
// `RefObject` being an INTERFACE. A stub that made either the other kind would test the opposite of
// what ships.

// TestSetStateInEffectSeesThroughManualMemoization pins the `useCallback` / `useMemo` erasure.

// This was found by differential run rather than by reading: `s l --linter both` over Kirk's tree
// had React reporting one finding this rule did not. Reduced, the difference was one wrapper:
//
//	const bump = useCallback(() => setState(1), []);  // React reports, this was silent
//	const bump = () => setState(1);                   // both report
//	useEffect(() => { bump(); });
//
// Both spellings were run through React 7.1.1 via the ESLint Linter API, not inferred. The
// mechanism is upstream's pipeline rather than its validator: `dropManualMemoization`
// (`Pipeline.ts:169`) rewrites `useCallback(fn, deps)` to a plain load of `fn` and
// `useMemo(fn, deps)` to `fn()`, and `validateNoSetStateInEffects` runs at line 50131 of the same
// bundle, long after. So upstream's validator never sees a memo call at all, and this rule --
// transcribed faithfully from that validator -- was faithful to a function whose input had not
// been prepared the same way.
//
// The fix is entirely in the input: `hir.ForFunctionWithoutManualMemoization` runs the erasure
// before this rule reads the graph. The rule itself is unchanged, because it already carries
// setter-ness across `LoadLocal`, which is exactly what the `useCallback` rewrite produces.
//
// # Why the async cases are here
//
// The site that exposed this is a mount fetch whose setters all run after an `await`, so the
// obvious reading is that the await boundary is what upstream is tracking. It is not: `asyncAfterAwait`
// and `asyncBeforeAwait` below differ only in where the setter sits relative to the first await,
// React reports both, and so does this. The await is not consulted by either implementation. That
// is recorded because it is the wrong conclusion a reader is most likely to draw from the site,
// and because it is the one that would send someone rewriting application code to no effect.

// # The useMemo-returns-a-function case is a known divergence, not an oversight
//
// `const bump = useMemo(() => () => setState(1), [])` is reported by React and is silent here, and
// the reason is one pass further down upstream's pipeline. The erasure rewrites `useMemo(fn, deps)`
// to `fn()`, which leaves a call whose result is the inner closure; upstream then runs
// `InlineImmediatelyInvokedFunctionExpressions` immediately afterwards, which replaces that call
// with the closure itself and is what puts a `FunctionExpression` where the validator can see it.
// This tree has no such pass -- `invoked_functions.go` is the analysis of the same name's family,
// not the rewrite -- so setter-ness has to flow through a call's return value, which neither
// upstream's validator nor this rule tracks.
//
// Porting that pass is the fix and it is a real one, not a line. It is left undone deliberately
// rather than approximated here, because a hand-rolled "follow the return value" would diverge from
// upstream in the other direction on every non-memo call. Recorded as a failing-shape fixture so
// the divergence is a fact in the suite rather than a surprise, and so the day the inlining pass
// lands this test is what tells its author the gap closed.
//
// The propagation is also not general, which bounds what the erasure claims. A closure passed
// through an ordinary function or a custom hook stays silent in both implementations, measured on
// both: only `useMemo` and `useCallback` are erased, because only those two are what
// `dropManualMemoization` recognises.
