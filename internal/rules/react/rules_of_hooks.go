// # Which implementation this reproduces, and why the answer is not obvious here
//
// Two live implementations exist and they are **not** the same algorithm, which is unusual for this
// catalog. oxc's `rules_of_hooks.rs` is not a transliteration of ESLint's rule; it is an independent
// reimplementation reaching the same verdicts by different machinery, and on three shapes it reaches
// **different** verdicts. This port reproduces oxc, because oxc is what the differential gate runs,
// and every divergence is named below with the command that established it.
//
// Both were read in full. ESLint's is the original and lives in this tree as a compiled but
// unminified bundle at `node_modules/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/cjs/eslint-plugin-react-hooks.development.js`
// (version 7.1.1, the rule at lines 54935-55400), and the original TypeScript was fetched from
// `facebook/react`, `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/rules/RulesOfHooks.ts`. Both are
// executable here, so every claim in this comment is a measurement rather than a reading: ESLint's
// Linter API runs from `~/Projects/ahra`, and the release oxlint binary is at
// `~/Projects/system/oxc/target/release/oxlint`.
//
// # The three measured divergences between oxc HEAD and ESLint 7.1.1
//
// The dispatch that commissioned this port expected oxc to be pinned at 2024 and therefore behind.
// It is not: `git log` on `rules_of_hooks.rs` shows its last change on 2026-08-14, ten days before
// this was written, and the commit is titled "report hooks inside try blocks". So oxc is the newer
// behaviour on the axis that matters most, and the drift runs the opposite way from what was
// expected.
//
//	try { const v = 1; useHook(v); } catch {}
//	    oxc     reports "called conditionally"
//	    eslint  clean
//
// oxc treats **any** Hook inside a `try` block as conditional, syntactically, without asking whether
// the `try` can throw. The case above cannot throw at all and still reports. ESLint asks its code
// path whether the segment is on every path, and a non-throwing `try` is, so it stays clean. This is
// oxc's newer rule and it is reproduced here: `isInsideTryStatement` below is a syntactic ancestor
// walk, deliberately, and the control-flow graph is not consulted for it.
//
//	function Component() { if (a) { return 1; } else { return 2; } useHook(); }
//	    oxc     silent
//	    eslint  reports "called conditionally"
//
// The opposite direction. oxc declines a Hook in code nothing reaches; ESLint's segment is
// unreachable but its `reactHooksMap` still holds it, and the path arithmetic reports. Reproduced as
// oxc: an unreachable Hook is not a Hook that runs, so this rule stays quiet and `no-unreachable`
// owns the finding. The same applies after a bare `throw`.
//
//	function notAComponent() { useÉtat(); }
//	    oxc     reports
//	    eslint  clean
//
// oxc's `is_react_hook_name` tests the fourth character with `char::is_uppercase`, which is Unicode.
// ESLint's is `/^use[A-Z0-9]/`, which is not. Reproduced as oxc, which means this rule's hook
// predicate is Unicode-uppercase-or-ASCII-digit, and that is why it cannot use
// `internal/utilities/react.IsHookName` — see below.
//
// One more difference is cosmetic rather than behavioural and is recorded so nobody re-derives it:
// for `Namespace.useThing()` oxc renders the hook name as `useThing` and ESLint renders it as
// `Namespace.useThing`. Our messages carry no interpolated name at all, so nothing here depends on
// it.
//
// # The shelf helper that is wrong for this rule, measured in three directions
//
// `internal/utilities/react.IsHookName` is exactly the shape this reaches for and would be wrong on
// every case in this rule's corpus that discriminates. Its body requires a name longer than `use`
// and tests `unicode.IsUpper` alone. Against both oracles, run on `Hook.use()`, `Hook.use42()` and
// `Hook.useHook()` from upstream's own case 133:
//
//	use          shelf says no; oxc and eslint both report it as a Hook
//	use2FAMutation, use42, use3DEngine
//	             shelf says no; oxc and eslint both report them as Hooks
//	useÉtat      shelf says yes; eslint says no, oxc says yes
//
// So the shelf disagrees with **both** implementations on the first two rows, and the corpus
// exercises them directly: `use2FAMutation` and `use3DEngine` are upstream pass cases whose whole
// point is that they are recognized as Hooks. `isHookIdentifierName` below is this rule's own
// predicate for that reason, and the divergence is not a defect in the shelf function so much as
// three sources with three answers, of which the shelf matches our own TypeScript house layer.
// Adjusting the shelf would break its thirteen other callers, so this rule owns its own.
//
// # Reached differently than ESLint, because we have a program and it does not
//
// ESLint's rule is built on `eslint-scope`. It records every `useEffectEvent` binding by walking
// scope references, and it resolves function names by inspecting the enclosing declarator through
// scope analysis. We have a resident type checker and a whole-program graph and could answer both by
// resolution. This port answers neither by resolution, and that is a fidelity decision rather than a
// capability one: oxc's `get_declaration_identifier` reads the **syntactic** parent — a variable
// declarator, an assignment target, an assignment pattern, an object property key — and never
// resolves anything. Resolving would report on shapes upstream is silent for. The rule therefore
// declares no type checker, and the checker is not consulted anywhere.
//
// # The control-flow graph, and the one place it does not answer the question
//
// This is the first rule in the catalog to consume `internal/utilities/controlflow`, which is a
// basic-block graph vendored from rslint whose block layout deliberately mirrors ESLint's own code
// path analysis. Whether that mirroring actually holds for the shapes this rule turns on had never
// been tested, so it was probed against both oracles before anything was built on it. Sixteen
// shapes, one Hook each, comparing `PathAnalysis.IsOnEveryFinalPath` and `IsCyclic` against what the
// two binaries print:
//
//	straight line, if-test, ternary-test, `&&`-left        onEveryFinal=true    both silent
//	if-body, `&&`-right, ternary-branch, switch-case       onEveryFinal=false   both conditional
//	statement after an early return                        onEveryFinal=false   both conditional
//	while body, for body, while-in-try                     cyclic=true          both loop
//
// Twelve of sixteen match exactly, which is a real result: `IsOnEveryFinalPath` is precisely
// ESLint's `countPathsFromStart * countPathsToEnd !== allPathsFromStartToEnd` comparison computed as
// dominance instead of as path arithmetic, and it agrees on every shape where the two can be
// compared. The four that do not are the three try-shapes above, which are a genuine oxc-versus-
// ESLint disagreement rather than a graph defect, and one graph shape that needs stating:
//
//	do { useHook(); } while (cond);
//	    our graph  cyclic=FALSE, onEveryFinal=TRUE
//	    oxc        reports "may be executed more than once"
//	    eslint     reports the same
//
// A `do…while` body genuinely runs on the way to the test, and the back edge re-enters the **test**
// rather than the body header, so no cycle passes through the body block on the first iteration and
// the dominance answer is correct about the graph while being useless for the rule. **ESLint hits
// this too and solves it exactly the way this rule does**, with a syntactic `isInsideDoWhileLoop`
// check sitting beside the code-path answer rather than derived from it (bundle line 54943). That is
// not a workaround for a defect in our graph; it is the same shape upstream, independently. The
// dispatch for this port predicted the `do…while` divergence would arrive through `labelsOf` keeping
// outer labels on a `continue`; the divergence is real and its cause is this instead.
//
// # What the corpus said that reading the sources did not
//
// Two things. `function useUnreachable() { return; useHook(); }` is an upstream **pass** case, which
// is the only statement anywhere that a Hook nothing reaches is not this rule's problem; both
// sources' code reads as though it would report. And case 133 enumerates the hook-name predicate
// exhaustively against a namespace: of `Hook.use()`, `Hook._use()`, `Hook.useState()`,
// `Hook._useState()`, `Hook.use42()`, `Hook.useHook()`, `Hook.use_hook()`, exactly four report. No
// prose in either implementation says that; the corpus does.
//
// # Scope
//
// The `useEffectEvent` **reference-escape** family is deliberately not ported. Upstream tracks every
// reference to a binding initialized by `useEffectEvent(...)` and reports each one that is not
// lexically inside an effect call, which needs a symbol-reference index this rule would otherwise
// have no use for. It is 12 of the 124 upstream diagnostics and a distinct feature rather than a
// missing branch of this one. The **inline**-escape arm is ported, because it needs only the call's
// own parent. Stated rather than silently missing: a `useEffectEvent` result assigned to a variable
// and then passed to a child is a finding this port gives up.
