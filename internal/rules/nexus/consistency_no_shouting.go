// Why a lint rule and not a style note: comments are the register the next reader inherits. A mind
// that opens a file already shouting comes up braced and writes its own comments a little louder to
// match, so the volume ratchets file by file until emphasis means nothing because everything has it.
//
// There is a craft argument underneath the tone one. "NEVER cache this" is a writer hoping volume
// will carry a claim the sentence does not. "Caching this returns a stale session id after a fork"
// needs no capitals, because it gives the reason. Turning the volume down tends to force the reason
// out, which is the actual repair.
//
// Backticks are the escape hatch, and they are the whole discipline: the rule is not "no capitals",
// it is "tell me which kind of capitals this is." Code wears backticks and is never read as
// shouting. Everything outside them is you talking.
//
// No fix, deliberately. Lowercasing the word leaves the sentence that needed shouting still weak,
// and the repair is usually to state the reason instead, which a rule cannot write.
