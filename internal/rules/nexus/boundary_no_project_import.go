// BoundaryNoProjectImportOptions configures which library is guarded and what it may still read.
//
// Both fields are options rather than constants because base and structure each guard their own
// directory with their own whitelist, and this rule is meant to know about neither.

	// LibraryDirectory is the path fragment identifying the guarded library, matched against the
	// normalized filename. "/libraries/base/", say. Files outside it are never visited.

//	valid:   import { thing } from '@structure/source/Thing'   (inside /libraries/base/)
//	valid:   import { settings } from '@project/ProjectSettings' when named in Allowed
//	invalid: import { helper } from '@project/source/Helper'
//	invalid: const x = require('@project/source/Helper')
//
// A few project files exist precisely for the framework to read. ProjectSettings is the usual one:
// the project answers questions the framework's own interface asks. Those are named in Allowed
// rather than reached through a runtime path read, which would dodge this rule while giving up
// types, refactoring, and go-to-definition.
//
// The whitelist match is exact, not a prefix. A prefix would let '@project/ProjectSettings' admit
// '@project/ProjectSettingsSecret', so a whitelist entry would quietly widen over time as files
// were added beside the one that was actually approved.
//
// This rule declines every file outside the guarded directory before any node is visited, and a
// configuration with an empty LibraryDirectory declines everything. That last case matters: it is
// how a rule registered without its required option fails closed rather than guarding the whole
// tree by accident.
