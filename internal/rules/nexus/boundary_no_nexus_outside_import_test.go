// TestBoundaryNoNexusOutsideImportReportsTheSpecifier pins where the finding lands.
//
// This rule reported the whole declaration until a census compared it against its two sibling
// boundary rules, which both wrap the node in `imports.SpecifierNode`. Every fixture above stayed
// green through the change, because `ExpectFindings` asserts message ids and count and nothing
// else: a rule whose defect is where it points passes a complete fixture pair while being wrong.
//
// The difference is narrower than it first looks, and the measurement is worth keeping. On a
// single-line import the two spellings agree, because `ctx.ReportNode` routes through `TokenRange`
// and strips leading trivia, so a comment above the statement does not move the finding. Measured
// on eight shapes; seven agreed.
//
// The eighth is a multiline import, which is common in real code. There the declaration starts on
// the line of the `import` keyword while the specifier sits several lines down, so the finding
// landed on line 1 and an `eslint-disable-next-line` written above the specifier could not reach
// it. A `-next-line` directive matches the line after itself, so the finding was unreachable by any
// suppression the author could write, and it read as a real finding in every count.
