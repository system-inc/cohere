// The TypeScript originals learned this the same way, which is why several of them share one
// visitor factory rather than each writing the static case and forgetting the other two.

// SourceVisitors builds the listeners that call report for every string specifier in a file,
// whichever of the three shapes it arrives in.
//
// **Not every rule that reads an import wants this, and reaching for it by default would widen rules
// that are correctly narrow.** Four `structure` rules watch `KindImportDeclaration` alone and are
// right to: `react-import-no-destructuring` asks about the binding form of a static import, and a
// dynamic `import('react')` has no destructuring to flag. A rule guarding a *boundary* needs all
// three shapes because the missed one routes around it; a rule asking about how a static import is
// *written* needs exactly one.
//
// The test is whether the rule is about where a module comes from or about the syntax that brings it
// in. Only the first wants this.
//
// report is handed the specifier and the node to blame. The node differs by shape on purpose: a
// static import blames the whole declaration, while a dynamic or require call blames the call, since
// that is the expression a reader has to change.
