// ForFunction is Lower followed by Construct, computed once per function per file and shared by
// every rule that asks.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// Three react rules lower the same functions independently, each over the whole source file:
// set-state-in-render, static-components, and set-state-in-effect. A component holding a `useMemo`,
// a state setter, and a JSX tag was lowered three times and converted to single-assignment form
// three times. Measured with `cohere --timing` before this existed: set-state-in-effect 829ms,
// set-state-in-render 535ms, static-components 494ms, against every syntactic react rule under
// 20ms. The author of the most expensive one named the cause exactly — "a property of lowering, not
// this rule" — and a shared per-file cache as the fix.
//
// # Why Construct is inside the cached value rather than left to the caller
//
// This is the part that makes a shared lowering safe, and getting it wrong would have been silent.
// `Construct` mutates in place: it renames identifiers and appends phis. It is NOT idempotent.
// Measured on `let y = 2; if (y > 1) { y = 1; } else { y = 2; } let x = y; return x;`, a second
// Construct over the same graph moved it from 1 phi and 5 named values to 2 phis and 6 named
// values.
//
// The dangerous part is that the doubly-constructed graph is still WELL-FORMED — `VerifySSA`
// reports zero violations on it. So a cache that handed out a raw lowering and let each of the
// three callers run its own Construct would have given the second and third caller a graph carrying
// phis that correspond to no branch in the source, with no verifier, no panic, and no test
// complaining. It would have surfaced later as a wrong finding in whichever rule happened to run
// second, and it would have looked like a bug in that rule rather than in this cache.
//
// So the unit stored here is the finished graph, lowered and constructed, and Construct runs
// exactly once per function. That also answers whether construction wants a cache of its own: it
// does not, because it is not separable from the lowering it mutates. Measured on the probe
// component in cache_test.go, construction is about 18% of the combined cost (23µs against 102µs
// for lowering), and all of it is now paid once rather than three times. Callers read it and must not mutate it; the three callers today only
// read, deriving their own maps (`UnconditionalBlocks` builds a fresh map, the taint passes build
// their own).
//
// # Why the function node alone is the key
//
// `Lower` takes a node and a type checker, so a key naming only the node is wrong if the checker
// can differ between two calls within one file. It cannot. `internal/program/walk.go` builds one
// `fileChecker` per file and closes it into every rule's Context alongside the one `FileCache`
// created on the line above, so the checker and this cache have exactly the same lifetime. A
// differing checker would mean a differing cache, and there is no path that produces one.
//
// # Why this is safe for the on-disk findings cache
//
// It is not run-scoped state and it reaches nothing outside the file. A lowering is derived purely
// from a function node in the file being linted plus that file's checker, and the cache is created
// and discarded per file by the walk. So no rule using this acquires the `ReadsProgram` property,
// and the hash-keyed findings cache stays correct: nothing here can make one file's result depend
// on another file's contents, which is the failure `ReadsProgram` exists to declare.

	if node == nil {
		return nil

	// Declining a checker-less file here rather than in each caller keeps the answer independent of

	// resolves every reference as a global, making the result well-formed and meaningless, and two
	// of the three callers already refused to run in that state. Deciding it once means a cached
	// entry cannot depend on rule order.

// ForFunctionWithoutManualMemoization is ForFunction with `useMemo` and `useCallback` erased and
// the resulting immediately-invoked calls inlined, which is the graph upstream's validators read.
//
// # Why this is a second cache entry rather than a step inside the first
//
// Upstream erases manual memoization at `Pipeline.ts:169`, before any validator runs, so a rule
// ported from one of those validators is only faithful if its input has been through the same
// erasure. `set-state-in-effect` is one: `const f = useCallback(() => setS(1), []); useEffect(() =>
// f())` is reported by React 7.1.1 and was silent here, because the wrapper broke the alias chain
// the rule follows. The rewrite `useCallback(fn, deps)` -> `LoadLocal fn` restores it with no
// change to the rule.
//
// Putting the pass in `ForFunction` was tried first and is wrong, which the suite caught rather
// than review: three other rules read that same cached graph and need the memo call intact.
// `set-state-in-render` distinguishes a setter called inside a `useMemo` callback from one called
// during render, and with the call erased the first shape becomes the second, so two fixtures
// reported twice. `refs` misnamed a finding on `error.maybe-mutable-ref-not-preserved`, and
// `immutability` failed too. The pass mutates in place, so sharing it silently changes what every
// later rule sees — the same hazard the Construct note above describes, in a form no verifier
// catches.
//
// So the erasure is one rule family's view of the graph, not the representation's, and it gets its
// own entry under its own key.
//
// # What the second lowering costs, measured twice because the first measurement was wrong
//
// Ungated, it costs about 100ms of a 2.1s lint phase. Gated by `mentionsManualMemoization` below it
// costs nothing measurable: over Kirk's tree, twenty-five interleaved runs of each binary, median
// 2.160s with the erasure against 2.170s without it, and the minimum is 1.950s against 1.960s. Two
// statistics that disagree in opposite directions by ten milliseconds is what "no difference" looks
// like. The gate is why: 12,986 of 13,171 functions skip the second lowering entirely, so only the
// 185 that actually memoize pay for one.
//
// The inlining pass added alongside the erasure is free for the same reason: it only runs on the
// functions the gate already admitted. Ten interleaved runs each, before and after wiring it in:
// mean 2.038s against 2.059s, minimum 1.970s against 1.980s.
//
// An earlier version of this comment claimed 570ms, and that number was measured wrong in a way
// worth recording because the trap is easy to fall into twice. It came from runs under `--timing`,
// which wraps every listener call in a `time.Now` pair; `cmd/cohere/timing.go` says so on the line
// that prints the total, in as many words -- compare rules to each other, never these totals to a
// normal run. It also came from three samples against a machine whose run-to-run spread is larger
// than the effect being measured. The honest procedure is what produced the numbers above:
// interleave the binaries so drift hits both, take twenty-plus samples, and read the median and the
// minimum rather than the mean, since a single descheduled run moves a mean and cannot move a
// minimum.
//
// A future `ForFunction` could keep the memo call and record the rewrite alongside it, letting both
// families read one graph and removing even the gated cost. That is a change to the representation
// and wants its own commit, its own measurement, and the six rules re-run against it. It is not
// worth doing for the time: it is worth doing only if a third rule family ever wants the erased
// form, at which point the gate stops being enough.
//
// Running the pass after Construct rather than before it, as upstream's line order has it, is safe
// for the reason the pass's own header gives: it creates and deletes no instruction, block, or
// terminal, so the control-flow graph is bit-identical and single-assignment form is undisturbed.
// Only one instruction value per memo call changes, toward fewer operands.
// `AnalyzePreservedManualMemoization` already sequences it post-Construct for the same reason.

// (`import {useCallback as memo}` called as `memo(...)`), and that is already outside what the pass
