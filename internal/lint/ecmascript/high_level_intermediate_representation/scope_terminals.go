// Reactive scope terminals: turning the scope side table into control-flow structure.
//
// This is React's `buildReactiveScopeTerminalsHIR` (development bundle line 26224), run over this
// graph. oxc transcribes it at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_inference/build_reactive_scope_terminals_hir.rs`; where the
// two disagree React wins, and each disagreement is recorded at the line that resolves it.
//
// # What this pass does, and why it is a rewrite rather than an annotation
//
// Every pass before this one records scopes in a SIDE TABLE: `scopes.go` assigns them,
// `align_scopes.go` widens them to block boundaries, `merge_scopes.go` unions the overlapping ones.
// After all three, a scope is still only a pair of evaluation-order positions with a member list.
// Nothing in the control-flow graph knows a scope exists.
//
// The consumer that needs them does not read the table. `propagate_scope_dependencies_hir` recovers
// scopes by WALKING BLOCKS FOR A SCOPE TERMINAL -- React's `keyByScopeId` is six lines of
// `if (block.terminal.kind === 'scope')`, and oxc's entrypoint matches `Terminal::Scope { .. }`
// identically. Measured before this file was written, over 400 corpus files and 677 functions:
//
//	scopes in the side table                     3,286
//	scopes after align-then-merge                2,874
//	scopes reachable from a CFG terminal             0
//
// That zero is the denominator, not a gap to widen later. A dependency pass ported onto a graph with
// no scope terminals would run, terminate, pass its fixtures, and produce zero dependencies BY
// CONSTRUCTION, because its visitors are gated on a non-empty scope stack that nothing ever pushes.
// This pass is what moves that zero.
//
// # The rewrite, which splits blocks
//
// For each scope, two positions matter: `range.start`, where the scope begins, and `range.end`,
// where it ends. At each, the block containing that position is SPLIT, and a terminal is inserted:
//
//	at range.start   a Scope terminal, whose Block is the scope body and whose Fallthrough is
//	                 where control resumes after the scope completes
//	at range.end     a Goto with variant Break, jumping to that same fallthrough
//
// So one block becomes up to three, and the instructions are distributed between them by position.
// A block containing several scope boundaries splits several times; the rewrites are applied in one
// left-to-right sweep per block, each carving off the instructions before it.
//
// # Nesting is a PRECONDITION, and it is enforced upstream by an assertion
//
// `recursivelyTraverseItems` -- which this pass uses to visit scopes in nesting order -- carries a
// hard `CompilerError.invariant(disjoint || nested)`. It is not a filter; upstream stops. React
// calls `assertValidBlockNesting(hir)` on the line IMMEDIATELY BEFORE this pass (bundle 50213/50214)
// and oxc does the same (`pipeline.rs:293/295`), independently, which is upstream telling you the
// precondition rather than leaving it to be discovered.
//
// Three stages exist because of that assertion. Measured on this corpus, scope-versus-scope
// non-nesting was 40 before `merge_scopes.go` and 0 after; the FULL assertion, which also compares
// every block's fallthrough subtree, was 249 before `align_scopes.go` and 8 after on the current
// live corpus. All eight are scope-involving residues in plain helper functions; components and
// hooks are at zero. The former block-against-block residue disappeared when reverse postorder began
// matching React's traversal. `ScopeTerminalsPrecondition` reports whether a function satisfies the
// scope-nesting portion, so a caller declines rather than producing a corrupt graph.
//
// # Termination: two sweeps over finite slices, no fixpoint
//
// There is no worklist and no iteration to convergence. `recursivelyTraverseItems` sorts the scopes
// once and walks them once, maintaining a stack that only shrinks when an item is disjoint, so each
// scope is entered exactly once and exited exactly once -- 2n rewrites for n scopes. The block sweep
// then visits each block once and, within it, each instruction position once, consuming rewrites
// from a queue that only shrinks. Work is linear in blocks plus instructions plus scopes, and every
// loop is over a slice whose length is fixed before it begins.
//
// This is deliberately a weaker claim than a fixpoint argument, because there is no fixpoint here to
// argue about. `TestScopeTerminalsAreASinglePass` pins it empirically by counting visits.
//
// # What must re-run afterwards, and why getting it wrong is silent
//
// Splitting blocks invalidates three things the graph maintains: block order, predecessor edges, and
// evaluation order. React re-runs `reversePostorderBlocks`, `markPredecessors`, and
// `markInstructionIds`; `Finalize` here is exactly that trio in that order, and this pass calls it.
//
// Phi operands are the fourth, and they are the one a reader does not expect. A phi names its
// operands BY PREDECESSOR BLOCK ID. When a block is split, the predecessor that reaches a successor
// is no longer the original block but the LAST block carved out of it, so every phi operand keyed by
// the original id has to be rekeyed to the final one. React does this explicitly after swapping the
// block table, and omitting it produces a phi reading from a block that no longer flows there --
// wrong values, no crash, and nothing in a well-formedness check that would notice.
//
// `Construct` is NOT re-run. It is not idempotent: running it twice on the same function moved 1 phi
// to 2 while `VerifySSA` reported zero violations. This pass therefore runs AFTER single-assignment
// construction and repairs the phis in place rather than rebuilding them, which is also what
// upstream does.

// ScopeIdentity is how this pass resolves a value's scope to the scope that actually survives.
//
// # Why this exists, and the defect it was written to fix
//
// A value's scope id comes from `ReactiveScopes.ScopeOf`, which is the PRE-MERGE table.
// `merge_scopes.go` then unions overlapping scopes, so several pre-merge ids can name one surviving
// scope, and `align_scopes.go` widens the ranges under both. A pass that keys on the pre-merge id
// while reading the merged RANGE gets a coherent-looking wrong answer: every scope has a plausible
// range, so nothing is empty, nothing is inverted, and the nesting precondition still passes.
//
// Measured on this corpus, that mistake builds 3,286 terminals for 2,874 scopes -- 412 duplicates,
// each a second terminal wrapping a range another terminal already owns. `propagate_scope_dependencies`
// keys its output by scope id, so the duplicates would collide and the surviving entry would depend
// on map order. The tell was that the built count EXCEEDED the control, which is why the control is
// measured alongside the headline rather than after it.

// against a hand-built table and lets a caller that has not merged pass `UnmergedScopes`.
