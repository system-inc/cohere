// ReversePostorder reorders Function.Blocks into reverse postorder and drops unreachable blocks.
//
// # Why unreachable blocks are dropped here and kept in controlflow
//
// `controlflow` keeps them, because a rule may want to ask what would have run after a `return`.
// This drops them, because a value defined only in a block control never reaches is a value no
// analysis should see: single-assignment construction over an unreachable definition produces a phi
// operand from a predecessor that cannot execute, and every effect derived from it is fiction.
//
// A pass wanting the unreachable code should read the AST, or the other graph. This one is for
// reasoning about what runs.
//
// The traversal is upstream's `getReversePostorderedBlocks`: visit a structural fallthrough first,
// then the real successors in reverse order. Postorder is reversed at the end, so that puts loop
// bodies and conditional arms before their continuation in the final slice. That ordering is more
// than presentation. Evaluation order is assigned from this slice, and mutable-range inference
// must see a mutation in a loop body before a read after the loop.
//
// A fallthrough is visited initially as structural rather than executable. If no real edge reaches
// it, upstream retains its block id as an empty Unreachable block; if a real edge reaches it later,
// the same block is revisited as executable. Keeping those two states separate prevents a
// fallthrough link from manufacturing a control-flow edge while still preserving the structured
// terminal's required target.
