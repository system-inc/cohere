// Hoistable property loads: which accesses may be read before their scope runs.
//
// This is React's `collectHoistablePropertyLoads` and `propagateNonNull` (development bundle lines
// 46578 and 46770), run over this graph. oxc transcribes both inside
// `react_compiler_inference/propagate_scope_dependencies_hir.rs`; where the two disagree React wins,
// and each disagreement is recorded at the line that resolves it.
//
// # What this buys, in one number
//
// `dependencies.go` shipped with every dependency truncated to its bare root: 4,426 of 4,426 with an
// empty path, so a scope reported depending on all of `props` rather than on `props.a.b`. That was
// not an approximation -- it is exactly what `addDependency` does when handed an empty hoistable
// set, upstream's `else { break; }` arm -- and the missing input is what this file computes.
//
// The reason a path may not simply be kept is the one the whole analysis exists for: reading
// `props.a.b` before the scope runs is safe only if `props.a` is known non-null at that point.
// Hoisting an access past a place where the value might be null MOVES A CRASH, or invents one that
// the original program never had. So each step of a path has to be proven reachable-without-throwing
// before the dependency may name it.
//
// # The safe direction, and the one to guard
//
// Under-approximating the hoistable set costs precision only: a path truncates early, the scope
// depends on something shallower, and it recomputes more often than it needed to. Over-approximating
// is the dangerous direction, because it produces a dependency on `props.a.b` for a program where
// `props.a` can be nullish, and the memoized read then throws where the original did not.
//
// Every gap in this file is therefore checked to fall on the under-approximating side, and
// `TestHoistablePathsAreAlwaysPrefixesOfRealAccesses` pins the invariant that a derived path
// is always a prefix of a real access rather than an invention.
//
// # Termination: TWO stories, and neither is a fixpoint proof
//
// This is the first pass in this package whose termination is a BOUND rather than an argument, and
// it is worth being exact about, because a bound that is silently exceeded produces a truncated
// answer that looks like a converged one.
//
//	the outer loop      alternating forward and backward passes, capped at 100 iterations
//	the chain reduction an unbounded do/while inside `reduceMaybeOptionalChains`
//
// The outer loop is monotone in practice -- each pass can only union new nodes into a block's set --
// but `reduceMaybeOptionalChains` REPLACES nodes rather than adding them, so the `changed` flag is
// computed by set comparison rather than by size, and the monotonicity argument does not close. That
// is why upstream caps it, and it is why the cap is reproduced here rather than removed.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM oxc: the bound must be LOUD, not silent
//
// React raises a hard `CompilerError.invariant(i++ < 100)` naming the pass when the loop fails to
// converge (bundle 46820). oxc writes `for _ in 0..100` and simply EXITS at the cap, so a function
// that needed a 101st pass silently gets a truncated answer that is indistinguishable from a
// converged one.
//
// React is the truth and this reproduces its behaviour, not oxc's: `HoistableAnalysis.Converged`
// reports whether the loop finished because nothing changed, and a caller reading a non-converged
// result knows the answer is partial. A linter must not panic, so this reports rather than raises --
// the same trade `ValidateScopes` made -- but the fact is never hidden.
//
// Measured over 400 corpus files and 677 functions, the convergence distribution is:
//
//	iterations    1     2     3    4+   not converged
//	functions   633    41     3     0               0
//
// The maximum observed is 3 against a cap of 100, so the bound is nowhere near being approached on
// real code. That is a materially different fact from a bound that is routinely brushed, and
// `TestHoistableConvergenceIsFarInsideTheBound` pins it so a future change that starts approaching
// the cap is a visible event rather than a slow drift into silent truncation.
//
// The inner `reduceMaybeOptionalChains` loop is unbounded upstream and is unbounded here. It
// terminates because every replacement strictly reduces the number of optional entries in a path and
// a path has finitely many entries, so no node can be replaced more times than its path is long.
// That argument is upstream's own by construction rather than stated by it, and
// `TestOptionalChainReductionTerminates` pins it on the shape that would loop if it were wrong.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: `terminalPreds` is dead code and is not reproduced
//
// React's `propagateNonNull` builds a `terminalPreds` set of every block ending in `throw` or
// `return` (bundle 46777) and never reads it again. oxc does not build it. Verified by reading every
// use of the binding in the bundle: there is exactly one, its construction. Not reproduced here,
// because copying an unread variable is transcription rather than fidelity -- the same judgement
// `RangeGapLoopCarriedInversion` made about an upstream bug.

// past `x` and infers `propB.x.y` where upstream infers bare `propB`. The developer's own answer
// becomes the evidence for a deeper answer, and the rule reports a disagreement it manufactured.
// Preservation-enabled mode separately seeds immutable non-optional prefixes from StartMemoize,
// matching React's explicit option gate. Raw loads must still be excluded: they ignore both that
// option and the optional-path stopping rule. MANUAL_MEMO_HOISTING.md records the distinction.
//
// # Why upstream never sees these instructions
//
// Its pipeline drops manual memoization at `Pipeline.ts:168`, runs dead-code elimination at line
// 230, and runs the dependency analysis at line 428. `DeadCodeElimination.ts:371` keeps
// `StartMemoize` and `FinishMemoize` -- "we can't DCE without losing the memoization guarantees" --
// while `PropertyLoad`, `ArrayExpression` and `LoadGlobal` fall through to the prunable list. So
// what the developer declared survives in the marker, and the instructions that built the array do
// not. This tree keeps them: `drop_manual_memoization.go` leaves them deliberately, matching
// upstream's pass, and the elimination upstream relies on afterwards is not written here.
//
// Excluding them at the seed rather than deleting them keeps that difference contained. No
// instruction is removed, so numbering, terminals and every block-keyed analysis are untouched.
//
// # Reached from the array, not matched by path
//
// The elements are walked back through the values feeding them, and only a load whose result
// nothing else reads is taken. Matching by declared path instead was measured and is wrong:
// `useMemo-conditional-access-noAlloc.ts` both reads `propB?.x.y` in the callback body and declares
// it, and upstream's compiled guard is `$[1] !== t1` where `t1 = propB?.x.y` -- so the body's own
