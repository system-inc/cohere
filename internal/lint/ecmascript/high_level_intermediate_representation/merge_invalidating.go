// Merging adjacent scopes that invalidate together: the tree-level merge.
//
// This is React's `mergeReactiveScopesThatInvalidateTogether`
// (`ReactiveScopes/MergeReactiveScopesThatInvalidateTogether.ts` at `react_conformance.UpstreamSha`).
//
// # Not the merge this package already has, and the distinction is load-bearing
//
// `merge_scopes.go` is `mergeOverlappingReactiveScopesHIR`, upstream pipeline position 394. It runs
// on the GRAPH and exists as a precondition: it unions scopes whose ranges overlap without nesting,
// so that every scope can become a block. Without it `assertValidBlockNesting` fails outright.
//
// This is pipeline position 482, runs on the TREE, and is an optimisation rather than a
// precondition. It fuses ADJACENT scopes whose invalidation conditions are identical and removes
// nested scopes that repeat their enclosing scope's dependency set. Both affect memo validation.
//
// Confusing the two is easy and the names encourage it. The first asks "do these ranges overlap",
// the second asks "would these two always recompute together".
//
// # Why the rule needs it, which is the reason this is ported at all
//
// `scope.merged` -- the set of scope ids a surviving scope absorbed -- is written in exactly one
// place in the whole compiler, this pass, and read by `validatePreservedManualMemoization` to fold
// absorbed ids into the scope set it tracks. Producer and consumer with no codegen between them.
//
// That is the opposite of `promoteUsedTemporaries`, which was declined: the only consumer of what
// that pass wrote was the renamer.

// corpus coverage here: only 2 of 1,576 corpus scopes carry a reassignment, so this arm is real but
// rare and needs its own fixture rather than the corpus to exercise it.
//
// # Two: identical dependencies
//
// Two scopes reading exactly the same inputs recompute under exactly the same conditions, so one
// scope does the work of both.
//
// # Three: the earlier scope's outputs are the later scope's inputs
//
// The arm with the judgment in it, and upstream's comment explains why it is not simply "the values
// flow from one to the other". A scope's output is not guaranteed to change when its input changes:
// `foo(x)` returning `x < 10` is unchanged as `x` goes from 0 to 1. Fusing on flow alone would make
// the later scope recompute whenever the earlier one's inputs moved, even when its own actual input
// did not.
//
// So the flow must additionally be through values whose type guarantees a fresh identity every

//
// # The walk, which is a candidate span rather than a pairwise comparison
//
// Each block is scanned once holding at most one candidate: a scope, the index it started at, the
// index one past the last scope folded into it, and the declarations named since. Three things end
// a candidate -- a terminal, a pruned scope, and an instruction outside the allowlist -- because

//
// A candidate commits only when it spans more than one scope. I expected omitting that guard to
// produce self-references in `Merged` and said so before measuring; it does not. `rewrite` folds
// only the statements strictly after a candidate's own scope, which is an empty range for a span of
// one, so a single-scope run reaches the rewrite and contributes nothing.
