// Dropping dependencies that cannot change, so a scope stops comparing values that never differ.
//
// This is React's `pruneNonReactiveDependencies`
// (`ReactiveScopes/PruneNonReactiveDependencies.ts` at `react_conformance.UpstreamSha`).
//
// `CollectScopeDependencies` infers a scope's inputs without asking whether they can change over
// time, because at that point the answer is not known. This pass removes the ones that cannot, so a
// scope compares only values that might actually differ between renders.
//
// # This is the one 6b5 pass that changes an answer the rule computes
//
// `validatePreservedManualMemoization` compares dependency sets directly. `pruneUnusedScopes` and
// `pruneAlwaysInvalidatingScopes` add state alongside what the rule reads -- the pruned set -- but
// this one deletes from `scope.dependencies` itself. Skipping it leaves every scope's dependency set
// wider than upstream's, and the rule would compare sets that do not correspond.
//
// # Where our reactivity comes from, which is not where upstream's does
//
// Upstream builds a `Set<IdentifierId>` by walking the tree and seeding from hook results, props and
// a handful of propagating instruction shapes. This tree already has `InferReactive`, which writes
// `Place.Reactive` -- 31,949 of 51,945 corpus places carry it -- so the seed is read rather than
// recomputed.
//
// What is not already done is the propagation this pass performs on top: a scope with any reactive
// dependency makes all of its own outputs reactive, because those outputs re-evaluate whenever the
// dependency changes. That is a fact about scopes rather than about values, so `InferReactive` could
// not have known it, and it runs here.
