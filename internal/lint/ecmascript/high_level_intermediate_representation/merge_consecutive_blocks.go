// Merging blocks that always execute one after the other.
//
// This is React's `mergeConsecutiveBlocks` (`HIR/MergeConsecutiveBlocks.ts`), which upstream calls
// on the line after `inlineImmediatelyInvokedFunctionExpressions` (`Pipeline.ts:180`). The two are
// a pair rather than two independent passes, and the ordering is not decoration.
//
// # Why the inliner needs it, measured rather than assumed
//
// The splice cuts one block into three: the code before the call, the copied body, and the
// continuation. On the single-return path all three are joined by plain `Goto`s, so the region is
// straight-line code that has been given block boundaries it did not have before.
//
// Those boundaries are not inert here. `DropManualMemoization` rewrites `useMemo(fn, deps)` into a
// zero-argument call of `fn`, which is structurally an IIFE, so the inliner splices it -- correctly,
// and upstream does the same. But it leaves `StartMemoize` in the first block and `FinishMemoize`
// in the third, and scope construction reads block structure. Measured on the vendored corpus with
// the splice and no merge: the goldens this rule fires on fell from 15 to 6, and every one of the
// nine losses was a fixture where a splice had happened. With the merge the region is one block
// again and the markers sit where they sat before.

// MergeConsecutiveBlocks collapses each block into its predecessor where control always flows from
// one to the other, and reports how many blocks were merged away.
//
// The condition is upstream's, and all four parts are load-bearing:
//
//   - The block has exactly one predecessor, so nothing else can reach it.
//   - The predecessor ends in a plain `Goto`, so it always transfers control here.
//
// # The first two overlap on every graph reached so far, and the count is kept anyway
//
// A mutation sweep could not kill the predecessor-count condition. Three fixtures were built to try
// -- a plain branch, a splice in one arm, a splice in both -- and all three produced byte-identical
// graphs with the condition removed. The reason is the walk order rather than the condition being
// wrong: blocks are visited in reverse postorder, so by the time a join is reached its predecessors
// have already absorbed their own predecessors and carry the join's terminal, and the `Goto`
// condition rejects it before the count is consulted.
//
// That is an accident of how lowering shapes a graph, not a property this pass should rely on. A
// join whose resolved predecessor still ends in a `Goto` would be swallowed without the count, and
// swallowing a join makes its other predecessors skip its instructions entirely. The condition is
// upstream's, it is cheap, and correctness here should not rest on a traversal order that a later
// pass is free to change. It is kept, and the sweep's result is recorded rather than dressed up as
// a pass.
//   - Both blocks are ordinary statement blocks. A value or loop block is named by a high-level
//     terminal that expects to find it, and merging it away breaks that terminal's structure.
//   - The block is not some terminal's fallthrough. Merging across a fallthrough would pull the
//     predecessor's instructions into a region the fallthrough was meant to sit outside of.
//
// # Phis in a merged block become loads
//
// A block with one predecessor can still hold phis, left behind by an earlier construction. Each
// has exactly one operand by definition, so it is not a merge at all: it is an alias, and after the
// blocks are joined there is no join for it to sit at. Upstream rewrites each into a `LoadLocal` of
// its single operand, appended to the predecessor before the merged instructions, and this does the
// same. Dropping them instead would leave the phi's value undefined at every later read.
