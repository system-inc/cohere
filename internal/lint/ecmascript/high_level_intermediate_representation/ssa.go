// Single static assignment form: rename every definition so each value is written exactly once,
// and insert phi nodes where control from several predecessors rejoins.
//
// This is Braun et al., "Simple and Efficient Construction of Static Single Assignment Form"
// (CC 2013), in the sealed-block form upstream uses. React's own specification of the pass is at
// `compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/docs/passes/02-enterSSA.md`, and the shape here
// follows it closely enough that the two can be read side by side.
//
// # Why Braun rather than Cytron
//
// The textbook construction computes the iterated dominance frontier, places empty phis at every
// block in it, then renames in a second walk over the dominator tree. Braun places a phi only when
// a lookup actually crosses a join with disagreeing predecessors, which means it never places one
// that redundancy elimination would immediately remove, and it needs no dominance frontier at all.
//
// That last point is why this does not consume `internal/lint/ecmascript/control_flow_graph`'s dominator tree.
// `AnalyzeDominators` is generic over `control_flow_graph.Graph[E]` and `control_flow_graph.Block[E]`, which are
// that package's own types; this graph is `Function` and `BasicBlock`. There is no conversion, and
// writing one would mean materialising a second graph purely to compute a frontier this algorithm
// does not use. Dominance is still what CORRECTNESS is stated against - see `VerifySSA` - but it is
// computed there, over this graph, for checking rather than for construction.
//
// Stated plainly for the next pass built on this IR, because it is easy to plan around the wrong
// answer: NOTHING in `internal/lint/ecmascript/control_flow_graph` applies to this graph without a conversion that
// does not exist. Its dominators, its dataflow solver, and its path analysis are all generic over
// `Graph[E]`. A pass here that wants any of them either writes the conversion or, as this does,
// computes what it needs over `Function.Blocks`, which is already in reverse postorder.
//
// # The doubled finally, and why it does not reach here
//
// `controlflow` lays a `finally` body out TWICE, and three consumers have been bitten by it. For
// this pass it would be a correctness bug rather than a nuisance: two layouts of one body give a
// binding two definitions that are not a merge, and construction over that mints a phi where the
// source has no join.
//
// It does not reach here, and that was verified rather than assumed. Lowering emits the finally
// body ONCE and jumps to it from every path that must run it; see `lowerTryStatement`. Checked
// empirically on `try/finally` and `try/catch/finally`, both of which produce a single finally
// block whose predecessors are the normal and abrupt paths. That is a real join, and a phi placed
// there is correct.
//
// # The one property everything rests on
//
// A block may be processed only after every predecessor that is not a back edge, so that a lookup
// into a predecessor finds a finished answer. `Function.Blocks` is in reverse postorder, which is
// exactly that guarantee, and `Finalize` establishes it. A caller that restructured the graph
// without re-running `Finalize` gets silent nonsense, which is why `Construct` re-runs it.
//
// # Loops, which is where a construction that looks right on straight-line code breaks
//
// A loop header is reached from before the loop and from the back edge, and the back edge's block
// has not been processed when the header is. Braun's answer is the incomplete phi: when a lookup
// reaches a block with unprocessed predecessors, mint the phi's result immediately, record it as
// the block's definition so the loop body's reads bind to it, and leave the operands to be filled
// when the last predecessor lands. Recording the definition BEFORE recursing is also what stops the
// lookup recursing forever around the cycle.
//
// # What is deliberately not here
//
// Redundant-phi elimination is a separate pass, `EliminateRedundantPhis`, in ssa_eliminate.go.
// Reclassifying `const`/`let` after renaming - upstream's
// `rewrite_instruction_kinds_based_on_reassignment` - is NOT implemented, because nothing in cohere
// reads `InstructionKind` yet and a reclassification no pass consumes is untested by construction.
package high_level_intermediate_representation

// Construct converts a function to single static assignment form, in place, and recursively for
// every nested function.
//
// After it returns: every identifier that a source binding takes is written exactly once, every use
// names the definition that actually reaches it, and `BasicBlock.Phis` holds a phi wherever a
// binding's value depends on which predecessor control arrived from.
//
// # What this cannot do for you, and how to tell
//
// A variable reference lowering left as `LoadGlobal` carries a name rather than a value, so there
// is nothing here to rename and no phi to place for it. That is correct for a true global and wrong
// for a local, and lowering produces the latter for EVERY reference when it was given no type
// checker. `Construct` cannot distinguish the two cases. `Lower`'s comment carries the measurement;
// the short version is that SSA over an unresolved function is well-formed, empty of phis, and
// meaningless.
//
// # Captures, and what renaming does and does not do at a function boundary
//
// A variable a nested function closes over IS tracked: lowering populates `FunctionExpression.
// Captures` and `Function.Context`, and the nested body reads it as `LoadContext` rather than
// `LoadGlobal`. `Construct` recurses into nested functions, so both sides are in single-assignment
// form.
//
// What renaming does NOT do is unify the two sides, and a pass must not assume it did. The capture
// and the captured value are separate identifiers in separate tables, because a `Place` is only
// meaningful against the table of the function holding it. The edge between them is positional:
// `FunctionExpression.Captures[i]` is the enclosing function's value and `nested.Context[i]` is the
// nested function's, naming one source binding from the two sides. A pass following a value into a
// closure walks that pairing.
//
// The capture is bound at the point the closure is CREATED, which is what makes it a value rather
// than a name. For `let n = 1; if (c) { n = 2; } const g = () => n;` the capture names the phi that
// merges the two versions, so `g` closes over what actually reaches it. A later write through
// `StoreContext` is a definition inside the nested function and is versioned there; it is NOT
// reflected back into the enclosing function's versions, so a pass asking what the OUTER `n` holds
// after calling `g` must still treat that as unknown.

	// Phis from a previous run are dropped, because this pass APPENDS them and cannot reconcile

	// 221 to 1,730.
