// Scope dependencies: what each reactive scope reads from outside itself.
//
// This is React's `propagateScopeDependenciesHIR` (development bundle line 47327) run over this
// graph. oxc transcribes it at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_inference/propagate_scope_dependencies_hir.rs`; where the
// two disagree React wins, and each disagreement is recorded at the line that resolves it.
//
// # What this pass computes, and what a "dependency" actually is
//
// A reactive scope memoizes a group of values together. To know when to recompute them, the scope
// needs its INPUTS: the values it reads that were produced before it began. Those inputs are
// dependencies, and a dependency is not an identifier -- it is an ACCESS PATH rooted at one.
//
//	ReactiveScopeDependency { Identifier, Reactive, Path []DependencyPathEntry }
//	DependencyPathEntry     { Property string, Optional bool }
//
// So `props.a.b` is one dependency: root `props`, path `[a, b]`. This matters because a scope
// reading only `props.a.b` should not invalidate when `props.c` changes, and because the dedup
// predicate compares the whole path. Upstream's `areEqualPaths` (bundle line 47352) compares each
// entry's property AND its `Optional` flag, so `a?.b` and `a.b` are DIFFERENT dependencies. That
// asymmetry is reproduced here rather than simplified; see `DependencyPathEntry.Optional`.
//
// # The three fields this pass writes, and why they are all one pass
//
// `ReactiveScope` has eight fields. `scopes.go` filled `id`, `range` and `loc` and stopped, naming
// `dependencies`, `declarations` and `reassignments` as belonging here. That boundary was checked
// mechanically before this file was written rather than taken on trust: every writer of the three
// fields across all of oxc was enumerated, and the initial producer of each is this pass alone
// (`propagate_scope_dependencies_hir.rs` lines 111, 1812 and 1857). Every other write is a later
// `prune_*` or `merge_*` pass mutating what this one created, and none of those exists here. The one
// exception found was `propagate_early_returns.rs:199`, a second `declarations` producer, which is
// the pass `scopes.go` had already assigned elsewhere.
//
// # Its input is the GRAPH, not the scope table, which is why three stages had to land first
//
// The single most surprising thing about this pass is that it never reads a scope side table to
// find its subjects. It recovers scopes by walking blocks for a `Scope` TERMINAL, through
// `ScopeBlockTraversal` (bundle 20758). React's `keyByScopeId` (46602) is six lines of
// `if (block.terminal.kind === 'scope')`.
//
// Measured before `BuildReactiveScopeTerminals` existed, this graph held 3,306 scopes in the side
// table and 0 reachable from the CFG. That zero was the denominator, not a gap: `collectDependencies`
// keys its output map on scope ids obtained only from that traversal, and `visitDependency` and
// `visitReassignment` are both gated on the scope stack being non-empty. A port written against the
// side table would have terminated, passed every fixture, and produced nothing -- the characteristic
// failure of this pass is an empty output that looks plausible. Three stages (alignment, merging,
// terminal construction) closed it, and the count is now 2,874 reachable.
//
// The lesson generalised into the instrument this package now uses: a writer-check confirms the
// OUTPUT field belongs to this file and is silent on whether the file's INPUTS exist. Both levels
// have to be checked, and the second level is "is the type ever CONSTRUCTED", not merely declared.
// `Optional` used to be the standing example; optional-chain lowering now constructs it and its
// sidemap is an input to this pass.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: oxc sorts a collection React does not
//
// `ReactiveScopeDependencyTreeHIR::new` in oxc sorts its hoistable objects so optional-first entries
// precede non-optional ones, with a comment claiming this "matches the TS behavior". React does no
// such sort (bundle 46967): it iterates `hoistableObjects` in insertion order and raises a hard
// `CompilerError.invariant('Conflicting access types')` when two entries disagree, where oxc
// silently takes first-wins via `or_insert_with`.
//
// React is the truth, so no sort is performed here. The divergence is recorded rather than split
// because the conflict behavior is already reproduced directly: inputs retain insertion order and
// `ScopeDependencies.Conflicts` exposes disagreements rather than silently choosing the first.
//
// # Termination is a single ordered walk, with no fixpoint anywhere
//
// There is no worklist and no iteration to convergence. `CollectScopeDependencies` makes ONE pass
// over the blocks in order, maintaining a stack of active scopes. Every block is visited once, every
// instruction once, and every operand once. The dependency tree is built by insertion and read once
// by `deriveMinimalDependencies`, whose recursion is over a tree whose depth is the longest property
// path and whose nodes are finite and fixed before the walk begins.
//
// This is deliberately narrower than the passes that prepare its inputs. Non-null propagation is a
// separate bounded dataflow pass and optional-chain recovery is a separate structural traversal;
// both finish before this collector receives their sidemaps. `TestDependencyCollectionIsASinglePass`
// pins the walk here, not those producers.
//
// # The distribution that proves these dependencies are real
//
// A count cannot separate a working pass from one that collects nothing, so the headline is a
// CROSS-TABULATION of dependencies per scope against scope member count, over 400 corpus files and
// 677 outermost functions. The control cell is scopes carrying ZERO dependencies: a pass that
// collected nothing would put every scope there, and a pass that over-collected would empty it.
//
// See `TestDependencyDistributionIsReal`, which pins the shape rather than the corpus numbers.
