// TestAssumedInvokedFunctionsRecognisesEachCallShape covers every arm that admits a function.
//
// # The arms overlap in this lowering, measured rather than assumed
//
// A mutation sweep removing any SINGLE arm leaves every case below passing, which reads as three
// dead arms. It is not: removing the whole of `collectInvocations` fails all four positive cases, so
// each is genuinely detected. What the sweep actually shows is that this lowering routes one source
// shape through several arms -- `callback()` reaches the hook-argument arm as well as the direct-call
// arm, and a returned callback reaches the return arm as well.
//
// The arms are kept separate anyway, because they are upstream's and because the overlap is a
// property of how this tree lowers calls rather than a property of the analysis. A source shape that
// lowers differently -- and `getAssumedInvokedFunctions` exists to handle several -- would lose
// coverage silently if the arms were collapsed to whichever one happens to fire today.
//
// The negative case is the one that matters. A false positive here is the dangerous direction: it
// lets the hoistable analysis descend into a callback that may never run, and a read hoisted out of
// an uncalled function moves a load to somewhere it can throw. So a fixture that declares a callback
// and never calls it must report nothing, and it is asserted rather than assumed.
