// TestPrunedScopesAreRecordedRatherThanCompared pins upstream's split into two visitor methods.
//
// `visitScope` runs `validateInferredDep` over the scope's dependencies; `visitPrunedScope` does not,
// it only adds the id to `prunedScopes` (`ValidatePreservedManualMemoization.ts:413` and `:441`).
//
// Running one arm for both is not a shape difference. A pruned scope still carries the dependency
// table entry it was assigned, so comparing it re-reports whatever its surviving twin already agreed
// about. Measured on the fixture below: two scopes each carry `propA.x` and `x`, the second is
// pruned, and upstream emits a single guard naming exactly that pair.
//
// The fixture is a program run through the real pipeline rather than a tree built by hand, because a
// hand-built tree asserts what someone believed the pipeline produces. It needs a type checker:
// without one `DropManualMemoization` never recognises the call, no marker is inserted, and nothing
// is pruned -- a first version of this test asserted against an untyped lowering and reported zero
// pruned scopes, which would have passed whichever arm ran.
//
// # What this does NOT catch, stated because a guard that cannot fail is worse than none
//
// It pins the SHAPE the defect needs, not the behaviour. Every call site passes nil for the
// dependency table, so `compareInferredDependencies` returns immediately and moving it back above
// the `Pruned` check changes no output -- measured, that mutation survives. The behavioural assertion
// becomes possible when the third firing condition is ungated, and belongs in the score test at that
// point.
//
// Kept anyway because the shape is the load-bearing half: a live and a pruned scope carrying the
// same dependencies is what makes the arm split matter, and if a future change stops producing that
// shape the reason this code exists has quietly evaporated.
