// The post-dominator tree is checked against the DEFINITION rather than against the algorithm.
//
// A block B post-dominates a block A when every path from A to a `Return` passes through B. That is
// established here by deleting B from the graph and asking whether any `Return` is still reachable
// from A, using a plain reachability walk that shares no code and no bug with
// `computePostDominance`. An implementation checked against a second copy of itself proves only
// that the copy was faithful.
//
// This matters more here than it would for a helper of the same size elsewhere. A post-dominator
// tree that is built but wrong does not fail loudly: it answers "this instruction runs
// unconditionally" with confidence, and the rule consuming it turns that into a diagnostic on
// somebody's code. Cooper-Harvey-Kennedy in particular degrades quietly when its node ordering is
// wrong, because `intersect` walks two positions toward each other and a bad order makes it settle
// on a node that dominates neither input.

// reachesAReturnWithout reports whether any `Return` terminal is reachable from start without
// passing through excluded.
//
// Deliberately a naive walk over `EachSuccessor` with a visited set. It is the definition written
// out, and its only job is to disagree with the tree when the tree is wrong.
