// TestBothPathsAgreeOnEveryPluginDefault is the gate on removing the hand-written lines.
//
// The live config names all forty plugin-default rules by hand, which reproduces oxlint's behaviour
// in the wrong layer. Removing those lines is only safe if the plugin declaration resolves the same
// forty, and this is what shows it: the config is loaded as written, then loaded again with every
// plugin-default line stripped, and the two results are compared rule by rule.
//
// Without this the removal IS the change, and a silent disagreement between the two paths looks
// exactly like a successful migration.
//
// # This guard was vacuous once, and the reason generalises
//
// The first version read `Load`'s result. `Load` merges the plugin defaults into `Rules`, so a rule
// arriving only through the declaration is indistinguishable there from one named by hand -- the
// exact distinction this test exists to measure. Checked by deleting three plugin-default lines from
// a copy of the live config: the test passed and reported all forty still named by hand.
//
// The shape: a test comparing two paths cannot read the surface where they have already been merged,
// and that surface is usually the convenient one because it is what every consumer uses. Reading the
// file directly is why this can now fail.
//
// # The severity difference, which is real and is the reason nothing is being removed yet
//
// The two paths agree on WHICH rules run and disagree on how loudly. The hand-written lines say
// `error`; `warn_correctness` contributes `warn`, and the inventory records all forty as `warn`.
// So the hand-written lines are not reproducing the gate's behaviour, they are strengthening it --
// forty rules currently fail this build that only warn in the tool being replaced.
//
// That is a decision somebody made and did not write down, and it is not this test's to reverse.
// The test therefore asserts membership exactly and reports severity rather than requiring it to
// match, so the difference is visible instead of blocking or being smoothed away.
