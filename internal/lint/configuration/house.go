/*
 * Zero config is the house stack (Kirk, 2026-10-04, #bfxz13m).
 *
 * A project with no CohereSettings.json, or one whose chain names no `cohere:` set, gets every set we
 * pick, each where the program shows it fits: cohere:typescript on every file, cohere:react on a file
 * that imports react or holds JSX, cohere:next on a file that imports next or is one of Next's own
 * files, and cohere:tailwind on every file when the project's stylesheet is Tailwind's. The evidence is
 * the program, never package.json: a dependency the code never imports applies nothing.
 *
 * Each file resolves through an ordinary configuration, one per combination of the per-file sets, so
 * every rule of a chain (departures, overrides, options, plugin defaults) means in zero config exactly
 * what it means in an `extends`. A rule a set the file does not get would have turned on reads as off
 * for that file, with the set's reason, so coverage says why it did not run rather than that nobody
 * configured it.
