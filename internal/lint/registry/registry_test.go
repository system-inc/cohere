// A rule that exists on disk and never registers compiles, tests green in its own package, and
// never runs. That is the worst defect this tool can carry: the file says the rule is enforced, the
// gate says the tree is clean, and neither is lying about what it knows.
//
// This was not hypothetical. Two boundary rules were written, tested, and left out of the registry;
// nothing failed until this test existed.
//
// The comparison is against `rule.Registered()` rather than against the text of `registry.go`. It
// used to read that file for the identifiers a hand-maintained list mentioned, which was the only
// thing available when the list was written by hand. Reading the live catalog is strictly stronger:
// a mention proved a name appeared in a file, while a registration proves the rule is loaded into
// the process that will run it. It also catches the failure mode self-registration introduces,
// where a rule package nothing imports contributes nothing and does not fail to compile.
