/*
 * ESLint 10.8.1's own test rows for every core rule cohere registers, replayed through cohere's rule
 * (#jjfa7qb). Each rule's authority is whoever wrote it, not whichever reimplementation we ported from,
 * and these rows are what ESLint's authors believe each rule does.
 *
 * The rows are vendored in testdata/eslint-corpus/eslint-10.8.1, one file per rule, each with ESLint's
 * verdict recorded when it was extracted (internal/lint/tools/eslint_corpus/extract.mjs, which nothing
 * runs). Every row runs as a module named Case.ts in both engines. A row agrees when cohere reports
 * findings at the same places ESLint does: the same start and end offsets, not only the same text.
 *
 * Every row that does not agree is listed in known-gaps.json under its rule, with the way it disagrees,
 * and the list is held exactly: an unlisted disagreement fails, a listed one that now disagrees
 * differently fails, and a listed one that now agrees fails until it is taken off. The list only shrinks
 * on purpose. Kirk's resolution order decides each one: first principles, and ESLint when that is
 * unclear. A divergence kept on first principles is recorded at the rule's line as well as here.
 *
 * COHERE_ESLINT_CORPUS_WRITE_GAPS=1 rewrites the list from what the run found, for a wave that settles
 * rows. Read the diff it leaves: a row leaving the list is the point, a row joining it is a regression.
