// The sweep above runs every rule through rule_testing.Run, which walks with no checker. 154 of the

// passed while their typed half never ran. prefer-arrow-callback's shared arm was the proof: its own
// regression test panicked, all 111 upstream fixtures passed, and the sweep above passed, because the
// arm sat behind a checker. Adding a shape could not fix that; the harness was the gap (#qa9nttp).
//
// So the corpus is also built into one typed program, every shape at every path, and one walk runs
// every registered rule over it. One build rather than one per rule and shape is what makes the typed
// half affordable. The walk contains a rule's panic to that rule and names it (cf5afb6), so this reads
// the crashes the walk names rather than recovering on its own, and a run with several crashing
// rules names every one.
