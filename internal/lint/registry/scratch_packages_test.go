// scratchPackageSuffixes are the names porters give throwaway packages.
//
// The convention arose on its own: several porters independently reached for an isolated package
// when the shared rule package would not compile, and independently named it for their rule plus a
// marker. It is a good pattern and the brief now sanctions it. What it lacks is an ending.

//
// The isolated-package route is how a porter measures anything when a sibling has the shared package
// red at compile time, and `-run` scoping cannot rescue a compile error. So these get created, and
// the instruction to delete them afterwards lived only in a brief nobody re-reads at the end.
//
// Eight were left behind in one session. Most were harmless clutter. One was not: a scratch copy
// registered the same rule name as the real package, so `TestEveryRuleIsRegistered` failed for every
// other agent in the tree, and the failure named a package none of them had heard of.
//
// That is the cost this catches. A porter who forgets pays for it themselves at their own commit,
// rather than everyone paying for it until a coordinator notices.
//
// The suffix list is deliberately narrow. A real package named for what it does will not end in
// `iso` or `probe`, and if one ever legitimately does, adding it to an exemption here is a decision
// somebody makes on purpose rather than a guard quietly widening.
