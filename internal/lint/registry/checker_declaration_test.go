// A rule that reads the checker must say so, and this is what checks that it did.
//
// `f4793b6` made the exclusive checker lock conditional on `Rule.NeedsTypeChecker`, which recovered
// about 45% of the lint phase: the lock is held across a file's whole walk rather than around one
// query, so acquiring it serialized every file against every other. Nothing paid for that at the
// time, because zero of the 93 rules then registered read the checker.
//
// **That is no longer the shape of the catalog. 2026-08-25: 44 of 216 registered rules declare it**,
// so the lock is acquired on any file one of those 44 applies to. The saving is still real and it is
// conditional now rather than total. Dated because a rule count in a comment decays silently: this
// sentence said "zero" for as long as it took someone to notice, and nothing failed in between.
//
// **The saving is bought with a claim each rule makes about itself.** A rule that declares false and
// then reads `ctx.TypeChecker` receives nil, and nil does not announce itself: the rule either
// panics into a lost file with a coverage note, or takes a nil-guarded path and reports a wrong
// answer quietly. The second is worse and is the likelier of the two, because most checker helpers
// guard nil internally.
//
// So the declaration is only as good as something checking it, which is the same argument as the
// fixture-pair guard. This reads each rule's source for a `ctx.TypeChecker` reference and requires
// the declaration to match.

// TestCheckerDeclarationShareStillSupportsTheConclusion makes the claim in the comments falsifiable.
//
// Two doc comments quote how many rules declare `NeedsTypeChecker`, because the number decides
// whether the conditional checker lock is a blanket saving or a conditional one. Both were wrong for
// an unknown stretch, in the direction that tells a reader the lock costs nothing:
// `rule.go` said one of 112 and `checker_declaration_test.go` said zero of 93, while the real figure
// had reached 44 of 216.
//
// Nothing failed in between, which is the whole problem. A dated comment is honest about being a
// measurement and still says nothing when it expires, so this asserts the claim instead.
//
// # Why this is a band and not the bare equality it used to be
//
// It was written as `wantRegistered == 216 && wantNeedsChecker == 44`, deliberately, so that adding
// any rule forced a reader to revisit the conclusion. That was right when a rule landed every few
// days. It stops being right during a porting wave: the total moves on every single commit, so the
// guard fires constantly on the one number it does not actually care about, and the fix each time is
// to retype a literal. A guard that cries on every commit is one a porter learns to satisfy without
// reading, which is the opposite of the review it was built to force.
//
// **The claim being defended is the share, not the total.** The comment in `rule.go` concludes that
// the checker acquisition is "a real saving and nothing like the blanket one this comment used to
// describe". That conclusion survives 44 of 216 and 44 of 300; it would not survive 200 of 300,
// where the lock is skipped so rarely it is no longer worth the branch, nor 2 of 300, where the
// blanket claim it replaced would be true again.
//
// So the band is on the ratio, wide enough that ordinary porting cannot trip it and narrow enough
// that a real shift does. When it fails, the fix is not to widen the band: it is to read both
// comments and decide whether what they conclude still follows.
