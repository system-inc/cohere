// Rules used to register bare, and `bareRuleName` stripped any prefix before matching, so a config
// key spelled `bogusplugin/no-alert` resolved exactly like the correct one -- measured, same six
// findings, no warning. ESLint is not that forgiving: an unknown rule key is fatal there, so a
// wrong prefix killed the whole run twice in one day while `s l --linter both` kept printing a
// comparison against a linter that had linted nothing.
//
// Registering the real upstream name removes the translation step. One name is right everywhere,
// and a wrong prefix now fails here rather than in ESLint.
//
// A plugin rule must carry its plugin's namespace; an ESLint core rule must carry none, because
// upstream has none. Today that is 272 namespaced against 146 bare, and both halves are correct:
// the shape of a name is decided by what upstream calls it, never by a house preference for one
// form. Anything else is the inconsistency this guard exists to catch.
//
// This test once lived beside the parity suite and was argued in its terms, because a namespaced
// registration was invisible to the parity count. That catalog is gone, and the property is not:
// `cohere --rules` prints these names and `configuration.settingFor` splits them on the `/`
// boundary, so a name that lies about its plugin still reaches a user and still fails a config
// lookup. The guard outlived the instrument that motivated it.
