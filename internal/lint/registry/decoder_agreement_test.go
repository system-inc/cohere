// Every registration's decoder hands its rule the type the rule reads.
//
// Run takes `options any`, so nothing at compile time compares the type a Decode returns with the
// type its rule passes to rule.OptionsAs. `unified-signatures` asserted a pointer over the value its
// decoder returned, every configured option was ignored, and every fixture stayed green because the
// fixtures handed Run options directly instead of decoding them (#qmvkf83). OptionsAs now panics on
// such a disagreement, but only when a run reaches it with decoded options, so this test makes every
// rule reach it: each decoder is fed the smallest option that means "configured" (an empty object,
// or an empty option list), and whatever it decodes is handed to that rule's own Run.
//
// A decoder that refuses the empty input (a required key, a strict schema) is skipped and counted,
// and the count has a floor, so a harness that silently decoded nothing cannot pass.
//
// Running a rule is not reaching its options read: a rule that calls OptionsAs only inside a listener
// for a node kind the probe source lacks would run, pass, and check nothing (#zwd43jn). So each rule
// must also move rule.OptionsAsReads, unless it is named in optionsReadUnreachableOnProbe. Measured
// when this landed: 172 of 172 reach it. The counter is global, which is why this test is not
// parallel: a parallel test calling OptionsAs at the same moment would make a rule look reached.
