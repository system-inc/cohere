// FileRead is one path a reader asked the file system about, and whether it was there.
//
// Absence is recorded as carefully as presence: a design system that looked for an entry point and did
// not find it depends on that file staying absent, since creating it changes the design system.
//
// A present path keeps the size and modification time it had when it was first asked about, so a
// cache hashing it afterwards can re-stat and decline to record a file that moved between the read and
// the hash, the race the run cache closes the same way for its own inputs.

// its read set, so a cache keyed on that set cannot miss a file it forgot (#pyhm2t2). Writes panic,
// because a reader that writes is not a reader, and a cached verdict cannot replay a side effect.
