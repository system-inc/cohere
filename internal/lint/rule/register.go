// author writes and a decoder is the config layer's business. Keeping them in one Registration
// means a rule is declared in exactly one place while neither package has to import the other: the
// rule package builds the decoder with a generic helper and hands it over as an opaque function.

	// Decode turns this rule's single option element into its own options struct, or nil if the
	// rule takes no options, which is the common case. A config giving a rule with Decode more than
	// one option element is refused by name, never truncated.

	// DecodeOptionList is Decode for a rule whose upstream schema takes more than one option
	// element: `eqeqeq`'s `["error", "always", {"null": "ignore"}]`, or `consistent-this`'s
	// variadic `["error", "self", "vm"]`. It is handed every element after the severity as one JSON
	// array, which is upstream's `context.options`, or nil for a bare severity. Set at most one of
	// Decode and DecodeOptionList; which one is set is how the config layer learns the rule's arity.
	DecodeOptionList func(list []byte) (any, error)
	// DecodeAt is Decode for a rule whose options name a place on disk, so decoding needs to know
	// where the config was written and which project is being checked. It takes one option element,
	// as Decode does, and is handed nil for a bare severity so it can fill in a default from the base.
	// Set at most one of Decode, DecodeOptionList and DecodeAt.
	//
	// It exists because a path in a committed config is read on every machine and in every worktree.
	// An absolute one is right on exactly one of them, and a rule whose root matches none of the files
	// it is handed declines them all, which is the inert-rule defect with a path in front of it.

	// `boundary-no-project-import` was enabled and inert for months, declining every file because
	// its configured directory was empty, which is correct behavior for a misconfigured guard and
	// indistinguishable from a rule with nothing to report. Marking it required turns that silence
	// into a failure.

// package, so two ports landing at once conflicted on a file neither of them was really changing.
// Now a rule is two new files and no shared edit, which is the difference between porting a few
// rules at a time and porting a family at once.
//
// A duplicate name panics rather than overwriting. Two rules answering to one name is not a
// resolvable state: the config addresses rules by name, so whichever one lost would be silently
// unreachable while its tests kept passing, which is the same shape as the inert-rule defect this
// tool exists to catch. Failing at startup makes it a crash in the first second rather than a gap
