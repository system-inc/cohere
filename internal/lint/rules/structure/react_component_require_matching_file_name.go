// nextJsConventionFileBaseNames are the base names Next.js reads from the filesystem by name.
//
// This is the framework's grammar, not an allowance. Next resolves a route segment by finding a file
// literally called `page` or `layout`, so the file's name is fixed before anyone writes the component
// in it, and there is no rename that would satisfy this rule without breaking the route. The
// component name in these files is free to carry what the path cannot, and it does: measured on the
// ahra tree on 2026-10-01, 77 of 80 `page.tsx` files default-export a `<Route>PageRoute` and every
// layout a `<Segment>Layout`. That is a naming convention of its own, and enforcing it would be a
// separate rule rather than a reading of this one.
//
// The list is Next 16.3.1's own, read from the installed build rather than from memory:
// `FILE_TYPES` and `HTTP_ACCESS_FALLBACKS` in `next/dist/build/webpack/loaders/next-app-loader`
// (layout, template, error, loading, global-error, global-not-found, not-found, forbidden,
// unauthorized), plus page, route and default, plus `mdx-components`, which Next resolves at the
// project root. The metadata image conventions are below, because they take a numeric suffix.
//
// It is wider than `FileContext.IsSpecialNextJsFile`, which names six of these plus route. Widening
// that one would move every rule reading it, `react-component-require-named-export` among them, and
// whether `template.tsx` should be exempt from those is their question rather than this rule's.
//
// The base name alone decides, as it does in `FileContextFor`, so a `page.tsx` outside an app
// directory is exempt too. Measured, there is none in the ahra tree, and such a file's name is
// lowercase, which no component name can match anyway.

//	valid:   Table.tsx                  two components             react/no-multi-comp's finding
//	invalid: FinanceFloorView.tsx       export function FinanceFloorViewRow() { ... }
//	invalid: financeFloorView.tsx       export function FinanceFloorView() { ... }
//
// One component per file is `react/no-multi-comp`'s rule, and it is strict. This is the other half
// of the same promise: once a file holds one component, its name is the component's, so the tree can
// be navigated by name in both directions forever. Knowing `FinanceFloorViewRow` means knowing the
// file, and seeing the file means knowing the component.
//
// # What counts, and which way the detector errs
//
// Top-level declarations only, because the file's component is the one the file declares, not a
// component nested inside it. Each of these is one component, named by its binding:
//
//	a capitalized function declaration
//	a capitalized const holding an arrow or function expression
//	a capitalized const holding memo(...) or forwardRef(...), bare or React.-qualified
//	a capitalized const holding Object.assign(Root, ...), when Root is one of the above
//	a class extending Component or PureComponent, declared or assigned to a const
//	an anonymous default export of a function, which has no name
//
// A function or function literal is a component if either predicate in `react_detection.go` says so:
// `IsLikelyReactComponent` (a `properties` or `props` parameter, or a top-level JSX return) or
// `HasJsxOrReactHookCalls` (JSX or a hook call anywhere in a bounded walk). The house rules use one or
// the other, and this one takes both, because of which direction a miss costs here. This rule
// reports when exactly one component is found, so a detector that misses one of two components
// reports the other under a false premise: the file is not named for it because it is not the file's
// component. A detector that over-counts only makes a file read as "several", which is silent. So
// the detector is built to over-count, and classes are counted although no house rule counts them,
// for the same reason: an error boundary class beside a function fallback is two components, and
// counting only the function would report the fallback against the boundary's file.
//
// # A wrapper absorbs the function it wraps
//
// `function MenuItemComponent() {}` with `export const MenuItem = React.memo(MenuItemComponent)` is
// one component, `MenuItem`, implemented by the function it names. Five files in the structure
// library are written this way. Counting both would make every one of them silent as "several", so
// a wrapper's first argument, when it is an identifier naming a function this file declares, is
// dropped from the count and the wrapper stands for it. Type assertions around the call are looked
// through, since `React.memo(Inner, compare) as typeof Inner` is how three of those five keep a
// generic component's type parameter.
//
// The structure library's compound components take the same treatment:
// `export const Calendar = Object.assign(CalendarRoot, { Header: CalendarHeader })` is the component
// `Calendar`, implemented by `CalendarRoot`. Unlike memo, `Object.assign` builds plenty of things
// that are not components, so it counts only when its first argument names a component this file
// declares. Both shapes were found by the first run on the ahra tree, where each reported an
// implementation function against the file named for its wrapper.
//
// # When the rule stays silent, and whose finding that is instead
//
//	zero components               nothing to name the file for
//	two or more components        react/no-multi-comp reports every one after the first, and this
//	                              rule waits until the split makes the question answerable
//	an anonymous component        react/display-name reports it; once named, this rule compares
//	a Next.js convention file     the framework owns the name; see nextJsConventionFileBaseNames
//	a test or stories file        see companionFileSuffixes
//	a .ts or .js file             a component file is a .tsx or .jsx file
//
// `index.tsx` is not exempt. The house bans barrel files, so an `index.tsx` that declares a component
// is a component living under a name that is not its own, and it reports like any other. A barrel
// that only re-exports declares no component and is silent here; whether it should exist is not this
// rule's question.
//
// # No fix
//
// The repair is renaming a file, which changes every import of it across the tree. That is a rename
// with its own tooling and its own review, not a lint edit applied unattended to one file, and an
// edit to one file cannot express it anyway.
