// Declaration order used to decide whether the declaration itself was reported, and that was wrong.
//
// The previous version of this test pinned the order dependence deliberately, reasoning that the
// use site is reported either way and that fixing it costs a second walk of the file for a second
// finding about the same rename. Both halves of that were true. The conclusion was still wrong,
// and the reason is the fix rather than the finding.
//
// On the declaration-first ordering the rule emitted one finding carrying one fix, and that fix
// renamed the *usage*. So `CardProps` became `CardProperties` at the call site while the
// declaration kept its old name, and the result parses and does not compile:
//
//	dangling.ts(2,34): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'CardProperties'
//
// A fix engine's parse guard structurally cannot refuse that, because the output is syntactically
// valid. And declaration-first is the conventional ordering, so it was the common case.
//
// The trade was priced as "a second finding about the same rename" when what it actually bought was
// "the fix does not break the file". Recorded at length because the reasoning was careful and still
// reached the wrong answer: it weighed the cost of the walk against the value of the finding, and
// the finding was not the thing at stake.
