	Id: "noInvalidateCacheInOnSuccess",
	Description: "This invalidates the cache from inside an `onSuccess` handler. Use the " +
		"`invalidateOnSuccess` option instead, which puts the invalidation list next to the " +
		"request that makes it necessary and runs it automatically. Hand-written invalidation in a " +
		"handler drifts from the request over time: somebody adds a field the request now affects " +
		"and the handler does not know about it, so the stale read appears somewhere unrelated and " +
		"nobody connects it back to this line.",
}

// NetworkNoInvalidateCacheInOnSuccess flags a cache invalidation inside an onSuccess handler.
//
//	valid:   useMutation({ invalidateOnSuccess: ['users'] })
//	valid:   networkService.cache.invalidate(key)                (outside onSuccess)
//	invalid: useMutation({ onSuccess: () => networkService.cache.invalidate(key) })
//	invalid: useMutation({ onSuccess() { apiService.cache.invalidate(key); } })
//
// Three things must line up before this reports: an `onSuccess` property, a `.cache.invalidate(...)`
// call somewhere inside it, and a receiver that reads as a service. The original matches the
// receiver by name, accepting `networkService` exactly or anything containing "service" or
// "Service", and this reproduces that rather than tightening it, since a rule that reported every
// `.cache.invalidate` inside an `onSuccess` would catch caches that are not the network's.
//
// The property is matched in both spellings, `onSuccess: () => {}` and the method shorthand
// `onSuccess() {}`, which reach different node kinds. Enumerated before the listener: the original's
// ESLint selector matches a Property, and the shorthand is a Property in ESTree while it is a method
// declaration here, so a port reading only the assignment form would miss half the call sites.
//
// No fix. Moving an invalidation into the option means deciding which keys belong there and whether
// anything else in the handler depended on running at that moment.

// test, and the difference is deliberate: this rule is about where an invalidation lives, so it has
// to know it is looking at the network's cache; that rule is about how a key is written, and a
// typo'd key is a defect whatever the cache belongs to.
//
// The name test is the original's and it is deliberately loose: `networkService` exactly, or any
// name containing "service" in either casing. Tightening it would be a different rule, and loosening
// it further would catch caches that have nothing to do with the network layer.
