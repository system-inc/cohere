//
// Ported from `structure/boundary-no-project-theme-value`.
//
// # The cache is built from the type graph rather than from the filesystem
//
// This is a deliberate divergence from the original and the only one in this rule.
//
// The original discovers its theme files by walking `process.cwd() + "libraries/structure/source"`
// with `readdirSync`, parsing each match with a second `@typescript-eslint/parser` instance, and
// caching the result in a module-level variable. It does that because ESLint hands a rule one file
// at a time and gives it no way to see the others. Cohere has the whole program, so this reads the
// same files out of `ctx.Program` instead.
//
// Two defects are avoided rather than ported, and both are ones this codebase has already paid for:
//
//   - `process.cwd()` makes the verdict depend on where the linter was invoked from. That is the
//     invisible dependency `import-require-path-alias` had, fixed there by taking the root as a
//     required option rather than reading it from the process.
//   - The original wraps its parse in `catch { return {} }`, so an unparseable theme file yields an
//     empty cache and the rule goes quiet. Quiet is indistinguishable from clean, which is the
//     failure this whole tool exists to remove.
//
// **The two mechanisms were measured against each other rather than assumed equivalent.** The
// filesystem walk finds 28 files; the program holds 29 whose names end in `Theme.ts`. The extra one
// is `source/theme/hooks/useTheme.ts`, which the original's `^[A-Z]\w*Theme\.ts$` pattern correctly
// rejects for its lowercase first letter. It exports one hook and no theme interface, so it
// contributes nothing either way and the two mechanisms see the same 28 contributing files. The
// pattern is reproduced here anyway, so the difference stays at zero rather than at "currently
// harmless".
//
// # Only inside the library
//
// A project using its own values is the system working. The boundary is one-directional: the
// library may not reach into the project, and the project may extend the library freely.
