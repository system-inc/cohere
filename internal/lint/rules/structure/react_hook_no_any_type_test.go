// This rule has no upstream corpus on either side. It is a house rule Kirk asked for directly, so
// every fixture below was written from reasoning about our own code rather than imported from a
// reference implementation, which makes this a weaker artifact than a ported rule with an imported
// floor. The next reader should know which kind they are holding.
//
// # How both a resolvable and an unresolvable React live in one harness
//
// `rule_testing`'s tsconfig sets `types: []` and points at a fresh temp directory, so `@types/react`
// can never resolve in a fixture and there is no `node_modules` to reach. The passing case
// therefore supplies its own React through a sibling declaration file using `declare module
// 'react'`, which is a global augmentation the program picks up from any file in the include set;
// `reactHookNoAnyTypeReactDeclarations` below is the minimum of `@types/react` this rule reads. The
// failing cases simply omit that file, which is what makes `import React from 'react'` resolve to
// nothing and every hook call come back `any`.
//
// So the two states are one map entry apart, and the same fixture text can be run both ways. That
// is used deliberately in `TestReactHookAnyTypeSeesTheDifferenceTheDeclarationsMake`, which is the
// only test here that proves the rule is measuring resolution rather than measuring syntax.

// checker's own name for the same type, which is derived through a completely different path
// (`TypeToString`, a linkname to an upstream method, no offset arithmetic anywhere).
//
// `flags` happens to be field zero of the mirror, which makes it the least likely field in the file
// to drift. That is a reason to expect this test to pass, not a reason to skip writing it: an
// upstream reordering that moves `flags` off zero would silently turn this rule into one that
// reports nothing, or reports on everything, and nothing else in the tree would notice.
