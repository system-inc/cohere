// The fix rewrites only the specifier string, never the import clause, and that restraint is the

// case so a default import becomes a named one, which means the fix is guessing at the replacement
// module's export shape from inside a rule that cannot see it. Rewriting the string is the part
// that is always correct; if the bindings also need to change, the compiler says so immediately and
// a human makes that call with the module in front of them.

		// wrapper files that put the finding on line 1 while the author's
