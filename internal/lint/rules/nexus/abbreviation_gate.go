// The candidate gate, expressed as lookups rather than as a regular expression.
//
// This decides whether a name is worth spending the rest of the rule on, and it runs once per
// identifier in the tree. Measured on the ahra tree that is 667,947 calls, and the regular
// expression form cost 1,830ms of a 2,825ms total, 64.8% of all rule time. Benchmarked against the
// real pattern: 2,247 ns/op for the regex, 29.68 ns/op for this shape, a factor of 76.
//
// The regex is not badly written and the port was faithful. Go's regexp is RE2, which does not
// backtrack, and a ninety-alternative alternation has different constant factors there than under
// V8. **A regex that is cheap in JavaScript is not automatically cheap in Go**, and a per-node gate
// is where that difference gets multiplied by two million. Nothing about the rule's logic changed.
//
// Every alternative in that pattern was a literal word, or a literal word plus a case boundary, so
// there was no backtracking behavior to preserve and a map lookup answers the same question. The
// pattern itself is gone: it was kept as the specification this gate was tested against, and once
// the vocabulary moved into abbreviations.json a pattern derived from the same file would only have
// compared the file to itself.
//
// The direction of error is the whole discipline here: this must be a **superset** of what the
// vocabulary reports. A false positive costs one cheap traversal that reports nothing. A false
// negative silences the rule for that spelling, and a rule that stops firing looks exactly like a
// clean run. `abbreviation_gate_test.go` asserts the superset property by running the vocabulary
// itself, with no gate in front of it, over 82,367 distinct identifiers from the ahra tree, and
// requiring the gate to admit every name it reports. Two earlier attempts at this gate both lost
// `elapsedMs`, and a hand-written list does not contain the case its author misread.

// abbreviationGate is the vocabulary turned into the lookups below, one set per form.
//
// Derived from abbreviations.json rather than written out, so a word added to the file is admitted
// by the gate in the same edit. When these were four hand-written maps beside a hand-written list,
// the two could disagree, and a word the gate did not admit was a word the rule never judged.
