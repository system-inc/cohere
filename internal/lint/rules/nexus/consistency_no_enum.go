// ConsistencyNoEnum bans TypeScript's enum keyword, including const enum.
//
// An enum compiles to a runtime object with a reverse mapping, which does not tree-shake and is
// larger than the union it replaces. Its type narrows to an opaque branded value rather than to the
// literal string, so a value that is obviously "A" stops being usable as "A" at a boundary. The
// `as const` pattern has neither problem and matches the shape generated GraphQL already uses.
//
// No fix, deliberately. Migrating an enum means choosing the replacement name and updating every
// reference, which is a judgment the rule cannot make from one declaration.
