// # Where it came from
//
// Kirk's ruling of 2026-10-01, replacing `require-atomic-updates`, which is off in both engines.
// Upstream reports any write after an await to something read before it, and on ahra none of its 39
// findings was a read-modify-write: they were timestamps, flags, cached tokens and restores in
// `finally`. This rule asks the narrower question that names an actual lost update.
//
// # The conditions, all of which hold for a finding
//
//  1. The function can suspend: an async function or a generator. A suspension is an `await`, a
//     `yield`, or a `for await` loop's step, and only one in this function counts, never one inside a
//     nested function.
//  2. The write is a plain `=` or an arithmetic or bitwise compound assignment (`+=`, `-=`, `|=` and
//     the rest). `??=`, `||=` and `&&=` are check-then-act rather than read-modify-write and are
//     never judged. Destructuring assignments are not judged.
//     A write through a store's write call (`updateAccount(key, value)`, `cache.set(key, value)`) is
//     judged exactly as a plain `=` of its last argument to that store entry; storeAccessOf says what
//     makes a read call and a write call one store, and the read call is then the only way that
//     entry is read.
//  3. The target is a variable, or a static member path (`a.b`, `a['b']`, `this.c.d`) rooted at a
//     variable or at `this`. A computed key whose value the syntax does not settle (`a[k]`) is judged
//     only in a compound assignment, which reads and writes through one evaluated reference; under a
//     plain `=` two reads of `a[k]` are the same property only if `k` held still, which nothing here
//     can show.
//  4. Someone else can write the target during the suspension:
//     - a variable declared outside this function, or a local of it that a nested function writes;
//     - a member path rooted at `this`, at a variable declared outside this function, at one of this
//     function's own parameters (the caller holds the object), or at a local a nested function
//     references.
//     A local nobody else can see is never judged: `let total = 0; total += await next()` loses
//     nothing, because there is no one to lose it to.
//  5. The new value is computed from the target's prior value, read before a suspension that runs
//     before the write, on some path. The read is either in the assigned expression itself
//     (`x = x + await y`, with the compound form's implicit read counting as first), or reached
//     through a `const` of this function whose initializer read it (`const old = s.count; await f();
//     s.count = old + 1`), through any chain of such consts.
//  6. The value is MODIFIED rather than copied, and computed HERE. `console.log = original` writes back exactly the value
//     it saved, which is a restore, and restoring a saved handler in `finally` is the pattern the
//     upstream rule reported most on this tree. Any operation on the value (arithmetic, a call, a
//     member read, a spread into a new literal) makes it a modification. Two things are not:
//     - an awaited call's result, which is the callee's answer rather than this function's
//     computation (`token = (await refresh(token)).next` sends the old value out and writes back
//     what came back);
//     - a write after this function itself overwrote the target, between the read and the
//     write, which is the save-and-restore protocol (`const original = console.log; console.log =
//     filter; try { await run(); } finally { console.log = original.bind(console); }`).
//
// # How "before a suspension" is decided
//
// Inside the assigned expression, by evaluating it in order along each path: `&&`, `||`, `??` and
// `?:` fork, a branch's value carries only what that branch read, and a suspension marks stale every
// read already taken on its path. That is what keeps `x = c ? x + 1 : await f()` silent: the read and
// the suspension are on different paths. And `x = x || await f()` is silent too, because on the path
// that suspends the value written is `await f()`, not `x`.
//
// Across statements, through the function's control-flow graph: from the end of the const's
// declaration to the start of the write, is there a path through a suspension that does not pass the
// declaration again? Again is what keeps a const declared inside a loop honest, since each iteration
// binds a fresh one. A suspension whose expression contains the write (`await save(s.count = old + 1)`)
// runs after it and is not counted.
//
// # What it deliberately does not see
//
// A value laundered through a `let`, an alias of the object (`const snapshot = state; ...
// snapshot.count`), and a computed key under a plain `=` are all silent. So are a store read
// destructured straight into a pattern, a store whose key is a member read or a call, a store whose
// read and write functions are declared in different files, and a store object mutated in place and
// written back verbatim (`state.cursor = c; writeState(state)`). Each is a missed finding rather than
// a false one, which is the direction this rule errs in.
//
// No fix and no suggestion: the repair is a restructuring (re-read after the suspension, a lock, or
// an atomic update on the store), and which one is right is the author's call.
