// The gate must be a superset of the regex it replaces, and this is the only thing that proves it.
//
// The asymmetry is the whole point and it is stated in the rule's own comment: a false positive here
// costs one cheap traversal, while a false negative silently stops the rule firing, and a rule that
// stops firing looks exactly like a clean run. So over-approximation passes and under-approximation
// fails loudly.
//
// The corpus is every distinct identifier in the ahra tree rather than a hand-written list, because
// a hand-written list is exactly where this goes wrong. Two independent attempts at this gate lost
// `elapsedMs` to the same subtle cause: splitting a name at every uppercase letter puts `Ms` in its
// own word and discards the lowercase letter before it, and that boundary is precisely what the
// `[a-z]Ms($|[A-Z])` arm tests. A list somebody wrote from reading the pattern does not contain the
// case they misread.
