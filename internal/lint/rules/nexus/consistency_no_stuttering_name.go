			"repeats the field instead of saying which " + name + " this is. Rename the value for what it " +

// ConsistencyNoStutteringName rejects a placeholder name that stutters against its own field.
//
//	valid:   response.json()
//	valid:   parsed.value
//	invalid: outcome.outcome
//	invalid: result.result
//
// Why the stutter specifically, and not every generic name: a name is read where it is used, not
// where it is declared, so the question is never "is this word generic" but "does this word still
// carry anything by the time someone reads it." Most generic names are fine, because the value dies
// three lines later. `const response = await fetch(url); return response.json()` needs no better
// word; response is exactly what it is.
//
// The stutter is the case where the name provably carries nothing, and it is self-evident from the
// text alone. `outcome.outcome === 'Unreadable'` reads as a value whose own name had nothing to say,
// so it borrowed the field's word and said it twice.
//
// This started as a ban on generic names at the declaration and measured 1,355 hits across the repo,
// of which roughly forty were real. The rest were HTTP responses named response and process results
// named result, living four lines and correct as written. The stutter is the part of the idea that
// survived contact with the codebase, and that ratio is the reason this rule is narrow rather than
// thorough.
//
// No fix. The right noun is the judgment this rule exists to demand, and a rule cannot pick it.
