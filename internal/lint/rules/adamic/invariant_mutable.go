/*
 * InvariantMutable reports a value seen through a wider type at a place that type lets you write (#drbrp8c).
 *
 *     invalid: const animals: Animal[] = dogs;             animals.push(cat) puts a cat in dogs
 *     invalid: const pen: { pet: Animal } = kennel;         pen.pet = cat does the same
 *     invalid: const animals: Map<string, Animal> = dogs;   animals.set('Tom', cat)
 *     valid:   const animals: readonly Animal[] = dogs;     nothing can be written through it
 *     valid:   const pen: { pet: Animal } = { pet: rex };   the literal is held by nobody else
 *
 * # The hole
 *
 * tsc relates a mutable location covariantly: an element of `Dog[]` is accepted where an element of
 * `Animal[]` is wanted, because reading one is safe. Writing one is not, and tsc lets the wider name
 * write. Each shape above is accepted by tsc 6.0.3 under strict and fails on Node with `dog.bark is not
 * a function` (probes h03, h04, h13, h19, h20 on #drbrp8c). Adamic's rule: a mutable location is
 * invariant and a `readonly` one is covariant, which is what tsc already does for `readonly T[]`.
 *
 * # How
 *
 * The file's flow.Walker finds every place a value goes into a typed slot and pairs the value's parts
 * with the slot's. At every pair the target marks mutable, whatever the wider type can write there must be
 * something the original can read: the target's slot type must be assignable to the source's. tsc already
 * proved the other direction when it accepted the site, so together the slot is invariant. That catches a
 * literal widened in a mutable slot (`{ kind: 'Circle' }` into `{ kind: string }`) and a callback slot
 * narrowed the wrong way, and leaves alone a slot whose two types differ only where writing back is safe, as
 * a DOM event handler's `this` does on every element seen as `Element`.
 *
 * A read-only source slot made writable is the same hole one step removed (#gvzdft9): `readonly pet: Animal`
 * is covariant, so it may hold a Dog, and `{ pet: Animal }` over it writes a Cat there. tsc accepts a read-only
 * property as a writable one, though it refuses `readonly T[]` as `T[]`, so the rule reports the property
 * whatever its two types are; readonlyMadeWritable says where not.
 *
 * A method taking a narrower parameter than the wider type passes is the hole a caller opens (#gvzdft9 shape 5):
 * tsc compares a method's parameters in both directions, so `{ put(dog: Dog) }` passes as `{ put(animal: Animal):
 * void }`, and a Cat passed through the wider type reaches code reading a Dog. The rule asks the walk for methods
 * and judges their parameters one way, a function's being tsc's own under strictFunctionTypes. A generic method is
 * related as tsc relates it (#bbtfx99): one with type parameters of its own is instantiated in the context of the
 * other, so `{ put<T extends Dog>(dog: T) }` as `{ put(animal: Animal) }` is a Dog parameter under an Animal one,
 * and Promise's `then` is the same `then` under two promises. A method's return is not paired, as no method was
 * before.
 *
 * It began as identity, by the checker's identity relation, and the four consumers measured why not: an
 * `HTMLElement` seen as an `Element` reported its event handler slots, which differ only in `this` and are
 * safe to write back. `{ x }` against `{ x; y?: number }` is mutually assignable, and that hole is
 * no-optional-widening's.
 *
 * A class instance is nominal-class's: it requires identical type arguments, which covers every mutable
 * part, so this rule does not descend into one. The slot that holds one is this rule's (#5y54eyj): nominal-class
 * rightly accepts a Dog as an Animal, which is the value, and `Dog[]` seen as `Animal[]` is still a cat written
 * into the dogs, a TypeError in Node whether the animals are interfaces or classes. Where nominal-class reports
 * the pair itself, a value that is no instance or one with other type arguments, this rule leaves it, so the
 * two rules never report one hole twice.
 *
 * # No fix
 *
 * Every repair changes a type (add `readonly`, or copy), so none preserves meaning, and the edit engine
 * applies only fixes that do.
