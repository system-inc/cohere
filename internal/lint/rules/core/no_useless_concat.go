// NoUselessConcat flags a `+` whose two adjacent operands are both literal strings.
//
//	valid:   var a = 1 + 1;
//	valid:   var a = 'foo' + bar;
//	valid:   var foo = 'foo' +\n 'bar';
//	valid:   var string = (number + 1) + 'px';
//	valid:   (1 + +2) + `b`
//	invalid: 'a' + 'b'
//	invalid: foo + 'a' + 'b'
//	invalid: `a` + `b`
//
// # The operands are the ADJACENT ones, not the node's own children
//
// Concatenation associates left, so `foo + 'a' + 'b'` parses as `(foo + 'a') + 'b'` and the outer
// node's left child is a whole binary expression rather than a literal. Upstream walks INTO that
// child to find the rightmost thing actually next to the operator, and symmetrically walks into the
// right child to find its leftmost. Without that descent the rule reports only the innermost `+` of
// a chain and misses `foo + 'a' + 'b'` entirely, which is one of upstream's own reporting cases.
//
// The descent stops at anything that is not itself a `+` concatenation, which is what makes
// `(1 + +2) + ` + "`b`" + ` clean: the left operand's rightmost element is `+2`, a unary expression, not a
// literal.
//
// # Parentheses have to be skipped, and the corpus says so rather than my guessing
//
// ESTree produces no node for a parenthesized expression, so upstream's `node.left` is already the
// literal inside the parentheses. typescript-go produces one, so without skipping, every
// parenthesized operand reads as a non-literal and goes silent. This is not a hypothetical drawn
// from the brief's warning: upstream's corpus writes `(foo + 'a') + ('b' + 'c')` and asserts TWO
// findings, and measured against the installed build at 10.8.1, `('a') + 'b'`, `'a' + ('b')` and
// `('a') + ('b')` all report.
//
// The skip runs before the descent AND inside it, because either can be wrapped.
//
// # What counts as a string literal
//
// Upstream's `astUtils.isStringLiteral` is a string-valued `Literal` or ANY `TemplateLiteral`,
// including one carrying substitutions. Measured: a template with a substitution added to a
// string reports. That is wider than it first reads, since such a template is not a constant,
// and reproducing it is deliberate. A numeric literal is not a string literal, which is why
// `1 + '1'` and a template added to a number are both clean.
//
// This parser splits templates into two kinds, so both are named: a template with no substitutions
// and a template expression with them.
//
// # The same-line requirement
//
// Upstream compares the left operand's END line against the right operand's START line, so a
// concatenation broken across lines is left alone as a deliberate layout choice. Written here as a
// scan for a line break in the gap between the two operands, which is the same question asked the
// other way round. The two spellings were compared over ten shapes rather than assumed equivalent,
// including multiline templates on either side and a block comment carrying a newline between the
// operands, and they agree on every one. The multiline template is the case that could have
// separated them, because a template ENDING on line 2 keeps the operator on line 2.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// At the `+` OPERATOR, not at the expression. Upstream overrides the location to the operator
// token's own span, which is why its corpus asserts a one-character range at column 5 for
// `'a' + 'b'`. Reporting the node would point at column 1 and no message-id fixture could see it.
//
// # No fixer, matching upstream
//
// Upstream declares none and marks the rule frozen. Joining the two literals is not always a
// spelling change: the halves may use different quote styles, one may be a template carrying a
// substitution, and the line break the author chose is often what makes a long string readable.
