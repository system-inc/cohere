// Most commas in JavaScript are separators rather than operators: array elements, object properties,
// arguments, and the declarators of one `var` all use the token and none of them is this rule's
// subject. The comma *operator* is the one in expression position, and it is worth a rule because
// the two readings look identical and the wrong one is the common one. `a = b(), c()` binds tighter
// than it reads: the assignment takes `b()`, the comma sequences it with `c()`, and the value the
// author probably wanted is discarded.
//
// # Two exemptions, and both are about intent rather than safety
//
// The `for` statement's initializer and update are the one position where sequencing is the only way
// to say the thing, so upstream exempts them outright. The `for` *condition* is not exempt, since a
// condition discarding its left half is the defect the rule is about: `for (; a, b ;)` reports while
// `for (a, b;;)` and `for (;; a, b)` do not.
//
// Everywhere else, wrapping the sequence in its own parentheses is read as the author saying the
// sequencing was deliberate, and the rule stands down. That is the `allowInParentheses` option and
// it defaults to on.
//
// # Where our tree and upstream's disagree about the shape, and why the port is not structural
//
// Two differences, and each would ship a defect on its own.
//
// **Chained commas are one node upstream and several here.** ESTree flattens `a, b, c` into a single
// `SequenceExpression` holding three expressions, and reports once, at the first comma. typescript-go
// parses the same source as nested `BinaryExpression` nodes with `KindCommaToken`, so a listener
// firing per node would report twice on `a, b, c` and three times on `a, b, c, d`. Measured against
// the installed rule: both report exactly once, at column 2. So this walks to the outermost node of a
// chain, reports there, and points at the chain's leftmost comma. A parenthesized inner sequence is
// genuinely a separate `SequenceExpression` upstream, and the parenthesis is what stops the chain
// here too, which is why `a, (b, c)` reports once at column 2 and `(a, b), c` once at column 7.
//
// **The parentheses upstream counts are not all nodes here.** Upstream tests parenthesization
// positionally over tokens, reading the token before and after the node at depth 1, and it demands
// *two* levels for a node the grammar already parenthesizes: the tests of `if`, `while`, `do...while`
// and `switch`, and the object of `with`. In our tree those grammar parentheses are not nodes at all
// -- `if ((a, b));` produces exactly one `KindParenthesizedExpression` -- so counting node levels
// gives the same answer at one level that upstream gets at two. The arrow body is the exception and
// the reason `requiresExtraParens` survives here in any form: `a => (b, c)` does produce a
// `ParenthesizedExpression`, because those parentheses belong to the expression rather than to a
// statement's grammar, so the arrow body needs two nodes where every other position needs one.
// Measured against the installed rule, which reports `a => (b, c)` and is silent on `a => ((b, c))`.
//
// The consequence is that this rule counts paren *nodes* and upstream counts paren *tokens*, and the
// counts differ by one in five of the six positions. That is fidelity to the decision rather than to
// the mechanism: the inputs that report are the same inputs.
//
// # One measured divergence, in emission order rather than in content
//
// Under `allowInParentheses: false` a nested pair like `(a, b), c` reports twice, and upstream emits
// the inner finding before the outer one while this emits the outer first. Both walks are pre-order;
// what differs is which node is outer. Upstream's outer node is the flattened sequence whose reported
// comma is the LATER one, and its inner node is the parenthesized child whose comma is earlier, so
// pre-order and source order happen to agree there and disagree here.
//
// Five of 264 differential rows differ this way and no row differs in content: same count, same
// spans, same message. It is invisible downstream because `report.Write` sorts every finding by file
// and position before printing, so the printed order is source order either way. Stated rather than
// corrected, because reordering emission would mean holding findings back to sort them and the only
// thing it would buy is agreement with an artifact nobody reads.
//
// Measured by running all 66 probe inputs under all four option shapes through both implementations.
//
// No fix. Upstream ships none, and the repair is a judgment the rule cannot make: splitting a
// sequence into statements is only correct where the expression is already a statement, and the
// alternative repair of adding parentheses silences the finding without addressing it.
