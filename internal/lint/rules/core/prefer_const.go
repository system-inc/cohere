// # This rule inverts its siblings, and the inversion decides the whole design
//
// `no-const-assign` and `no-class-assign` report a write that should not have happened, so a write
// their detection misses is a missed report on code that was already wrong. This rule reports the
// *absence* of any write, so a write its detection misses turns correct code into a finding, and
// the fix it offers rewrites that correct code into a `const` that throws at runtime. A missed
// write category here is a false positive with a broken repair attached, which is the strictly
// worse direction.
//
// Every judgment below therefore fails toward silence. Where the rule cannot see the whole picture,
// it says nothing rather than guessing.
//
// # Why this reads the checker
//
// Same reason as the siblings: the discrimination is name resolution. Upstream's clean cases
// include `let x = 0; { let x = 1; foo(x); } x = 0;`, where the inner `x` genuinely is const-able
// and the outer one is not, and the two are spelled identically. Node identity rather than
// declaration kind, because both anchors here are `KindVariableDeclaration` and kind cannot
// separate them at all. The distinguishing input is `let a = 1; { let a = 1; a = 2; }`, where a
// kind comparison sees the inner write as a write to the outer binding and silences a finding that
// identity reports; it has its own fixture and its own mutant.
//
// # The structural half does not come off the shelf here, and that is measured
//
// `no-const-assign` uses `ast.IsWriteAccess` as its write detector and documents it as probed. It
// was probed again for this rule, on this rule's own corpus, because the brief is right that a
// shelf function's doc comment is a claim. It has a gap:
//
//	[...w] = []        IsWriteAccess reports false
//	({...w} = {})      IsWriteAccess reports false
//	[a, ...w] = []     IsWriteAccess reports false
//
// A rest element inside a destructuring *assignment target* is a `KindSpreadElement` or
// `KindSpreadAssignment` whose identifier the accessor declines. For the sibling rules that gap is
// a missed report. For this rule it is exactly the false positive described above: upstream carries
// `let predicate; [typeNode.returnType, ...predicate] = foo();` as a *clean* case, and a rule
// trusting the shelf sees zero writes to `predicate` and reports it. So the write detection here is
// `reference.WritesToBinding`, which is `ast.IsWriteAccess` with the spread arms added, and the gap
// has its own fixture in both corpora.
//
// That wrapper was written three times, once per rule, before a census read the whole corpus at
// once and lifted the union onto the shelf. The lifted version also closes a gap this rule's own
// wrapper had: a parenthesis sitting directly around the identifier made the climb bail on its
// first step, so `let w = 1; [...(w)] = xs;` read as never written and was reported as convertible
// to `const`. Applying that suggestion produces code that throws `TypeError: Assignment to constant
// variable` at runtime. Measured with a control on the unparenthesized form, which was always
// correct.
//
// # What counts as never reassigned
//
// Two shapes qualify, and they are upstream's:
//
//	an initializer and no writes at all       `let x = 1; foo(x);`
//	no initializer and exactly one write      `let x; x = 0;`
//
// The second needs more than a count, because `const` has to be initialized where it is declared.
// A single write only converts when it is an assignment that is a statement of its own, in the same
// statement list as the declaration, so `let x; { x = 0; } foo(x);` and `let a; while (a = foo());`
// and `let a; if (true) a = 0; foo(a);` and `let a; foo() || (a = 0);` are all clean upstream and
// all clean here. `initializingAssignment` is that test, and it is ESLint's canBecomeVariableDeclaration:
// the assignment could be rewritten into the declaration where it stands, and nowhere else could.
//
// A destructuring assignment converts too. `let a; ({a} = obj);` becomes `const {a} = obj;`, which is
// why ESLint reports it, as long as the pattern could become a declaration's pattern: every target in it
// a plain name, and every name either undeclared or a `let` beside this one in the same statement list.
// A property target, a parameter or a binding from an enclosing scope cannot be declared there, so
// `let predicate; [typeNode.returnType, predicate] = foo();` stays clean. ESLint asks the outer-scope
// question of the pattern's top level only; this asks it at every depth, which can only fall silent.
//
// Where the finding points follows ESLint. With an initializer it names the declaration. Without one it
// names the write, since that is the line that becomes the declaration, unless the binding is read
// before that write, in which case it names the declaration, where the read-before-write is visible.
//
// A for-in or for-of head is its own shape. `for (let x of [1,2,3]) { foo(x); }` binds a fresh `x`
// per iteration with no initializer to speak of, so zero writes is enough and upstream reports it.
//
// # What it does not catch, on purpose
//
// `var` is untouched. Upstream leaves `var x = 0;` clean, and converting a `var` changes hoisting
// and scope rather than only mutability, which is a different rule's judgment.
//
// A binding written from a nested function is never reported, whatever the count. `let a; function
// foo() { a = bar(); }` is clean upstream, and the reason is not stylistic: the write may run any
// number of times including zero, and `const` cannot express it. The write detector sees these, and
// `initializingAssignment` refuses them, since the write's statement is not in the declaration's list.
//
// A pattern whose bindings disagree is where the `destructuring` option lives, and the two answers
// are both defensible. See PreferConstDestructuring.
//
// # The fix, and when there is not one
//
// The repair is `let` to `const` over the declaration list's keyword, and it is a fix rather than a
// suggestion: it preserves meaning wherever the rule fires, since the rule only fires when nothing
// reassigns the binding. But it is *conditional*, and the conditions are upstream's:
//
//	every declarator in the list must be const-able     `let x = 1, y = 2; y = 3;` rewrites `y`
//	                                                    to const and breaks the file
//	every declarator must have an initializer, unless   `const y;` does not parse
//	the list is a for-in/of head
//
// Where either fails the finding is still reported and simply carries no fix, which is what
// upstream does and is the honest answer: the diagnosis is right and the repair is a judgment call
// about splitting the declaration.
