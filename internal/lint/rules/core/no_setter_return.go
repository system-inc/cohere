//	valid:   ({ set foo(val) { if (val) { return; } } })
//	valid:   ({ get foo() { return 1; } })
//	valid:   ({ set: function(val) { return 1; } })
//	valid:   ({ set foo(val) { var inner = function() { return 1; }; } })

//	invalid: class A { set a(val) { return val; } }
//	invalid: (class { static set a(val) { return this._a; } })
//
// A setter's return value is discarded by the language: assignment evaluates to the right-hand side
// no matter what the setter hands back, so `obj.a = 1` is `1` whether the setter returns `2`, throws
// the value away, or never returns at all. That makes a returning setter one of two things, and both
// are worth a line. Either the value is dead and the `return` is doing nothing, or the author
// believed it would reach a caller, in which case the code is wrong in a way nothing at runtime will
// ever say out loud.
//
// A bare `return` is legal and common, because it is control flow rather than a value. That is the
// discrimination the whole rule turns on, and it is why the check is on the argument rather than on
// the statement.
//
// # Why this is syntactic, and how that was established
//
// Upstream reaches for `ctx.scoping()` here, which usually means the algorithm lives in the semantic
// layer and the rule file is a thin caller. It does not mean that in this case. The two things it
// asks a scope are `is_set_accessor` and `is_function`, and both are properties of the enclosing
// syntactic construct rather than of any name binding. A setter accessor resolves no identifier;
// only the descriptor family below asks the checker, and only whether `Object` is the global.
//
// That was measured rather than reasoned. A throwaway probe ran this exact ancestry walk under the
// untyped harness against all 142 of upstream's cases, asserting the per-input diagnostic counts
// taken from the snapshot, and matched on every one. Disabling the function boundary in the same
// probe turned 15 of them red, so the green was a measurement and not a vacuous pass.
//
// The walk stops at the first function-like ancestor because a nested function is its own return
// target. `({ set foo(val) { var inner = function() { return 1; } } })` returns from `inner`, which
// is an ordinary function whose value is used, so nine of upstream's clean cases are exactly this
// shape. Checking only the immediately enclosing function would be wrong in the other direction: a
// `return` inside an `if` inside a `try` inside a setter is still the setter's, which is why this
// walks instead of reading one parent.
//
// # Setters declared through property descriptors
//
// ESLint also reports a setter declared through a property descriptor:
// `Object.defineProperty(foo, 'bar', { set(val) { return 1; } })`, and the same under
// `Object.defineProperties`, `Object.create` and `Reflect.defineProperty`. The port this rule followed
// left that family out, so ESLint's 23 descriptor rows read as missing (#jjfa7qb). ESLint wrote the
// rule and is right on first principles too: the descriptor's `set` is called by the same assignment
// and its value is discarded the same way.
//
// The recognition is the `descriptor` shelf's, shared with `getter-return`. Here it asks the checker
// whether `Object` or `Reflect` is the global, because ESLint's corpus pins
// `let Object; Object.defineProperty(foo, 'bar', { set(val) { return 1; } })` as clean: a local with
// the global's spelling is somebody else's method. An arrow written `set: val => val` returns its
// expression body, so that body is what reports, where ESLint reports it.
