// # The rule matches nothing until it is configured, and that is the whole reason it measured zero

// The audit beside this file records "violations in ahra: none" with a recommendation of Yes. That
// zero is not evidence the tree is clean: upstream's default pattern is `^.+$`, which every
// non-empty name matches, so an unconfigured rule cannot report. It is the class of zero the
// standard calls out. The rule is registered here and left unenabled; what it catches depends
// entirely on the pattern Kirk chooses.
//
// # The audit's zero is an unconfigured rule, not an unreachable one, and that was measured
//
// A sibling port in this batch found `react/prefer-exact-props` carrying the same audit verdict as
// this rule -- "Yes, violations: none" -- while being structurally incapable of firing here: its
// only reporting path reads `settings.propWrapperFunctions`, a SHARED ESLint setting that
// `rule.Context` has no path to and that ahra configures nowhere. The ruling is at
// `internal/lint/rules/react/forbid_prop_types.go:158-183`. So the audit's zero cannot by itself
// tell a clean tree from a rule that cannot report at all, and both readings had to be separated
// here rather than assumed.
//
// They are different mechanisms and this rule is the ordinary one. It reads `context.options`,
// which the config layer hands the rule, rather than `context.settings`, which it does not. Checked
// three ways, because a grep for the absent thing is the weakest of them:
//
//	the rule file names no shared setting        0 hits for context.settings / sharedSettings
//	its ONLY import is ./utils/ast-utils         which itself has 0 such hits
//	  (the control, react/forbid-prop-types, reaches the setting INDIRECTLY through
//	   util/propWrapper.js:21, so a rule-file grep alone would have missed it -- which is
//	   exactly why the import was traced rather than trusted)
//	driven executably over all 100 corpus cases  0 change verdict when a settings block is present
//
// The last is the one that settles it, and it carries its own control: the same harness runs
// `react/prefer-exact-props` on a reporting case from its own corpus and measures 0 findings
// without settings against 1 with, so the probe demonstrably CAN detect a settings dependency and
// refuses to report if that control stays flat. This rule's zero is therefore "nothing is
// configured yet", which a pattern fixes, rather than "nothing can be".
// # Four options, and each one gates a different arm rather than narrowing one filter
//
//	properties          object literal keys, member accesses, and shorthand values
//	classFields         class field names, public and private
//	onlyDeclarations    narrows everything to function declarations and variable declarators
//	ignoreDestructuring exempts a name a pattern RE-USES, never one it invents
//
// The last is the subtlest and the corpus pins it precisely. Measured against the installed rule
// with `ignoreDestructuring: true`:
//
//	let { category_id } = query                    clean   -- the name came from the object
//	let { category_id: category_id } = query        clean   -- same name, still re-used
//	let { category_id = 1 } = query                 clean   -- a default does not rename
//	let { category_id: category_alias } = query    REPORTS -- category_alias is a NEW name
//	let { a: b, ...other_props } = query           REPORTS -- a rest element always invents
//
// So the option asks "did this pattern coin this name", not "is this inside a pattern". A port
// reading it as the latter loses the last two rows and no count would say so.
//
// # Where ESTree's ObjectPattern goes here, and why the destructuring arm is two arms
//
// Upstream's whole destructuring branch keys on `parent.type === "Property"` with
// `parent.parent.type === "ObjectPattern"`, reading `parent.key`, `parent.value` and
// `parent.shorthand`. This tree spells the same source two different ways depending on whether it
// DECLARES bindings, and both had to be handled:
//
//	let { a: b } = x        KindBindingElement inside KindObjectBindingPattern
//	({ a: b } = x)          KindPropertyAssignment inside KindObjectLiteralExpression
//
// The binding form is the friendlier of the two, and it collapses upstream's three fields into
// two slots on one node: `PropertyName` is upstream's key when a rename happened and is ABSENT for
// a shorthand, and `Name()` is always the binding that comes into scope. So upstream's
// `parent.key.name === parent.value.name` test, which asks whether a rename happened, is here just
// "is PropertyName nil", and the shorthand flag needs no separate field at all.
//
// # The member-access arm is upstream's three-way split, and it is not a single condition
//
// Upstream's MemberExpression branch has three arms and they are not alternatives to one test:
//
//	the OBJECT of the access                      foo.bar        checks foo
//	the property of an assignment's LEFT side     foo.bar = 1    checks bar
//	an assignment whose right side is not itself
//	  a member access                             foo.bar = baz  checks bar
//
// The third is why `foo.no_under = boom.bam_pow` reports only ONCE, on `no_under`, while
// `foo.no_under = 2` also reports once: the right-hand `bam_pow` is the property of a member access
// being READ, and reading a property we may not own is not our naming decision. That distinction
// is reproduced rather than simplified, because collapsing it reports every property read in the
// tree the moment `properties` is on.
//
// # The global exemption, and where it diverges
//
// Upstream's `isReferenceToGlobalVariable` reads ESLint's global scope. Measured by mutation
// against the installed rule, it decides **2 of the 100 corpus cases**, both of them `Object` and
// `Array`:
//
//	node .../globalcount.cjs id-match id-match.json
//	  -> id-match: the global exemption changes 2/100 corpus verdicts
//
// Unlike `id-denylist`, whose corpus leans on ESLint's `globals` CONFIG for nine cases, id-match's
// corpus carries no `globals` languageOption and no `/* global */` directive at all, so both cases
// are real lib globals the checker resolves by itself. This port therefore reproduces the whole
// exemption with no divergence, through `idDenylistIsReferenceToGlobalVariable`, whose four
// resolution rows are documented on that function.
//
// # No fix
//
// Upstream offers none, and none is possible: the repair is to rename, and nothing here knows what
// the author meant. Renaming would also have to reach every reference, which is a refactor rather
// than a lint fix.
