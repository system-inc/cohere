// The six names are `undefined`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, `eval`, `arguments` and `globalThis`. None is a
// reserved word, so every one of these declarations parses and most of them run, which is the whole
// problem: the mistake produces no error at the line that makes it and surfaces somewhere else
// entirely, in code that reads the name expecting the global and gets the shadow.
//
// # This rule is the inverse of its siblings and it changes the shape
//
// `no-class-assign` and `no-ex-assign` anchor on a declaration and hunt writes to it. This one
// anchors on a declaration and asks a question about the declaration itself, so there is no search:
// every finding sits at the binding identifier the listener already has. That makes the bulk of the
// rule syntactic, and the coverage question moves from "did I find every write" to "did I find
// every way to declare a name", which is a longer list than it looks. Upstream's densest input,
// `function NaN(NaN) { var NaN; !function NaN(NaN) { try {} catch(NaN) {} }; }`, is six bindings in
// five scopes and reports six times.
//
// # Why it still reads the checker
//
// One carve-out, and it is not syntactic. A bare `var undefined;` is legal and harmless, because
// the binding is initialized to the global's own value and reading it gets exactly what reading the
// global would. It stops being harmless the moment anything assigns to it, and upstream carves out
// only the harmless form:
//
//	var undefined;                          clean
//	var undefined; doSomething(undefined);  clean, the reference is a read
//	var undefined; undefined = 5;           reports, at the declaration
//
// Deciding between the second and the third means knowing whether a given `undefined = 5` writes to
// *this* binding or to some other one. Upstream answers with `get_resolved_references`, a find-all
// references index we do not have; the equivalent question our checker answers is which declaration
// an identifier binds to, so this walks the file once and asks that of each write.
//
// Node identity rather than declaration kind, and here the trap is live rather than theoretical.
// Measured on our own checker:
//
//	function f(){ var undefined; } var undefined; undefined = 1;
//
// holds two `KindVariableDeclaration` nodes with distinct pointers, and the write binds to the
// outer one. A kind comparison calls the inner declaration a match, carves nothing out, and reports
// a binding upstream leaves alone. `var undefined; var undefined;` is the control: those two merge
// to one symbol with one declaration pointer, which is why upstream's clean case for it stays clean.
//
// The shorthand accessor is live too. `({undefined} = obj)` resolves through `GetSymbolAtLocation`
// to the shorthand property's own symbol, which reads exactly like a write to some other binding,
// so the carve-out would hold and the case would go silent. `GetShorthandAssignmentValueSymbol`
// answers the value side. Measured, not assumed: the plain accessor returns a
// `KindShorthandPropertyAssignment` declaration here and the shorthand accessor returns the
// variable.
//
// # What the carve-out deliberately does not cover
//
// Only `undefined`, and only a bare variable declaration. `let globalThis; globalThis = 5;` reports
// once and would report even without the write, because `globalThis` has no carve-out at all. A
// destructured `var [undefined] = [1]` reports too: the binding takes a value out of the array, so
// it does not hold the global's value and the reasoning behind the carve-out does not apply.
//
// # Enum members
//
// `enum Globals { undefined = 'undefined' }` is clean. An enum member is a property of the enum
// object rather than a binding in any scope, so nothing named `undefined` is shadowed and every
// later read of the bare name still finds the global. Upstream carves this out explicitly and it is
// the only TypeScript-specific judgment in the rule.
//
// No fix. The repair is a rename, which means choosing a name and deciding which later uses of the
// old one meant this binding rather than the global, and those are the same uses the rule exists to
// warn about.
