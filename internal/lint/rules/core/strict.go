// # A module collapses every mode into one

// Upstream's first act is `if (node.sourceType === "module") mode = "module"`, which overrides
// whatever was configured. So in a module the rule has exactly one thing to say: the directive is
// redundant, delete it. Every other mode, and the whole nesting apparatus below, applies only to a
// script.
//
// That matters more here than upstream, because this tree is essentially all modules: measured,
// 2,917 of 2,919 TypeScript files carry a top-level import or export, and the two that do not are
// still compiled as modules. So the mode option is nearly inert in practice and the rule is, in
// effect, a guard against somebody pasting a directive into a module.
//
// The script arms are ported in full anyway. They are not dead code -- a `.js` or `.cjs` file, or a
// file that loses its last export, reaches them -- and reproducing only the arm this tree exercises
// would be a port of the configuration rather than of the rule.
//
// # Three findings the author cannot fix by moving the directive
//
// `nonSimpleParameterList` is the sharpest: since ES2016 a directive inside a function with a
// default, rest or destructured parameter is a SYNTAX ERROR, so that code does not run at all.
// Upstream reports it and deliberately offers no repair, because the fix is a judgment about which
// half to change. `wrap` is its counterpart under the function form, where the function cannot be
// made strict without restructuring it.
//
// # The repair only ever deletes a whole statement
//
// Every fix this rule offers removes one directive statement, and never rebuilds a span. That is
// what makes it safe on TypeScript: a parameter annotation, a return type and a generic list all sit
// outside the statement being deleted and cannot be caught in it. Measured against the installed
// rule on annotated functions, which its own JavaScript corpus cannot contain.
//
// Five of the ten findings carry that repair and five do not, and the split is upstream's
// `shouldFix`: a directive that is merely redundant is removed, while one whose presence is a
// symptom of something else is reported and left alone.
