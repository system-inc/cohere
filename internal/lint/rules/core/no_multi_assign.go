// NoMultiAssignOptions carries upstream's one option.

// `IgnoreNonDeclaration` drops the bare-chain arm, leaving only the two arms that sit under a
// declaration. It defaults to FALSE, which is the safe direction for the zero value: an absent key
// and an explicit false mean the same thing, so unlike a default-true option this one does not
// invert when the config layer hands the rule nil. The pointer is kept anyway so the two stay
// distinguishable if the default ever moves, and so the decoder's own behaviour is testable.

// of an error the config layer turns into a nil the rule then reads as a zero value. That path is
// harmless for this rule, whose one option defaults to false, and it is written out anyway because
// the harmlessness is a property of today's default rather than of the code.
//
// The configured shape is the bare object rather than upstream's `[{...}]`: cohere's config layer
// strips the severity-and-options tuple before dispatch, so a fixture copying ESLint's spelling
// fails on every row.

//
// Upstream is written as three selectors and this is the same three, anchored the other way round.
// A selector language matches a child by naming its parent and the field it sits in; a kind listener
// receives the node and asks what its parent is. Same question, and the parent test is what makes
// `class C { [foo = 0] = 0 }` clean, because that assignment's parent is the computed key rather
// than the field.
//
//	VariableDeclarator > AssignmentExpression.init      an assignment as a declarator's initializer
//	PropertyDefinition > AssignmentExpression.value     an assignment as a class field's initializer
//	AssignmentExpression > AssignmentExpression.right   an assignment as another's right-hand side
//
// The third is dropped when `ignoreNonDeclaration` is set, which is exactly upstream's own
// conditional push onto the selector list.
//
// # What counts as an assignment, measured rather than assumed
//
// ESTree's `AssignmentExpression` covers all sixteen assignment operators, not just `=`, and
// upstream's selector therefore does too. Measured against the installed build at 10.8.1: every one
// of `= += -= *= /= %= **= <<= >>= >>>= &= |= ^= &&= ||= ??=` reports in `var q = w OP e`. The
// corpus writes only `=`, so a port reading the corpus alone would ship a rule silent on fifteen
// of them.
//
// `ast.IsAssignmentOperator` answers for exactly those sixteen and false for `==`, `+`, `&&`, `,`,
// `instanceof` and `??`, probed against this list rather than taken from its name.
//
// # Parentheses, which are load-bearing here in both positions
//
// Espree produces no node for a parenthesized expression, so upstream's `.init` and `.right` fields
// already see through them. Measured: `var a = (b = c);` reports and `x = (y = z)` reports.
// typescript-go does produce a node, so the initializer and the right operand are both skipped
// through before the kind is read, or those two inputs go silent.
//
// The reported SPAN keeps the parentheses that belong to the assignment's own operands.
// `var a = (b) = (((c)))` reports at column 9, which is the `(` of `(b)`, because that parenthesis
// is inside the assignment rather than around it. That falls out of reporting the assignment node
// itself and is asserted rather than assumed.

// nestedAssignmentIsChained answers whether this assignment sits in one of upstream's three slots.
//
// The slot is decided by the parent AND by which field of the parent holds this node, which is what
// the selector's `.init`, `.value` and `.right` say. Testing the parent kind alone would report
// `class C { [foo = 0] = 0 }`, whose assignment is the computed key rather than the initializer, and
// `a, b = c`, whose parent is a binary expression that is not an assignment.
//
// # Parentheses move the parent, which is where the first draft was wrong
//
// Espree gives a parenthesized expression no node, so upstream's `.init` and `.right` are already
// the assignment. typescript-go inserts one, and it goes on BOTH sides of the link: in
// `var a = (b = c);` the assignment's own `Parent` is the parenthesized expression rather than the
// declaration, so a switch reading `node.Parent.Kind` never sees the slot at all.
//
// So the climb is upward, and the downward skip stays too. The upward climb finds the real parent;
// the downward skip confirms this node is the one that field arrives at rather than some deeper
// assignment inside it. Both directions were measured: `var a = (b = c);` and `x = (y = z)` report
// upstream and went silent on the draft that only skipped downward.
