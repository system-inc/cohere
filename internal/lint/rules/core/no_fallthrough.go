// NoFallthrough reports a switch clause whose body runs on into the next clause.

// Falling from one case into the next is legal and occasionally deliberate, but far more often it
// is a missing `break`, and the two are indistinguishable from the source. So the rule asks for the
// deliberate case to be said out loud in a comment, and reports the rest.
//
// Examples of incorrect code:
//
//	switch (foo) { case 0: doSomething(); case 1: doSomethingElse(); }
//	switch (foo) { case 0: if (a) { break; } default: b(); }
//
// Examples of correct code:
//
//	switch (foo) { case 0: doSomething(); break; case 1: doSomethingElse(); }
//	switch (foo) { case 0: doSomething(); /* falls through */ case 1: doSomethingElse(); }
//	switch (foo) { case 0: case 1: doSomething(); }
//
// # Why there is no control flow graph here
//
// Upstream reaches for oxc's control flow graph (`ctx.cfg()`) and, in the same file, spends fifty
// lines warning that the reach is a hack: `get_switch_semantic_cases` is labelled black magic, told
// not to copy, and pinned to an open issue asking for a semantic interface instead. We have no such
// graph, and TypeScript's flow nodes are not one. They exist for *narrowing*, keyed on expression
// positions where a type could change, and `ast.FlowNode` carries `Antecedent` and `Antecedents`
// with no successor edges at all. There is no break instruction in it to find.
//
// So the analysis here is structural, over the statement tree, and for this question the tree is
// the better instrument rather than the weaker one. "Does control reach the end of this clause" is
// a property of how statements nest, and the constructs that make it interesting are all visible:
//
//	break/return/throw/continue   leave the clause outright
//	if                            leaves only when it has an else and both arms leave
//	try                           leaves when the finally leaves, or the try and the catch both do
//	switch                        a nested switch's break is its own; it never leaves the outer one
//	loops                         a break inside one belongs to the loop, not the switch
//
// The loop rule is what upstream's control flow graph gets right through a bypass edge and what the
// tree gets right by declining to credit the body, and both of upstream's `while (a) { break; }` and
// `do { break; } while (a)` fail cases turn on exactly it.
//
// The judgment here is close to `getter_return.go`'s `bodyDefinitelyExits` and is deliberately not
// shared with it, because the two ask different questions. That one asks whether every path leaves
// the *function*, so a `break` is not an exit and a `continue` is not an exit. This one asks
// whether every path leaves the *switch*, so both are, and a nested loop or switch swallows them.
// Sharing one walk would need a mode flag threaded through every arm, and the arms that would then
// differ are the majority.
