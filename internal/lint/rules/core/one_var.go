// Ported from `one-var` in ESLint 10.10.0, read from the clone at `lib/rules/one-var.js`. One
// option (a string enum or one of two object shapes), seven messages, and `meta.fixable` is
// `"code"`.
//
// All 296 of upstream's corpus cases were extracted from its own tester and replayed through the
// ESLint Linter API before any code was written -- twice, once under upstream's own parser settings
// and once under the TypeScript parser with `sourceType: module` that cohere always has. The two
// agree on every case, so nothing here rests on a JavaScript-only reading.
//
// # The walk is manual, because the rule is stateful and there is no exit listener
//
// Upstream registers ten `:exit` handlers to pop two stacks. This tree's listeners are pre-order
// only, so the whole traversal runs inside one `KindSourceFile` listener that pushes and pops the
// same frames around the same constructs. That is the shipped shape for a gather-then-judge rule.
//
// # Five places our AST differs from ESTree, and four of them move a verdict
//
// ESTree's `VariableDeclaration` is the statement AND holds the declarators. Ours splits it into a
// `VariableStatement` wrapping a `VariableDeclarationList`, and in a for-head the list stands alone
// with no statement above it. `oneVarStatementOf` picks whichever plays the statement's part, and
// getting it wrong moves every span and breaks every consecutive verdict at once.
//
// ESTree wraps an exported declaration in `ExportNamedDeclaration`, and that wrapper has no `body`
// array, so upstream neither reports a consecutive finding on an export nor repairs a combine on
// one. Ours has no wrapper at all. See `oneVarIsExported`, which carries the measurement and the
// invalid source the port produced before the collapse was added.
//
// An ESTree `SwitchCase` keeps its statements in `.consequent`, not `.body`, so upstream's
// consecutive arm never fires inside one. Ours calls that node a statement list, because it is one.
// See the note above `oneVarIsInStatementList`.
//
// ESTree wraps a method body in a `FunctionExpression`, so upstream's one listener covers methods,
// constructors and accessors. Ours has no wrapper -- a method IS `KindMethodDeclaration` -- so those
// four kinds are named explicitly as function scopes.
//
// The fifth is inert and recorded anyway: our `ClassStaticBlockDeclaration` holds a `Block` where
// upstream's `StaticBlock` is itself the statement list. See `oneVarIsBlockScope`.
//
// # `await using` is two flags, never the constant named for it
//
// `NodeFlagsAwaitUsing` is defined as `NodeFlagsConst | NodeFlagsUsing`, so a mask against it is
// true for every plain `const`. See `oneVarKindOf`, which tests both bits together instead and
// carries the measured flag table.
