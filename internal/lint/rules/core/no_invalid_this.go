// # This rule already ships under another name, and porting it anyway was a measured decision
//
// `@typescript-eslint/no-invalid-this` is registered and enabled in this tree, and upstream's
// extension is a WRAPPER: its source opens with `getESLintCoreRule('no-invalid-this')` and every
// finding comes from the core rule underneath. The standard's usual reading of that shape is that
// the core algorithm necessarily already lives inside the namespaced port, so a bare port is a
// second implementation of code already present.
//
// That reading is right about the algorithm and wrong about the VERDICTS, and the difference was
// measured rather than argued. Both installed rules -- ESLint 10.8.1's core and
// @typescript-eslint 8.67.0's extension -- were driven over all 572 cases of upstream's core corpus
// through the ESLint Linter interface. The two agree on 566 and disagree on 6, and the six are one
// class: a `this` inside the COMPUTED KEY of a class field.
//
//	class C { [this.foo]; }                          core reports, the extension is silent
//	class C { static {} [this]; }                    core reports, the extension is silent
//	function foo() { class C { accessor [this.a] = foo; } }   core reports, extension silent
//
// The cause is in the wrapper. It pushes `true` onto its validity stack for `PropertyDefinition`
// and `AccessorProperty`, which in ESTree is the whole member INCLUDING its key, so a `this` in the
// key is exempted along with one in the value. Core has no such arm and judges the key against the
// enclosing function, which is correct: a computed key is evaluated at class-definition time, where
// the instance does not exist yet.
//
// So the extension carries a false-negative class and the core rule is the one that catches it.
// That is why this port is worth having beside the namespaced one rather than being redundant with
// it, and it is the answer to the standard's "expect such a port to add no new findings" -- here it
// adds six shapes, and they are real.
//
// # This rule is ENABLED on the live tree, and `--rules-enabled` says it is not
//
// Read this before you conclude anything about whether this rule runs. It was landed deliberately
// unenabled, `CohereSettings.json` contains no `no-invalid-this` key, and it runs anyway.
//
// `settingFor` (`internal/lint/configuration/resolve.go:96`) resolves a config key by exact match,
// and failing that by trimming each configured key by the rule name and requiring what remains to
// end in `/`. The live config carries `"@typescript-eslint/no-invalid-this": "error"`. Trim that
// by this rule's name and `"@typescript-eslint/"` remains, which ends on the boundary, so the
// namespaced sibling's key resolves THIS rule too:
//
//	config key : @typescript-eslint/no-invalid-this
//	rule name  : no-invalid-this
//	remainder  : "@typescript-eslint/"   ends in "/", so it matches
//
// That suffix rule exists for a good reason and is documented at its own line: it lets one config
// entry configure a rule whichever namespace it is spelled under. The case it did not anticipate is
// an `extendsBaseRule` PAIR, where the two names are a genuine suffix of each other and are two
// different rules with two different verdicts.
//
// # The instrument disagrees with the behaviour, and the instrument is the one people read
//
// `--rules-enabled` lists literal config keys, so it reports this rule as not enabled. The resolver
// reaches it by suffix and runs it. Both are working as written and they answer differently, which
// makes the honest-reporting surface the thing that misleads.
//
// So do not settle this question with `--rules-enabled`, and do not settle it on the ahra tree
// either: ahra is clean for this rule, and a zero there cannot separate "did not run" from "ran and
// found nothing". That was tried and it could not distinguish the two.
//
// What does settle it is a probe tree with a PLANTED violation, whose config names only the
// namespaced key:
//
//	<scratch>/probetree/CohereSettings.json   { "rules": { "@typescript-eslint/no-invalid-this": "error" } }
//	<scratch>/probetree/tsconfig.json         any config including source/**/*.ts -- without one,
//	                                          cohere exits before linting and the error greps as silence
//	<scratch>/probetree/source/Seed.ts        export function seedOne() { return this.value; }
//
//	cd <scratch>/probetree && <your build> --no-fix --lint
//
// Measured: TWO findings at the identical line and column, one tagged
// `[@typescript-eslint/no-invalid-this/unexpectedThis]` and one tagged `[no-invalid-this/...]`.
// That is the standard's documented "a core rule and its extension can both be on, and both will
// fire" doubling, arriving through a spelling suffix rather than through anyone writing a second
// key.
//
// Of the registered rules absent from `--rules-enabled`, this is the ONLY one in this state.
// Checked mechanically rather than assumed: every bare-named one was tested for an enabled
// namespaced rule ending in `/<that name>`, and only this rule matched. The other unenabled rules
// have no enabled namespaced twin, so their bare names resolve to nothing and they really are off.
// That is why the usual "32 rules already ship unenabled" precedent does not cover this one.
//
// # Two decisions this rule does not make
//
// Silencing it would take an explicit `"no-invalid-this": "off"` in `CohereSettings.json`, which is
// a well-established shape there (fifteen keys are already `off`). That is Kirk's call, not a
// porter's, and turning a rule on or off through a spelling difference rather than because someone
// changed their mind is the worst way to make such a change -- it leaves no trace and reads as an
// accident nobody authored.
//
// The deeper question is whether suffix resolution should reach a bare rule at all when a
// namespaced sibling is configured. That is a design decision about the resolver rather than a
// config edit, and it is left open here on purpose. Both are recorded rather than resolved.
//
// # The same defect is present in this tree's namespaced port, and is NOT repaired here
//
// `internal/lint/rules/typescript/no_invalid_this.go` reproduces the wrapper faithfully, including
// this arm, so it is silent on all six shapes. Measured directly against it with a probe rather
// than read off its source. It is additionally silent on a seventh shape where the EXTENSION does
// report:
//
//	class C { [this.a]() {} }        core reports, the extension reports, our port is silent
//
// That one is ours alone: the port pushes `true` for `KindMethodDeclaration` before recursing, and
// `ForEachChild` visits the computed key under that push, so the key is judged under the method's
// binding. Upstream's wrapper has no method arm at all, so it never had the chance to make this
// mistake.
//
// Repairing that is a change to another author's committed and ENABLED rule, which would alter what
// the tree reports, and it is not this port's business to make. It is recorded here, with what
// established it, so the next reader finds it rather than re-deriving it.
//
// The shapes are pinned as EXECUTABLE assertions rather than as prose, in this package's own
// tests, so a later change to either rule fails loudly instead of quietly agreeing with a comment:
//
//	go test -run TestNoInvalidThisComputedKeysAreOutsideTheMember ./internal/lint/rules/core/
//
// The claim about the namespaced port was measured, not read off its source. A throwaway probe
// package ran `typescript.NoInvalidThis` over all seven shapes plus two controls that both rules
// report, and it came back silent on all seven while the controls fired. Anyone re-checking should
// rebuild that probe rather than trust this paragraph -- a comment is its author's earlier claim,
// not evidence.
//
// # Fidelity is to the module-mode verdicts, because that is the only configuration here
//
// Core's rule is built on ESLint's code path analysis and consults `scope.isStrict` on every
// function, because in sloppy mode `this` falls back to the global object and is therefore always
// valid. It also special-cases `sourceType: module` and the `globalReturn` parser feature at the
// program level.
//
// None of that survives contact with what cohere lints. Every file here is a TypeScript module, so
// every function body is strict and top-level `this` is always `undefined`. This is the hazard the
// standard names for `strict`: the corpus and this tree are being asked different questions, and
// the corpus's declared verdicts are not portable as written. Measured -- of the 474 cases in
// upstream's JavaScript matrix, 62 change verdict when the same source is re-run as a module, and
// every one of them is a sloppy-mode case where `this` was the global object.
//
// So the fixtures assert what the installed core rule answers under `sourceType: module` with the
// TypeScript parser, not what the corpus file annotates. The corpus's four conditions -- NORMAL,
// USE_STRICT, IMPLIED_STRICT and MODULES -- collapse to one configuration here, and that collapse
// was checked rather than assumed: grouping the 569 distinct (source, options) pairs by their
// source with the condition markers stripped gives 215 groups, and ZERO of those groups contain
// members that disagree. A group whose members disagreed would have meant a marker was doing real
// work and the collapse was hiding it.
//
// # The code path layer reduces to a stack of what we are inside
//
// With strictness settled, core's `onCodePathStart` / `onCodePathEnd` pair is a stack of function
// nodes, which is what the walk below maintains. Its arms are not interchangeable:
//
//	FunctionDeclaration / FunctionExpression   push the answer to the default-binding question
//	MethodDeclaration / accessors / ctor       push true, the receiver is the instance
//	PropertyDeclaration                        push true for the VALUE only, see below
//	ClassStaticBlockDeclaration                push true, `this` is the class
//	ArrowFunction                              push NOTHING, an arrow inherits the binding
//
// The arrow arm is an absence rather than a case, and it is what makes
// `function foo() { this.x; z(() => this.x); }` report twice rather than once: both `this` reads
// resolve against the same enclosing function. A port that pushed for arrows would report the outer
// one and silently exempt the inner. Fifty-one corpus cases carry that exact shape.
//
// # The computed-key discriminator is a node here, which is what makes this portable
//
// Upstream has to reason about which CHILD of the member it is in, because in ESTree the key hangs
// directly off the member node. Here a computed key is its own `KindComputedPropertyName` node
// sitting between the member and the key expression, measured with an ancestry probe over eight
// class shapes. So the walk gets an arm on that node rather than a test against the member's
// fields, and needs no knowledge of which slot the key occupies.
//
// That arm POPS the member's push for the duration of the key and restores it afterwards, rather
// than forcing a report. The difference is load-bearing and cost a draft:
// `class C { static { class D { [this.x]; } } }` is a PASSING corpus case, because popping D's
// member exposes the static block's binding underneath, which is valid. A version that reported
// whenever it found a computed property name in the ancestry reported that case.
//
// # capIsConstructor is on by default, so the zero-value struct is the wrong configuration
//
// The option surface is one boolean and its default is TRUE, which means a decoder that fills a
// zero-value struct inverts it and silently reports every `function Foo() { this.x = 1; }` in the
// tree. Forty-five corpus cases carry the option explicitly, and the decoder below is hand written
// for exactly this reason.

//
// The first question is `getJSDocComment`, which walks OUTWARD from the function to whatever node
// the documentation would sit on, and then requires the token immediately before that node to be a
// real JSDoc block. The walk is why the boundary is not a token gap, measured at ESLint 10.8.1:
//

//
// The third is the one that pins the shape: a function passed as a CALL ARGUMENT does not walk out
// at all, because upstream excludes a call or new parent before the loop starts.
//
// The second question is `getCommentsBefore`, upstream's stated fallback for callbacks, which reads
// every comment token in the gap before the function itself, block or line, and asks the same
// pattern of each. The pattern is `/^[\s*]*@this/mu`: anchored per line, allowing asterisks in the
