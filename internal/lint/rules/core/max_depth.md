## What it checks

Enforce a maximum depth that blocks can be nested

## Why this recommendation

Stylistic with a cleanup cost that is not obviously worth the convention it buys.

## Violations

176 in the tree. Showing the first few.

### What fixing looks like

Not auto-fixable. Each site needs a human decision, which is what makes the count above the real cost.
