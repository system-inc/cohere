// NoLoopFunc flags a function created in a loop that closes over a variable the loop can change.

//	valid:   for (var i=0, a=function() { i; }; i<l; i++) { }     the initializer is outside
//	invalid: for (var i=0; i<l; i++) { (function() { i; }) }
//	invalid: for (var i in {}) { (function() { i; }) }
//	invalid: for (let i=0; i<l; i++) { (function() { i; }); i = 7; }   written after the border
//
// A `var` declared in a loop is one binding for the whole loop, so a function made in the body
// closes over that binding rather than over the value at the time. Every iteration produces a
// function that will later read whatever the last iteration left behind, which is the classic
// "all my callbacks print 10" bug. `let` and `const` in the loop head are a fresh binding per
// iteration, so they are safe, and that is the repair upstream is pointing at.
//
// # What makes a reference unsafe, and it is not simply "declared with var"
//
// Upstream's `isSafe` answers in three steps, and each is reproduced:
//
//	a constant binding is safe            const, using, await using
//	a `let` declared INSIDE the loop      a different instance each iteration
//	otherwise, safe only if no write to   the border is where the outermost containing loop starts
//	that binding sits at or after a border
//
// The third is the one that carries the real judgment, and it is why
// `let a = 0; for (let i=0; i<l; i++) { (function() { a; }); }` is clean while the same code with
// `a = 1` after the loop is not. The variable is captured either way; what differs is whether
// anything can still change it.
//
// # The border, and why it is the OUTERMOST loop
//
// `getTopLoopNode` climbs from the containing loop through every enclosing loop and takes the
// outermost one's start position, stopping at the declaration when the binding is a `let`. A write
// anywhere at or after that position is unsafe, because an outer iteration can run it and then run
// the inner loop again. Taking the innermost loop instead would call
// `for (var i=0; i<l; i++) { for (var j=0; j<m; j++) { (function() { i+j; }) } }` safe in `i`, and
// upstream reports both names on it.
//
// # Where our substrate differs from upstream's, and what replaces it
//
// Upstream reads `sourceCode.getScope(node).through`, which is eslint-scope's list of references
// that escape a function unresolved by it, then `variable.references` for every reference to a
// binding, then `reference.isWrite()`. We have no resolved-reference index, so all three are
// rebuilt on the checker:
//
//	through            every identifier under the function whose resolved declaration is NOT
//	                   itself under that function. Measured to be the same set for this rule's
//	                   purposes, because a reference resolving to a declaration inside the
//	                   function is exactly what eslint-scope resolves locally and drops.
//	variable.refs      every identifier in the file resolving to the same declaration, gathered
//	                   once per file rather than per function. `no-class-assign` uses the same
//	                   inversion of the checker's one-way answer.
//	isWrite            `reference.WritesToBinding`, which is the shelf's union of the write forms
//	                   and is what `no-class-assign` and three siblings already ask.
//
// `variable.scope.variableScope === upperRef.from.variableScope` is upstream asking whether the
// write happens in the same function the variable belongs to. Reproduced by comparing the enclosing
// function-like of the declaration against that of the write, with the source file standing in for
// the outermost scope.
//
// # Immediately invoked functions, and the second half of that arm nobody expects
//
// A function called where it is made cannot outlive the iteration, so upstream skips it. The skip
// is conditional twice over: it applies only to a function that is neither `async` nor a generator,
// and a NAMED function expression whose own name is referenced from the escaping set is not
// skipped, because the name being reachable means something else can hold onto it.
//
// The skip also feeds back into the walk: a skipped function is recorded, and `getContainingLoopNode`
// then climbs THROUGH it when judging a function nested inside it. That is what makes
// `arr.push((f => f)((() => i)()));` clean, and it is why the recording is a set on the rule rather
// than a local. Our walk visits parents outward, so the same set is consulted while climbing.
//
// # What is outside the loop, and it is not the whole head
//
// A `for` statement's initializer runs once, so a function created there is not in the loop, and
// `for...in` / `for...of` evaluate their right-hand side once for the same reason. Both are corpus
// cases: `for (var i=0, a=function() { i; }; i<l; i++) { }` and
// `for (var x in xs.filter(function(x) { return x != upper; })) { }` are clean. The test and the
// update of a `for` are NOT outside; upstream returns the loop for them, and
// `for (var i=0; (function() { i; })(), i<l; i++) { }` is clean only because it is an immediately
// invoked function.
//
// # Which node kinds are judged, and why ours are seven where upstream's are three
//
// Upstream listens on FunctionDeclaration, FunctionExpression and ArrowFunctionExpression. In
// ESTree that reaches every function-like shape in the language, because an object shorthand
// method, a getter, a setter, a class method, a class constructor and a static method ALL carry a
// FunctionExpression as their `value`. Our parser gives each its own kind, so the same three
// listeners reach none of them.
//
// Measured against the installed eslint 10.8.1 build: all eleven method-like shapes report, and
// with three listeners cohere reported two. The corpus writes no method, accessor or class in any
// of its 96 cases, so nothing imported could see it. It was found by a cross-linter comparison on
// the real tree, where eslint reported three findings cohere missed, all three object shorthand
// methods inside a `for(;;)` loop capturing reassigned outer bindings.
//
// The loop-boundary climb is widened to match. Without that half, a closure written inside a method
// would climb past the method, find the loop outside it, and be judged as though it ran once per
// iteration.
//
// # A stated divergence: where the finding points on a method
//
// ESTree's FunctionExpression for `onStatement(sql) { ... }` begins at the parameter list, because
// the key belongs to the enclosing Property rather than to the function. So upstream's finding
// starts at `(sql)` and ours starts at `onStatement`.
//
// Ours is deliberate, and it is the tree's convention rather than this rule's invention.
// `require-yield` shipped before this rule, listens on `KindMethodDeclaration` and reports the
// node, and diverges from upstream on the same axis in the same direction. Measured on
// `const o = { *onStatement(sql) { return 1; } };`:
//
//	eslint require-yield   "*onStatement"                     the ESTree node it was handed
//	cohere require-yield   "*onStatement(sql) { return 1; }"  the whole method declaration
//	eslint no-loop-func    "(statementSql) { return u; }"     the FunctionExpression value
//	cohere no-loop-func    "onStatement(statementSql) { ... }" the whole method declaration
//
// The two upstream spans do not even agree with each other, because each rule reports whichever
// ESTree node its listener happened to receive, and for a method those are different nodes. Ours
// agree, because both anchor on the one node our parser gives a method.
//
// The method name is the part a reader navigates by, and a span opening on an anonymous parameter
// list tells them which line but not which member. The gate agrees this is not a parity question:
// `internal/differential/differential.go` keys a finding on file, line and rule, and its comment
// says column is excluded because the two gates locate findings at different offsets often enough
// that comparing it would drown the real disagreements. Measured on the real tree, all ten findings
// match on file and line; three differ in column by exactly the method name.
//
// Pinned by TestNoLoopFuncMethodSpanIncludesTheName so a later reader does not narrow it to match
// upstream's node boundaries without knowing this was a choice.
//
// # No fix
//
// The repair is either changing a `var` to `let`, which changes the binding's scope and is not
// always what was meant, or restructuring to pass the value in. Both are judgment, and upstream
// ships no fixer either.

// specifier's wire name.
//
// # Every arm here is EQUIVALENT for this rule, and it is kept anyway
//
// A sweep neutralising the property-access arm survived the whole corpus and survived two rounds of
// fixtures written for it, which is the signal to stop writing fixtures and go read. Measured, the
// reason is that resolution already answers the question twice over:
//
//	o.u          where `o` is undeclared, `u` gets NO SYMBOL at all
//	o.u          where `o` is typed, `u` resolves to the PropertyAssignment at its own position
//	({u: 1})     the key likewise resolves to its own PropertyAssignment
//
// In no arrangement does a property name resolve to the VariableDeclaration the rule is tracking,
// so the reference index never groups it with the variable and no verdict can move. Upstream is
// filtering because eslint-scope hands it a reference list where the distinction would matter; our
// checker has already made it.
//
// Kept because it is cheap, because it states the intent at the site where a reader looks for it,
// and because it does not rest on the checker continuing to answer this way. Not kept as a claim
// that it discriminates: it does not, and a future reader finding the mutant alive should read this
// rather than write a third fixture.

	// `let x = 1; let x = 2;` and `for (let i=0;...) { let i = 1; }`: block-scoped symbols carrying
	// more than one declaration came back 0 while the `var` control came back 5. So the arm that
