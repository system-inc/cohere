// Ported from `no-inline-comments` in ESLint, read from the clone at

//
// The whole 49-case corpus was extracted from upstream's own tester and replayed against the rule
// through the ESLint Linter API before any code was written.
//
// # The oracle disagreed with the corpus on two cases, and the corpus was right
//
// Driving this rule standalone through the Linter API reports on `var a = 1; // eslint-disable-line
// no-debugger`, which upstream's corpus lists as CLEAN. That is not a disagreement about the rule:
// ESLint's own machinery consumes directive comments before a standalone rule run sees them in the
// same way, while the rule ALSO carries its own `isDirectiveComment` guard. Both exist, and the
// guard is the half that belongs to this port.
//
// Reproducing it here means all three of those cases are expressible as fixtures rather than being
// recorded as harness limitations, which is the better outcome: `testing.Run` never consults
// `internal/lint/suppression`, so a case that depended on the suppression layer could not be pinned
// at all.
//
// # The directive test is TWO tests, and they are not the same
//
// Upstream's `isDirectiveComment` branches on comment type:
//
//	Line comment    comment.startsWith("eslint-")
//	Block comment   /^(?:eslint[- ]|(?:globals?|exported) )/
//
// So `// global foo` is NOT a directive and reports, while `/* global foo */` IS one and does not.
// Collapsing the two into one test is the obvious simplification and it changes verdicts in both
// directions. The corpus contains the block form; the line form is covered by a fixture written
// here.
//
// # What counts as "inline" is decided on the raw LINE text, not on the AST
//
// Upstream slices the comment's own start and end lines and trims what sits outside it. A comment is
// inline when either side has anything left. That is a text question rather than a syntactic one,
// which is why this rule reads the source lines directly rather than asking about enclosing nodes.
//
// # The JSX exception, and why it needs the node under the comment
//
// `<div>{/* comment */}</div>` is clean. Upstream detects it by testing whether the preamble is
// empty or exactly `{`, the postamble empty or exactly `}`, and the node at the comment's position
// is a `JSXEmptyExpression` -- an expression container holding nothing but the comment. Ours has no
// such node kind: an empty JSX expression is `KindJsxExpression` with a nil `Expression`, which is
// the same shape under a different name.
