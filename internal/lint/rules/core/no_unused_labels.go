	Description: "This label is declared and nothing jumps to it. A label only does anything " +
		"when a `break` or `continue` names it, so an unnamed one is dead syntax, and it is " +
		"usually what is left over when the jump that used it was removed or rewritten.",
}

// NoUnusedLabels flags a label no `break` or `continue` names.
//
//	valid:   A: break A;
//	valid:   A: for (var i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { if (a) continue A; }
//	valid:   outer: { function f() { inner: { break inner; } } break outer; }
//	invalid: A: var foo = 0;
//	invalid: A: for (var i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { if (a) break; }
//	invalid: A: B: 'foo'
//
// # Both jump forms count, and missing one halves the rule
//
// A label is used by a labeled `break` or a labeled `continue`, and the two are not interchangeable:
// `continue A` is legal only against a loop, `break A` against any labeled statement. A port hooking
// only `break` reports every loop whose sole jump is `continue A`, which is a false positive on
// correct code and the most common way this rule is ported wrong. Both listeners are here for that
// reason, and the clean fixture pair covers each separately.
//
// # Scope is lexical, so this needs no checker
//
// A jump reaches only the labels enclosing it, so the question is which labels contain this jump,
// and the AST already answers that. Nothing here asks what declaration a name binds to, which is the
// only question that would need type information. `A: { var A = 0; console.log(A); break A; }` is
// the case that proves the distinction: the variable `A` shadows nothing, because a label and a
// variable live in different namespaces entirely, and a rule resolving `A` as a value would find the
// variable and conclude the label was unused_exports.
//
// The walk goes upward from each jump rather than downward from each label, and stops at the first
// enclosing label whose name matches. Stopping matters: `A: { A: { break A; } }` has two labels of
// one name, the break belongs to the inner one, and marking every match would call the outer label
// used. A function or class boundary stops the walk too, since a label does not cross one.
//
// # The fix, and the three cases it refuses
//
// Removing an unused label means deleting the text from the label through the colon, leaving the
// body. That preserves meaning in most cases and is applied unattended, but not always, and this is
// the one place the port diverges from oxc.
//
// oxc declares this fix unconditionally and rewrites the labeled statement to its body every time.
// ESLint gates the same repair behind three refusals, and each one corresponds to a rewrite that
// parses and means something different. The engine's guard checks that the rewritten file parses,
// which makes it blind to exactly these: a fix producing source that parses and misbehaves is the
// one failure it structurally cannot refuse. So the refusals are ported and the divergence is
// deliberate.
//
//	comment    `A: /* comment */ foo` would discard the comment, and in `A /* comment */: foo`
//	           there is no span that removes the label and keeps it.
//	directive  `A: "use strict"` would promote the string into a directive prologue, changing which
//	           programs are legal rather than only how they read.
//	ASI        `foo()\nLABEL: [1].forEach(x => x)` would rejoin as `foo()[1]`, a different program.
//
// The finding still fires in all three. Only the repair is withheld, which is the right trade: a
// missing fix costs a manual edit, and a wrong one costs a silent behavior change.
// The verdict is about the whole file rather than about one node, since a label may be used by a
// jump written anywhere below it, so nothing can be decided at the label itself. The walk here is
// pre-order and a source-file listener fires before its children, so a listener collecting labels
// and a separate one reading them would see an empty list. Gathering and judging therefore happen in
// the same place, which is what an exit hook would otherwise buy.

// ordinary statement, and removing it can put the string somewhere a parser reads as `"use strict"`.
//
// That changes which programs are legal rather than only how they read, which is why it disqualifies
