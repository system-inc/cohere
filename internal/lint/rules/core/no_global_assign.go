// NoGlobalAssignOptions is the decoded option surface.

// The inventory column said this rule takes no options and that is wrong. oxc carries
// `NoGlobalAssignConfig { exceptions: Vec<CompactStr> }` and ESLint carries the matching
// `schema: [{ properties: { exceptions: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } } } }]`, both
// exercised by the same pass case: `Object = 0;` with `{"exceptions": ["Object"]}`.

	// Exceptions names globals that may be assigned to. A project that deliberately polyfills or

//
// Assigning to `Object`, `String`, or `Array` replaces the binding every other piece of code on the
// page reaches through. It does not fail at the line that does it: it fails later and somewhere
// else, when a library calls `Object.keys` and gets whatever was written instead, or when
// `x instanceof Array` answers about a different object. In a module or a class body the write
// throws outright, which is the better outcome, because the silent case takes the rest of the
// program down with it in a way that is very hard to trace back here.
//
// # Why this reads the checker
//
// The discrimination is name resolution and nothing structural answers it. `Object = 1` and
// `function f(Object) { Object = 1; }` are the same six characters at the write, and the first is a
// defect while the second is ordinary code shadowing a name it happens to reuse. The shadow can be a
// parameter, a `let`, a `var`, a class, a function declaration, an import, or a catch parameter,
// anywhere in an enclosing scope, so no bounded walk finds it. `no-ex-assign` gets away with name
// matching only because a catch clause hands it a subtree to stop at, and this rule's scope is the
// whole file.
//
// The predicate is which file declares the name. `Object`, `String`, `Math`, `JSON`, `Promise`,
// `NaN` and the rest are declared in the TypeScript standard library, which is a declaration file;
// anything bound in source is a shadow, whatever its kind. That is one test rather than one arm per
// shadow shape, and it is `resolvesToAGlobal`, already shipped for `no-new-native-nonconstructor`.
//
// # Upstream's corpus cannot see the bug this guards against
//
// Upstream iterates `root_unresolved_references()`, and a shadowed name *resolves*, so it never
// enters the iteration at all. The shadow filter is the choice of collection rather than a test,
// which is why upstream's eight clean cases contain zero shadowing cases: it is testing what the
// collection does not contain. A port matching on the name alone therefore passes every visible
// clean case and still reports `function f(Object) { Object = 1; }` on real code. The fixtures write
// that case and eleven more like it, because the absent test is the hazard here rather than a
// present one.
//
// # What this port does not carry, and why
//
// Upstream answers "is this a read-only global" from a vendored `javascript_globals` table selected
// by an `env` config (`browser`, `node`) and overridden by a user `globals` map. Neither table nor
// either config surface exists in this tree. Five of upstream's sixteen cases turn on nothing else,
// and three of those five share their source text with a case on the other side, separated only by
// the lint configuration:
//
//	top = 0;         clean with no env, reported under `env: {browser: true}`
//	require = 0;     clean with no env, reported under `env: {node: true}`
//	a = 1            clean under `globals: {a: true}`, reported under `globals: {a: false}`
//
// There is no information in the file that separates them, so this port reports on none of them: a
// name it cannot prove is a read-only global is left alone. That direction costs coverage rather
// than false positives, which is the right way to be short. `TestNoGlobalAssignBoundary` pins it so
// the gap stays a decision rather than becoming a drift, and the standard library covers everything
// upstream's always-on `GLOBALS_BUILTIN` table covers.
//
// # Why the checker is not sufficient on its own
//
// Symbol identity says which binding an identifier names and says nothing about whether the
// occurrence writes. `Object.x = 1;` and `foo(Object);` both resolve to the global and neither
// reassigns it, so the rule needs the structural half too and reports only where the two agree.
// `reference.WritesToBinding` is that half, shared with five sibling rules.
//
// # The one shape the checker answers differently
//
// `({Object = 0, String = 0} = {});` is upstream's two-diagnostic case, and `GetSymbolAtLocation` on
// either identifier returns the *shorthand property's own* symbol, declared in source. That reads
// exactly like a correctly declined shadow, so the plain accessor drops upstream's most interesting
// fail case in the quiet direction. Measured on the corpus rather than assumed: with
// `GetShorthandAssignmentValueSymbol` both names resolve into the standard library, and
// `function f(Object) { ({Object} = {}); }` still resolves to the parameter, so the accessor
// recovers the finding without costing the shadow test.
//
// No fix. The repair is a new binding, which means choosing a name and deciding which later uses of
// the old one meant the global.

// reaching for it is the difference between carrying upstream's two-diagnostic case and silently

//
// Delegating the file test rather than restating it keeps one answer to "is this a global" in the
