// for exactly this reason.

// Only the regex-literal cases are taken here. Upstream's corpus is roughly half `new RegExp(...)`
// calls, and this port watches the literal form only; the constructor arm is a separate surface with
// its own discrimination and porting half of it silently would be worse than declining it.

// control character at all. A rule reading the source text for `\u` would report both.
//
// The named escapes are the other half: `\t`, `\n`, `\r`, `\f`, `\v` are all control characters by
// value and none is reported, because the rule objects to spelling a code out by number rather than
// to the code point being present.
