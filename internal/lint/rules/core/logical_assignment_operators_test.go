// The corpus is ESLint's own, imported verbatim from
// /tmp/lint-sources/eslint/tests/lib/rules/logical-assignment-operators.js by driving its
// RuleTester with a stub and serialising what it was handed. No case was retyped, and a byte
// comparison against the extracted source is asserted in TestLogicalAssignmentOperatorsCorpusIsVerbatim
// below rather than trusted.
//
// Upstream runs the whole corpus at ecmaVersion 2021 with sourceType "script". The script part
// matters for the five `with` cases, which are a syntax error in a module. Our harness derives
// moduleness from the source text, and none of these fixtures carries an import or an export, so
// every one of them is script here too.
//
