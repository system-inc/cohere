// CLEAN under `sourceType: "module"` and reports under `"script"`.
//
// This tree is essentially all modules. A scan of `app`, `modules` and the structure libraries found
// 3174 files carrying a top level import or export against 2 that do not, which is why the audit
// measured zero violations. That zero is a real property of the tree rather than a blind rule, and
// the fixtures below prove the rule can fire: the harness builds a file with no import or export as
// a SCRIPT, verified with two module controls.
//
// # Three of the five messages are ported and two are declined, for a reason already settled here
//
// Upstream also reports `assignmentToReadonlyGlobal` and `redeclarationOfReadonlyGlobal`, which
// require knowing that a name is a read-only global. Both of its sources are eslint configuration
// surfaces rather than anything in the tree: the `globals` config key, and the `/*global foo:readonly*/`
// comment directive. `@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare` declined upstream's `builtinGlobals` option
// here for exactly this reason, with a probe showing a local `var Object` SHADOWS rather than merges,
// so resolution answers identically for a builtin and for an ordinary name.
//
// The decline is pinned by `TestNoImplicitGlobalsDeclinesReadonlyGlobals` rather than left as
// silence, and it costs 3 of upstream's failing cases outright plus every case carrying a directive.
//
// The `/*exported foo*/` directive is declined on the same grounds and costs 42 more cases. Of
// upstream's 245 cases, 110 are expressible here: 75 clean and 35 reporting.
//
// # The leak half asks the checker, and that is the port rather than an addition
//
// Upstream reads `scope.implicit.variables`, which is eslint-scope's record of names assigned but
// never declared. We ask resolution the same question: an assignment target that resolves to no
// symbol was never declared. Probed with a control before being built on -- `foo = 1` answers no
// symbol, `var foo; foo = 1` answers a symbol with one declaration.
//
// This half is NOT gated on the file being a script, and that is upstream's behaviour rather than an
// oversight: a leak creates a global from anywhere, including inside a function and inside a module,
// which is why `window.foo = function() { bar = 1; }` is one of upstream's failing cases.
