//
// A parameter is a local binding holding a copy of what the caller passed, so reassigning it throws
// away the argument while leaving the name in place, and every later read gets the new value while
// still reading as "the thing that was passed in". It also breaks `arguments` aliasing in sloppy
// mode, where the parameter and `arguments[0]` are the same storage. Under `props` the rule extends
// to writes THROUGH the parameter, which is a different defect: those reach the caller's object and
// mutate it, which is invisible at the call site.
//
// # Why this reaches the checker
//
// The discrimination is name resolution and almost none of it is structural. Upstream asks
// `getDeclaredVariables(functionNode)` for the parameters and then walks each one's resolved
// references, which is a find-all-references index we do not have. Four of upstream's clean cases
// write to a name spelled exactly like a parameter:
//
//	function foo(a) { (function() { var a = 12; a++; })(); }   an inner local shadows it
//	function foo() { someGlobal = 13; }                        no parameter of that name at all
//	function foo(a) { for (b in a); }                          `b` is not the parameter
//	function foo(a, z) { a.b = 0; x.y = 0; }                   `x` is not a parameter
//
// So this anchors on the parameter's own binding identifiers, which the listener already has, and
// asks the checker which declaration each candidate occurrence resolves to. A loop over the symbol's
// declarations rather than an index into it: the question is "does ANY declaration of this name's
// symbol belong to this parameter", and more declarations only mean more chances to match.
//
// # Two findings, and the second is not a write at all
//
// `bar = 13` is a write to the binding and reports as one. `bar.a = 0` is a READ of the binding whose
// surrounding expression mutates a property, so the identifier itself writes nothing and the finding
// comes from climbing outward from it. Upstream separates them the same way, and reports the property
// finding only when the reference is NOT a write, which is why `({bar} = {})` reports the binding
// finding rather than the property one.
//
// # The climb, which is upstream's algorithm rather than a simplification
//
// From the identifier, walk outward until a node that stops the search, answering along the way.
// An assignment answers true if the climb came up its left side, an update or a `delete` answers true
// outright, a `for...in` or `for...of` head answers true only if the climb came up its left. Four
// shapes answer FALSE and each is a real clean case: the arguments of a call, the computed property
// of a member access, the key of an object property, and the test of a ternary. Each is a position
// where the parameter's value is being READ to decide where some other write lands.
//
// The stop set is upstream's regular expression over node type names, which matches anything ending
// in Statement, Declaration, Function, FunctionExpression, or Program -- with `for...in` and
// `for...of` explicitly exempted so the climb can reach their heads. That set does not translate to
// node kinds directly, so it is reproduced here as a predicate over the kinds our parser produces,
// with the same three exemptions.
//
// No fix. The repair for a reassigned parameter is a new local binding, which means choosing a name
// and deciding which later reads meant the parameter; the repair for a property write is not an edit
// at all, since the point of the finding is that the mutation reaches the caller.
