	Description: "This declares a variable without a value and nothing ever assigns one, so every " +
		"read of it is `undefined`. The code below it is written as though the value arrives from " +
		"somewhere, which is what makes this hard to see in review: the comparison, the property " +
		"access, the fallback all read as ordinary until you notice nothing on the other side ever " +
		"writes. The usual cause is an assignment that was deleted, moved into a branch that no " +
		"longer runs, or never written. Give it an initializer, assign it where the value is " +
		"known, or delete the declaration.",
}

// NoUnassignedVars flags a `let` or `var` that is read but never assigned.
//
//	valid:   let x;
//	valid:   let y = undefined; log(y);
//	valid:   let one; if (one !== two) one = two;
//	valid:   declare let c: string | undefined; log(c);
//	valid:   for (let p of paths) { p.remove() }
//	invalid: let user; greet(user);
//	invalid: let flag; while (!flag) { }
//	invalid: let x: number; log(x);
//
// The variable is always `undefined`, so every read of it is a read of `undefined`, and the code
// around it is written as though a value arrives. `while (!flag)` loops forever, `config?.enabled`
// is always `undefined`, and `error || 'Unknown error'` always takes the fallback. None of those
// fail at the declaration, which is why the defect survives: the line that is wrong looks fine and
// the line that misbehaves looks fine too.
//
// A declaration nobody reads is deliberately not reported. That is `no-unused-vars`' finding, and
// duplicating it here would put two findings on every unused local in the tree. Upstream states
// this in a comment and this reproduces it.
//
// # Why this reads the checker, and why it is the conservative direction
//
// The sibling rules in this family anchor on a declaration and report a write to it. This one
// inverts the question: it reports a declaration precisely because no write to it exists. That
// flips which mistake is expensive. There, a write the rule fails to recognize is a missed finding
// on code that is already wrong. Here, a write the rule fails to recognize is a finding on code
// that is correct, accusing a variable of never being assigned three characters away from the line
// that assigns it. So the rule reports only when it can see the whole picture, and declines
// wherever it cannot.
//
// Name matching would fail in that expensive direction. `let x; function f(x) { x = 1; } log(x);`
// has a write spelled exactly like the binding, to a parameter that shadows it, and the outer `x`
// really is never assigned. But the mistake name matching makes there is the cheap one: it sees a
// same-named write and stays silent. The costly direction is the other one, and it is the reason
// for the checker:
//
//	let x; log(x); { let x; x = 1; log(x); }
//
// Two `let` bindings, one write. Name matching sees a write to "x" and declines both, missing the
// outer finding. Symbol identity separates them and reports the outer one.
//
// Node identity rather than declaration kind, which is the trap this family keeps setting. The two
// anchors above are both `let` declarations, so a comparison on kind calls the inner declaration a
// match for the outer one, concludes the outer is assigned, and reports the inner instead. That
// produces exactly one finding, same as the correct behavior, so a fixture asserting the count
// passes while the rule names the wrong variable. `TestNoUnassignedVarsNamesTheOuterBindingWhenOnlyTheInnerIsWritten`
// asserts the offset for that reason.
//
// # Why the checker is not sufficient on its own
//
// Symbol identity says which binding an identifier names; it says nothing about whether the
// occurrence writes. `x.y = 1` and `foo(x)` both resolve to the binding and neither assigns it, so a
// rule that treated every resolved occurrence as a write would go silent on most real findings.
// `reference.WritesToBinding` is the structural half, shared with the sibling rules, and the rule
// concludes "never assigned" only where no occurrence satisfies both halves.
//
// # What is exempt, and why each one
//
//	an initializer          `let x = undefined;` assigns, even to undefined
//	const and using         cannot be reassigned, so a missing value is a different mistake
//	a binding pattern       no single name to report, and `Name()` panics on one outright
//	a for-head declaration  the loop assigns on every iteration
//	an ambient declaration  `declare let c: string;` promises a value from elsewhere
//	any module declaration  reproduced from oxc, which exempts a plain `namespace` too
//
// The last one is a stated divergence from what our checker alone would give. `NodeFlagsAmbient`
// covers `declare let`, `declare module` and `declare global` in a single flag, but a plain
// `namespace N { let x: string; log(x); }` carries no ambient flag while oxc exempts it anyway: its
// guard walks ancestors for `TSNamespaceDeclaration` without asking whether `declare` is present.
// Reproduced rather than improved on, so the two implementations agree.
//
// No fix. The repair is either an initializer whose value the rule cannot know, or a deletion that
// is only correct if every read was also a mistake.
