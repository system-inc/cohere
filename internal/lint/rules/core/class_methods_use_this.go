//
// The whole 45-case corpus was extracted from upstream's own tester and replayed against the rule
// through the ESLint Linter API before any code was written.
//
// # Upstream is a stack machine and this tree has no exit hooks, so the shape had to change
//
// Upstream registers `FunctionDeclaration`, `FunctionExpression` and their `:exit` twins, pushing a
// flag on enter and popping it on exit, with `ThisExpression` and `Super` setting the top of the
// stack. There is no `rule.OnExit` here and the walk is pre-order, so that structure is not
// available.
//
// What replaces it is a single `KindSourceFile` listener that walks the file itself. The listener
// fires before its children, so the walk below is the rule's own recursion rather than the engine's,
// and enter/exit become the two sides of one recursive call. That is the shipped pattern for a rule
// that must gather before it can judge.
//
// The stack semantics are preserved exactly, and two of them are load-bearing:
//
//   - A nested function gets its OWN frame, so `foo() { function inner() { this.x; } }` does not
//     count: the inner `this` is a different `this`.
//   - An ARROW function does not, because an arrow has no `this` of its own. So
//     `foo() { return () => this.x; }` does count, and the corpus pins it.
//
// # A static block is its own frame, and that is not the same as being exempt
//
// Upstream pushes a frame for `StaticBlock` and pops it, without ever judging it. The frame is what
// matters: a static block has its own `this`, so a `this` inside one must not satisfy the enclosing
// member. Reproduced here for the same reason.
//
// # `super` counts as using `this`
//
// Upstream's `Super: markThisUsed` is easy to read past. `foo() { super.bar(); }` is CLEAN, because
// a `super` reference is only meaningful against an instance. Both a super call and a super property
// access count.
//
// # TypeScript options with no corpus coverage
//
// `ignoreOverrideMethods` and `ignoreClassesWithImplements` are typescript-eslint concepts that
// upstream's schema accepts and its JavaScript corpus never exercises: no case in the 45 sets
// either. They are implemented against the schema and the reference implementation rather than
// against fixtures, and each carries its own test written here rather than imported, because a
// TypeScript tree is exactly where they matter and upstream had no way to write one.
