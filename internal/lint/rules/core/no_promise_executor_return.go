//	invalid: new Promise((resolve, reject) => 1)
//
// The Promise constructor ignores the executor's return value, so returning one is dead at best and
// a missing `resolve` at worst.
//
// # Three questions, and the middle one is the port
//
// Is this function a promise executor: it is the FIRST argument to a `new` on an identifier spelled
// `Promise` that resolves to the global. `resolvesToAGlobal` answers the last part, probed against
// all six of upstream's shadowing cases before being built on: a `let`, a `var` declared after the
// call, a parameter, a block-scoped `const`, and a named function expression each resolve to one
// declaration outside a declaration file, while the real global resolves to five inside one.
//
// Does a `return` belong to THAT function rather than to one nested inside it. Upstream maintains a
// stack through `onCodePathStart` and `onCodePathEnd`, pushing a frame per function and recording
// whether that frame is an executor. There is no code-path event here and the walk is pre-order, so
// the same question is answered by walking UP from the return statement to its nearest enclosing
// function and asking whether that one is an executor. Same decision, and it maintains no state, so
// it cannot drift out of sync with the walk the way a stack pushed and popped by two separate events
// can. The four "does not return from the promise executor" clean cases are what pin it.
//
// `enclosingFunctionOf` in `array_callback_return_callee.go` already answers that, as upstream's own
// `getUpperFunction`, and `unwrapParentheses` in `valid_typeof.go` already peels grouping. Both were
// found by a build-time name collision after writing duplicates, and both existing ones are used
// rather than respelled: `enclosingFunctionOf` additionally stops at the source file, which is
// stricter than the version this rule would have shipped.
//
// Does the arrow have a concise body, which is a return without the keyword.
//
// # Parentheses, where our parser and upstream disagree in both directions at once
//
// Espree folds a parenthesized expression away, so upstream's `node.body` for
// `new Promise(r => (1))` IS the literal `1`. typescript-go produces a real
// `KindParenthesizedExpression`. Measured against the installed eslint at 10.8.1, that difference
// lands on two surfaces that want opposite answers:
//
//	span            reports `1`, unwrapping EVERY layer: `((1))` also reports `1`
//	wrapBraces fix  writes `{(1)}`, wrapping the OUTERMOST node, parentheses included
//	prependVoid fix writes `void (1)`, treating the existing parens as satisfying its own need
//
// So the reported node is the unwrapped expression and the brace anchors are the body node as
// written. Unwrapping is a loop rather than one step because `((1))` nests, and it is written out
// rather than reaching for `ast.SkipParentheses`, which dereferences its argument.
//
// # Suggestions, not fixes
//
// Upstream sets `hasSuggestions` and no `fixable`, and the distinction is load-bearing: both repairs
// CHANGE WHAT THE CODE MEANS. Wrapping in braces discards a value that was being returned, and
// prepending `void` discards it explicitly. Neither is a spelling change, so neither may be applied
// unattended.
//
// Which suggestions are offered is itself upstream data, and it has three answers rather than two.
// `suggestions: null` on a `return` statement without `allowVoid` means nothing is offered, because
// braces cannot help a statement that already has them. An EMPTY list appears for exactly two
// inputs, an unnamed function expression and an unnamed class expression as a concise body: upstream
// considers `wrapBraces` and declines, because `{function () {}}` is a block containing a function
// DECLARATION with no name, which is a syntax error. A named one is fine and gets the suggestion.
