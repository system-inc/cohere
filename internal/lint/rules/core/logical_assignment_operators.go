//
// # The three shapes, and why they are one rule
//
// All three spell the same thing: read a reference, and write to it only if the read came back a
// particular way. The shorthand exists because each long form evaluates the reference twice, and a
// reference evaluated twice is a reference that can answer differently the second time.
//
// # Parentheses, which upstream cannot see
//
// Upstream's selector for the second shape is
// `LogicalExpression[right.type="AssignmentExpression"]`, and its own comment says the right side
// HAS to be parenthesized or the source would not parse. Its parser folds the parentheses away, so
// the node it matches is the assignment itself. Ours keeps them: measured in the probe, the right
// side of `a || (a = b)` is a KindParenthesizedExpression wrapping the assignment. Matching without
// unwrapping first would find nothing at all, silently, on every one of upstream's 37 cases for
// that shape. This is the brief's parenthesis divergence in its costs-findings direction.
//
// # The getter judgment, which decides fix against suggestion
//
// The repair is applied unattended only when collapsing two reads into one cannot change what runs.
// A bare identifier is safe. A member access is not, because `a.b` may be a getter and the
// shorthand reads it once where the long form read it twice, so upstream offers those as
// suggestions instead. That split is not cosmetic here either: `ReportNodeWithFixes` is applied by
// the edit engine with nobody watching, and `ReportNodeWithSuggestions` is not.
//
// The one place a member access IS fixed is the second shape, where upstream additionally accepts
// an access whose object is an identifier, `this` or `super` and whose key is not itself an access.
// `a.b || (a.b = c)` is fixed; `a.b.c || (a.b.c = d)` is only suggested.
//
// # What `with` does to that judgment
//
// Inside a non-strict `with` block an identifier is not necessarily a variable: it may resolve to a
// property of the scrutinee, which may be a getter. So upstream's `cannotBeGetter` returns false
// for an identifier inside a `with`, and the safe and unsafe cases invert. Our parser accepts
// `with` in a TypeScript file and produces a KindWithStatement with no parse diagnostic, measured
// in the probe, so the corpus's five `with` cases are reproducible rather than unrepresentable.
//
// Strictness is what turns the guard off, because `with` is illegal in strict code. Upstream asks
// its scope analysis; here the question is whether the file is a module or carries a "use strict"
// prologue, which is what logicalAssignmentIsStrict answers.
//
// # Silent inside React Compiler's functions, where ESLint is not
//
// React Compiler refuses all three shorthands, `Handle ||= operators in AssignmentExpression` on
// babel-plugin-react-compiler 1.0.0, in a hook body and inside an effect callback alike, while the
// same rewrite in a plain helper compiles. So under `always` the rule says nothing inside a function
// the compiler compiles, decided by the react shelf's `IsInsideComponentOrHook`, the predicate the
// react rules already share rather than a second component detector. ESLint reports there; those
// are its false positives, and three ahra sites carried them (UsersRolesPage.tsx:121,
// RestEndpointNodeContent.tsx:335, WebSocketViaSharedWorkerProviderInternal.tsx:309).
//
// cohere's configuration does not say whether the compiler is on, since it lives in a Next config as
// a JavaScript value, so the rule takes it as its own `reactCompiler` option, on by default. Every
// tree we lint runs the compiler, and the fixer applies `||=` to a bare identifier unattended, so
// the default is the side where an unattended rewrite cannot cost a component its compilation.
