// Radix flags a call to `parseInt` with no radix, or with one that is not a base it accepts.
//
//	valid:   parseInt("10", 10);
//	valid:   parseInt("10", foo);
//	valid:   var parseInt; parseInt();
//	invalid: parseInt("10");
//	invalid: parseInt("10", 1);
//	invalid: parseInt();
//
// # Three judgments over one call, and they are ordered
//
// No arguments is `missingParameters`, one argument is `missingRadix`, and two or more with a bad
// second is `invalidRadix`. They are exclusive, so a call reports at most once, and upstream's
// corpus states that: no case here carries two findings for one call.
//
// # A valid radix is an integer literal from 2 to 36, and everything else is a question
//
// The rule is deliberately narrow about what it will call invalid. A literal that is not an integer
// in range reports, and so does a bare `undefined`. Anything the rule cannot evaluate is accepted:
// `parseInt("10", foo)` and `parseInt("10", +radix)` and `parseInt("10", ~1)` are all clean, because
// a rule that guessed at them would report correct code. The one arithmetic form it does evaluate is
// a leading `+` or `-` on a numeric literal, which is why `+37` reports and `+10` does not.
//
// Our parser keeps a numeric literal's canonical text, so `0x10`, `1.6e1` and `10.0` all read as 16,
// 16 and 10 without a numeric parser being written here. All three are upstream passing cases.
//
// # A spread before the radix abandons the call
//
// `parseInt(...args)` could be any number of arguments, so nothing can be said about where the radix
// is, and upstream declines. A spread AFTER the first two positions does not hide anything, which is
// why `parseInt("10", 1, ...args)` still reports an invalid radix. The index test is upstream's and
// the boundary is exact.
//
// # Shadowing, and where this port is more precise than upstream
//
// A local `parseInt` is not the global one, so the rule has nothing to say about it. Upstream asks
// eslint-scope for the PROGRAM scope's variable and checks whether anything defines it, which makes
// its answer whole-file: measured against the installed rule, `{ let parseInt; } parseInt("10");`
// is CLEAN upstream even though the block-scoped binding cannot reach the call.
//
// This port resolves each call site instead, through `resolvesToAGlobal`, so that input reports
// here. The divergence is deliberate and it is in the direction of reporting a real defect that
// upstream misses, rather than of reporting correct code. It is pinned by a fixture that states
// both answers.
//
// The mechanism was probed before being built on: `parseInt` at a plain call site resolves to a
// declaration in the standard library, and every shadow form -- a `var`, a parameter, a `let` --
// resolves to a declaration in source. A type-only `interface parseInt {}` resolves to the library,
// which is right, since a type does not shadow a value.
//
// # Suggestions rather than fixes, and the trailing comma is why
//
// Upstream offers a suggestion rather than a fix, so a human chooses it. Adding a radix changes what
// the call returns for any string the reader was relying on being inferred, which is a meaning
// change rather than a spelling one, and that is exactly the line between the two.
//
// The insertion goes before the closing parenthesis and has to read what precedes it: with a
// trailing comma already there, upstream writes `" 10,"` rather than `", 10"`, turning
// `parseInt("10",)` into `parseInt("10", 10,)`. Both spellings are in the corpus.
//
// # The option is deprecated and does nothing
//
// `meta.schema` still accepts `"always"` or `"as-needed"`, and the rule body never reads
// `context.options`. Upstream's corpus proves it: `parseInt("10", 8)` appears as a passing case
// under BOTH values, and so does `parseInt("10", foo)`. So no decoder is registered here, which
// makes an option in the config an error rather than a silent no-op.
