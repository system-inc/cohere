// # What this rule decides, and at what scope
//
// The question here is deliberately narrow: is this binding read anywhere within the file that
// declares it. That is not the same question as "is this symbol used anywhere in the program", and
// the difference is the whole reason this rule can be a per-file gate at all.
//
// A per-file rule cannot see who imports the file it is handed, so every exported binding is
// treated as used. That is upstream's answer too, for the same reason, and it is the conservative
// direction: the alternative is reporting a component's only export as dead because this file
// happens not to call it. The program-wide claim is a real and different analysis and it already
// exists here as `cohere --unused`, which is opt-in precisely so that reading every file in the
// program does not poison the per-file findings cache. See `rule.ProgramReads` for why that
// separation is structural rather than stylistic: a rule reading beyond its own file, cached on
// that file's hash, serves a stale answer forever and nothing notices.
//
// So this rule declines the whole-program question rather than approximating it. Two analyses, two
// scopes, neither pretending to be the other.
//
// # Why this does not use the liveness dataflow, and what that costs
//
// `no_useless_assignment_analysis.go` in this package is a real backward-liveness dataflow over the
// control-flow graph, and the temptation to route this rule through it is strong: oxc spends
// roughly 990 lines in `usage.rs` hand-matching patterns — a self-reference inside a function's own
// body, a variable only ever reassigned to itself, a write nothing reads — that a dataflow answers
// in one query. oxc has an SSA crate in the same repository and this rule does not touch it, which
// reads like an omission.
//
// It is not an omission this port should correct, and the reason is the harness rather than the
// analysis. The differential compares our findings against oxlint's. A rule that is *more* correct
// than upstream produces a difference, and a difference costs the harness its meaning whether the
// extra finding is right or wrong. Measured on upstream's own corpus, the two approaches genuinely
// disagree: `test_vars_self_use` ships `chain = chain.extend()` inside a `for` loop as a PASS and
// the same statement outside a loop as a FAIL. A liveness pass sees a store whose value no later
// read observes in both cases and would report both. Upstream's answer is the loop-shape test at
// `usage.rs:612` (`is_in_for_loop_test_or_update`) and `:634` (`is_in_loop_body`), which is a
// syntactic proxy for the flow fact that a loop's back edge makes the store observable on the next
// iteration.
//
// The dataflow would get that particular case right and would still be a divergence, because it
// would also change the answer on shapes upstream never wrote a case for and where nobody has
// established which answer is correct. So the pattern catalogue is reproduced, upstream's loop
// exemptions included, and the flow analysis is left where it already ships a measured win.
//
// The cost is stated rather than hidden: this rule is exactly as blind as upstream is, on exactly
// the shapes upstream is blind on. That is the subset this port can show correct.
//
// # What this reports against upstream, measured
//
// 407 of 407 clean cases stay clean, 301 of 303 reporting cases report, and all 51 JSX cases agree.
// oxc's corpus ships two more clean cases that are clean only under its leading-underscore default;
// ESLint reports both, and so does this rule now (see the next section).
// The two that do not are named with their causes in `noUnusedVarsKnownGaps`, and one of them is a
// case upstream cannot report either and documents as such in its own test file.
//
// Zero false positives is the property that matters most here and it is the one held fixed: every
// change that closed a gap was measured against all the clean cases first, and two changes that
// closed gaps at the cost of a clean case were reworked rather than kept. A rule that misses
// something costs a finding nobody had; a rule that accuses wrongly costs trust in every finding it
// makes.
//
// # No name is ignored by default, which is ESLint's answer and no longer oxc's
//
// oxc ignores any binding whose name begins with `_` under default options; ESLint does not. This
// is measured on both: ESLint's own Linter API reports `_a` in `const _a = 1;` with no options
// configured, and oxc's `ignored.rs:455` resolves `IgnorePattern::Default` to
// `haystack.starts_with('_')`.
//
// This rule took oxc's answer while oxc was what the differential compared against, and reversed it
// on 2026-10-01 under the parity doctrine: never worse than ESLint, rule by rule. Measured on the
// installed `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` 8.67.0 with no options, `const _deliberate = 1`,
// `const _ = 1`, `function f(_) {}` and `catch (_) {}` all report, so oxc's default was a set of
// findings ESLint makes and this rule did not. It was also an allowance built into the rule rather
// than written in a config: the ahra config carried `varsIgnorePattern`, `argsIgnorePattern` and
// `caughtErrorsIgnorePattern` at `^$` for no reason but to switch it off, and those three lines are
// now redundant. An exemption a project wants is still available by configuring a pattern, where it
// is visible.
//
// History worth keeping, because it explains the `^$` lines a reader will still find in configs: on
// 2026-09-05 the one finding ESLint made on ahra and this rule did not was `_nextContent` at
// `modules/pensieve/PensieveBootstrap.test.ts`, missing only because of the oxc default, and the
// `^$` patterns were added to close it.
//
// The message offers the underscore escape only when the resolved config honours it, which is to
// say only when `_` plus the name matches the pattern configured for that kind of binding. Before,
// it told every finding to prefix an underscore, including `_nextContent` under a `^$` config.
//
// Worth stating plainly because it has been assumed twice in the other direction: the missing
// finding is NOT evidence that this rule is blind to type declarations. It is not. A seeded probe
// carrying an unused `type` alias, an unused `interface` and an unused `const` reports all three,
// and the two type findings above are ones this rule already makes on the real tree. The
// `bindingType` arm in `collectCandidateBindings` is what does it. A port of the namespaced rule
// undertaken to recover type-declaration coverage would be recovering coverage that is already
// here.
