// noRestrictedImportsGlob is one compiled gitignore-style pattern from a `group` entry.
//
// This exists because upstream's `no-restricted-imports` matches a module specifier with the
// `ignore` npm package -- literally `ignore({allowRelativePaths: true, ignorecase: !caseSensitive})
// .add(group).ignores(importSource)` -- and there is no such matcher anywhere in this tree.
// `filepath.Match`, which `react/no-danger` uses in place of minimatch, is not a substitute: it has
// no negation, no `**`, and a bare `foo` under it does not match `import1/private/foo`, which is the
// single most common shape in upstream's corpus.
//
// # This is gitignore's grammar, not a glob's, and the differences all decide real cases
//
// Every rule below was measured against the installed `ignore` package over 864 (pattern, specifier)
// pairs built from upstream's own corpus, not read off its documentation. The table lives in
// `no_restricted_imports_matcher_test.go`.
//
//	foo             matches `foo`, `foo/bar` and `import1/private/foo`   -- a bare name is
//	                anchored at any segment boundary, in either direction
//	foo/bar         matches `foo/bar` only                               -- a pattern containing a
//	                slash anchors at the start
//	foo/*           matches `foo/bar`, not `foo/a/b`                     -- `*` stops at `/`
//	**              matches everything
//	**/my/relative-module   matches `../../my/relative-module`
//	!foo/bar        un-matches, and LAST match wins
//	\#foo           matches `#foo/bar`; an unescaped leading `#` would be a comment
//	FOO             matches `foo` unless caseSensitive is set
//
// The negation rule is the one that cannot be approximated. `["foo/*", "!foo/bar"]` matches
// `foo/baz` and not `foo/bar`, and reversing the entries changes the answer, so the patterns have to
// be evaluated in order with the last decision winning rather than as a set of alternatives.
