//
// A loop whose condition can never change its answer is a loop that runs forever or not at all. The
// variable being written somewhere else in the file is what makes this reportable rather than
// obvious: the author clearly expected it to change, and the write is outside the loop.
//
// # Groups, and why `foo < bar` is one judgment rather than two
//
// A reference inside a BinaryExpression belongs to that expression as a group, and a group is only
// reported when EVERY member of it is unmodified. `while (foo < bar) { foo += 1; }` is clean in both
// names, because changing either one can change the comparison. When neither changes, both names are
// reported, which is why that case carries two findings rather than one.
//
// A ConditionalExpression is a group too, so `while (foo ? bar : baz) { foo += 1; }` is clean.
//
// # Dynamic expressions abandon the group entirely
//
// If the group holds a call, a member access, a `new`, a tagged template, or a `yield`, the whole
// search stops and nothing is reported, because any of those can have an effect the rule cannot
// see. That is why `while (foo === f(bar)) { }` and `while (foo === obj.bar) { }` are clean: a
// getter or a function call may be changing the world. The check does not descend into a nested
// function, since a function that is merely written is not called.
//
// # A modification counts when it can run in the loop, and that includes a called function
//
// A write inside the loop marks the condition modified. So does a write inside a named function
// DECLARATION, when that function is itself referenced from inside the loop. This is the pair the
// corpus states twice, once each way:
//
//	while (foo) { update(); } function update() { ++foo; }         clean, update is called here
//	while (foo) { update(); } function update(foo) { ++foo; }      reported, that is a parameter
//
// The second differs only in that `foo` is shadowed by a parameter, so the write is to a different
// binding entirely and never reaches the loop's variable.
//
// # The initializer is not a modification, except for `var`
//
// `isWriteReference` declines a reference marked as an initializer unless the binding is a `var`.
// `for (var foo = 0; foo < 10; ) { } foo = 1;` reports on that basis: the `foo = 0` in the head is
// an initializer on a `var`, so it counts as a write, yet it sits in the loop's own initializer,
// which is excluded from "in the loop" for a ForStatement. The write that would save it is outside.
//
// # Where the loop condition is, and the initializer that is not part of it
//
// Only `while`, `do`/`while` and `for` have a test. A `for...in` or `for...of` has no condition at
// all and is never judged. For a `for`, a reference inside the INITIALIZER is not "in the loop",
// which is what makes `var foo = 0, bar = 0; for (bar; foo;) { ++foo }` clean while the same shape
// with the write in the initializer is not.
//
// # This ports the INSTALLED build, and the clone has an option it does not
//
// The clone at 10.9.1 adds `checkConditionalExpressions`, which turns a ConditionalExpression from
// a group into three separate judgments. The installed eslint 10.8.1 build this repository runs has
// `schema: []` and no such option: configuring it throws at config validation with "should NOT have
// more than 0 items", measured by driving it through the linter interface.
//
// So this rule takes no options, matching what our gate compares against, and the three corpus cases
// carrying that option are recorded in the fixtures as unmeasurable against the oracle rather than
// asserted either way. When the installed build moves to 10.9, the option is the follow-up.
//
// # No fix
//
// The repair is either updating the variable in the body or rewriting the condition, and which one
// is wanted is the whole question the finding asks. Upstream ships no fixer either.

// Adding `&& current.Name() != nil` to the stop, so the climb skips an unnamed declaration and
// keeps going outward, also survives. That is correct rather than a fixture gap: to distinguish the
// two spellings you need an UNNAMED function declaration NESTED inside a named one, and the only
// unnamed declaration the grammar has is `export default function`, which may not appear inside a
// function body.
//
// Measured, and this is the one place it is not simply absent: the TypeScript parser accepts
// `function d() { export default function () { ++foo; } }` through error recovery, and the
// installed eslint 10.8.1 build reports on it, which agrees with the stop written here. No fixture
// asserts it, because pinning a rule's behaviour on a syntax error records a fact about error
// recovery rather than about the rule. The distinguishing input is named here instead, so the next
// reader finding this mutant alive has it rather than having to re-derive it.
