// `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/eslint/prefer_const.rs` carries FIVE Tester blocks, which the
// extractor reports and which reading only the last one would silently drop four of:
//
//	block 1   75 pass, 65 fail   test_and_snapshot
//	block 2    3 pass,  0 fail   test, NOT snapshotted   svelte files
//	block 3    2 pass,  0 fail   test, NOT snapshotted   vue files
//	block 4    0 pass,  1 fail   test, NOT snapshotted   astro file
//	block 5   13 pass, 11 fail   test_and_snapshot
//
// 93 pass and 77 fail in total, against 98 snapshot diagnostics: several inputs report more than
// once, so a fixture asserting one finding per input would be wrong and the counts below are
// stated per case.
//
// Blocks 2, 3 and 4 are framework single-file-component sources. Upstream skips `.svelte` and
// `.vue` entirely in `should_run`, because oxlint parses only their `<script>` block and a binding
// the template reassigns therefore looks never-reassigned. Our engine is fed TypeScript files and
// never sees those extensions, so those five cases are not portable and are recorded here rather
// than transcribed into fixtures that would assert nothing. Block 4's astro case is upstream's own
// known-wrong entry: it fails on a file oxlint cannot parse as JavaScript.

// TestPreferConstFires covers the inputs upstream reports on, with the snapshot's own count.

// project asking for "all" would silently get the other judgment with nothing reported anywhere.
// This asserts the decode directly so that a revert fails here rather than in a user's tree.
