// (`templateFunction`) is there because a tag makes no difference: it is still a template and still

// `'$}'` closes without opening. `'{foo}'` has braces without a dollar. Those four are why the

// measured rather than assumed: our parser hands back that raw and that cooked pair, and the

// upstream matches `node.value`, which is already cooked. A port scanning `TokenRange` text instead
// would be silent here, and silent on exactly the string that renders with a live-looking
// placeholder in it.
//
// The second case is the same dollar written as a unicode escape, which no reading of the raw text
// could find at all. It reports upstream; measured.
//
// The reverse direction has no expressible case in our tree, and that is worth stating rather than
// leaving as an absence: a raw `${` that cooks away would need an escape that erases characters,
// and the only one is a line continuation, which cannot sit between the dollar and the brace and

// is a character. That single space is the entire difference between the two, and a port writing
// `[^}]*` would report both while passing every imported fixture, since the corpus contains
// neither.
//
// `'${{a}}'` reports: the class is negated on the brace rather than lazy, so the match is `${{a}`
// and the trailing brace is left over. `'$ {a}'` is clean because the opening must be adjacent.
//
// The last two are the backtracking cases. An opening that fails to close does not end the search,
