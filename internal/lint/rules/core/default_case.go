		"through silently and the statement does nothing. That is occasionally what the author " +
		"meant and is far more often an unhandled case that was added to the type later and never " +
		"added here. The two readings are indistinguishable from the code, which is the problem: a " +
		"reader cannot tell a deliberate omission from a forgotten branch. Add a `default`, even " +
		"one that throws, or write a `// no default` comment after the last case to say the " +
		"omission is intended.",

// DefaultCase requires a `switch` statement to carry a `default` case.
//
//	valid:   switch (a) { case 1: break; default: break; }
//	valid:   switch (a) { case 1: break; // no default
//	         }
//	valid:   switch (a) { }
//	invalid: switch (a) { case 1: break; }
//	invalid: switch (a) { case 1: break; // no default here

//
// Ported from `default-case` in ESLint, read from the clone at `lib/rules/default-case.js`. One
// option (`commentPattern`), one message, no fixer: `meta` carries `type`, `defaultOptions`, `docs`,
// `schema` and `messages`, and the string `fixable` does not appear in the file.
//
// The whole 23-case corpus was extracted from upstream's own tester and replayed against the
// installed ESLint through the Linter API before any code was written.
//
// # An empty switch is skipped, and the reason is upstream's rather than ours
//
// `switch (a) {}` is clean, and upstream says why in a comment at the line: there is "no easy way to
// extract comments inside it now". That is a limitation of what ESLint's source code object can
// answer, not a judgment that an empty switch is fine. We could answer it here -- the comment
// scanner has no such restriction -- but reproducing the DECISION means reproducing the silence,
// because a port that reports on empty switches disagrees with the corpus and with every project
// currently relying on the rule. Recorded rather than silently improved.
//
// # Where the excusing comment has to be, and why the answer is not "inside the switch"
//
// Upstream reads `sourceCode.getCommentsAfter(lastCase)` and takes the LAST of them. So the comment
// must follow the final case clause, and when several comments follow it only the last one is
// consulted:
//
//	switch (a) { case 1: break; /* fallthrough */ // no default
//	}                                             <- excused, the last comment matches
//	switch (a) { case 1: break; // no default
//	             /* something else */ }           <- reports, the last comment does not match
//
// Both shapes are in the corpus. Anchoring on "any comment inside the switch" passes most of it and
// fails those two, which is why the position is computed rather than approximated.
//
// # Comments are read from the shelf rather than rescanned
//
// `comments.ForFile` computes the file's comment list once and shares it with every rule that asks.
// A rule scanning the file itself is invisible to that cache and pays the whole cost alone; the
// shelf's own doc comment records three rules that each rescanned the file through one well-factored
// helper before it existed.
