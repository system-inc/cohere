		"ordinary space while the parser sees something else. That is how a no-break space " +

// irregularWhitespaceCodepoints is the set this rule reports, transcribed from upstream rather than
// composed out of a scanner predicate.
//
// The distinction is the whole trap. A scanner's whitespace predicate answers "may the parser skip
// this", which is a different question with a different answer at both ends. stringutil's
// IsWhiteSpaceLike is the near-match in this tree and it is wrong in both directions: it adds tab,
// newline, carriage return, and space, so a rule built on it reports every line of every file, and
// it omits U+180E, which is Unicode category Cf rather than Zs. A spec-correct scanner must exclude
// U+180E for that reason, and this rule must include it for that same reason, because a format
// character sitting between two tokens is as invisible and as confusing as a wide space is.
//
// oxc reaches the same set by a different route, ORing its parser predicate with its line-terminator
// predicate and then bolting U+180E on by hand with a comment saying why. Both sides land on the
// same 24 codepoints. They are written as numbers rather than as character literals because the
// characters are invisible: a literal here would be unreadable, unreviewable in a diff, and would
// trip this very rule.

// NoIrregularWhitespaceOptions is the five switches, each excusing one region of the file.
//
// Every field is a pointer because every default here is a real decision rather than a zero value,
// and one of them defaults to something Go's zero value is not. A plain bool cannot tell "the config
// said false" from "the config said nothing", and for SkipStrings those mean opposite things.
//
// The defaults applied below are ESLint's, which is also what this tree's resolved config asks for
// on every file. oxc's differ on three of the five: it ships skipRegExps, skipTemplates, and
// skipJSXText as true, so an unconfigured oxlint is quieter than an unconfigured ESLint on regexes,
// templates, and JSX text. Following ESLint is not a preference here, it is the configuration this
// tree actually runs. The imported fixtures pass oxc's values explicitly, so upstream's counts still
// reproduce exactly rather than being quietly reinterpreted.

	SkipRegExps   *bool

	// SkipJSXText carries a json tag because the option is spelled skipJSXText rather than
	// skipJsxText. Go's decoder matches field names case-insensitively so this happens to resolve
	// without the tag, but the upstream Rust needs an explicit rename for the same reason, and a
	// reader comparing the two should not have to discover that our decoder is the lenient one.

//
//	valid:   const indent = String.fromCharCode(0x00a0);
//	valid:   const text = 'a b';
//	invalid: const value = 1;
//	invalid: // a comment holding a wide space
//
// The characters are invisible, so the defect they cause never looks like the character. A no-break
// space between `const` and a name is a syntax error on a line that reads as correct, and a zero
// width space inside an identifier makes two identical-looking names into different bindings. This
// tree already works around the rule rather than fighting it: a sidebar component builds an indent
// string with String.fromCharCode(0x00a0) and says in a comment that embedding the character
// directly trips this lint.
//
// # Why this scans text rather than nodes
//
// oxlint gets the code positions for free. Its lexer records every irregular-whitespace span it
// skips into a trivia builder, so its rule reads a list the parser already built. typescript-go's
// scanner exposes no equivalent, and probing for one found nothing, so the positions have to be
// recovered here. This scans the source text for the whole set and then subtracts the regions an
// option excused, which structurally resembles ESLint's subtractive design rather than oxc's
// additive one even though oxc is the port target. That inversion is the port, and it is stated
// because a reader comparing this file to the Rust will otherwise hunt for a lexer hook that does
// not exist on this side.
//
// # Granularity
//
// One finding per character, matching oxc. ESLint's regex carries a `+` quantifier and reports a run
// of adjacent irregular characters as a single finding, so on two adjacent vertical tabs ESLint says
// one thing and oxc says two. oxc's snapshot holds 83 diagnostics across 58 inputs and that gap is
// mostly this. Per character is the more useful of the two: each one is a separate character to
// delete, and a span covering a whole run tells a reader less about what to remove.
//
// # The byte order mark
//
// A U+FEFF at offset zero is a byte order mark rather than a stray character, and is not reported.
// Anywhere else in the file it is reported like any other member of the set. oxc carries this
// carve-out and ESLint does not, and oxc's corpus pins it with a passing case.
//
// No fix. The right repair is usually an ordinary space, but not always: a zero width space inside a
// string is sometimes deliberate, a byte order mark mid-file is an encoding accident rather than a
// typo, and deleting versus replacing changes the token stream differently. An unattended rewrite
// that picks wrong here edits characters nobody can see, which is the worst place to be wrong.
