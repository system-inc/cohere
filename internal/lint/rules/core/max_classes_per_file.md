## Where cohere differs from ESLint

A class declared inside a function, a method's body included, does not count. ESLint counts every class in the file. Kirk ruled it on #mbbg6js: one class per file names the design unit a reader greps for, and a class declared inside a test's `describe` or `it` is a fixture, not a unit. A class in a namespace still counts. Class expressions are left out through upstream's own `ignoreExpressions`, which ahra and the ESLint configuration both set. The three nexus type tests where ESLint still reports are recorded in `internal/differential/acknowledged.go`.

## What it checks

Enforce a maximum number of classes per file

## Why this recommendation

Stylistic. Small enough to adopt if we want the convention, not urgent if we do not.

## Violations

18 in the tree. Showing the first few.

### What fixing looks like

Not auto-fixable. Each site needs a human decision, which is what makes the count above the real cost.
