// unicodeBomMark is the byte order mark as it appears in a UTF-8 source file.
//
// Three bytes, `ef bb bf`, rather than the single code point `U+FEFF` an ESLint rule reasons about.
// This is the whole difference between the two ports: ESLint reads its source as a JavaScript
// string with the mark already stripped into a `hasBOM` flag, so its fixer can write the sentinel
// range `[-1, 0)` and let the fix applier interpret it. cohere's source text is the file's bytes,
// measured: `SourceFile.Text()` on a marked file begins `ef bb bf` and the source file NODE's own
// range starts after them, at position 3. So the mark is ordinary text here and the repair is an
// ordinary edit over `[0, 3)`.
const unicodeBomMark = "\ufeff"

// UnicodeBomSetting is which of the two things this rule enforces.
//
// A string rather than a bool because upstream's option is a string enum and the two spellings are
// what a config author writes. Keeping the name means a misconfiguration reads as a misconfiguration
// rather than as a silently-false flag.

	// UnicodeBomNever forbids it, which is upstream's default.
	UnicodeBomNever UnicodeBomSetting = "never"
)

// UnicodeBomOptions carries upstream's single positional option.
//
// The pointer is the point. Upstream's `defaultOptions: ["never"]` means an ABSENT option forbids
// the mark, so the zero value of a plain `UnicodeBomSetting` field is the empty string, which
// matches neither arm and makes the rule silent on every file it is meant to catch. A rule
// configured as bare `"error"` in the live config is exactly that case, and it is the common one.
// Keeping the wire value nullable is what lets `DefaultUnicodeBomSettings` fill it in rather than
// having an inversion decided by Go's zero value.

// DecodeUnicodeBomOptions turns the configured value into options.
//
// Hand-rolled rather than `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` for two reasons that both matter here and only
// the first is the usual one.
//
// The generic helper errors on empty input, the config layer turns that error into nil for a rule
// whose options are not required, and the rule then reads nil as a zero value. For an option
// defaulting to FALSE that is harmless; for this one it is an inversion, because the default is
// `never` and the zero value is the empty string, which reports nothing at all.
//
// The second reason is the wire shape. Upstream's option is a bare STRING at the top of its schema
// array, so a config writes `["error", "always"]` and cohere's config layer strips the tuple before
// dispatch: what arrives here is the JSON `"always"`, not `["always"]` and not `{"require":...}`.
// A decoder built by naming a struct field could not read that at all.
//
// An unrecognised string is an error rather than a silent fallback to the default. A config saying
// `"alway"` is a mistake somebody made, and turning it into `never` would enforce the opposite of
// what they wrote with nothing anywhere saying so.

//	invalid (always): var a = 123;
//	invalid (never):  <mark> var a = 123;
//
// # The default is `never` and getting that wrong makes the rule silent rather than loud
//
// Upstream declares `defaultOptions: ["never"]`, so a rule configured as a bare severity forbids the
// mark. Measured against the installed build at 10.8.1: `unicode-bom: "error"` on a marked file
// reports `unexpected`, identically to the explicit `["error", "never"]`. That is the case the live
// config produces and the case a zero-valued options struct would get wrong, which is why the
// decoder above is hand-rolled and why a fixture routes nil through it.
//
// # Where the finding points
//
// Upstream reports with an explicit `loc: {line: 1, column: 0}` and no end, which is line 1 column
// 1 in the one-based numbering a reader sees, and it does that for BOTH arms including the one where
// the mark is absent. Reporting the source file NODE would be wrong in a way no message-id fixture
// could see: the node's range begins AFTER the mark, measured at position 3 for a marked `var a = 1;`,
// so a marked file would report at the first real token rather than at the mark being complained
// about. The empty range at position zero is used instead, which is where upstream points and the
// only span that is inside the mark rather than after it.
//
// # The repair, and why one pass removes one mark
//
// Both arms are fixable and upstream declares `fixable: "whitespace"`. Adding the mark is an insert
// at position zero; removing it is a delete of the three bytes there.
//
// A file beginning with the mark TWICE reports once and this rule's single fix removes one of them,
// leaving a file that still begins with a mark. That is not a defect and it matches upstream:
// measured, `linter.cohere` on a doubled mark returns exactly one message carrying one fix, and it
// is `cohereAndFix`'s re-lint loop, not the rule, that strips the second on a later pass. A port
// removing both in one edit would be doing something upstream's rule never does.
//
// # This rule is registered and NOT enabled, because it cannot see its subject here
//
// Everything above is a faithful port and every fixture below it passes, and the rule still reports
// nothing on a real file no matter what that file contains. The reason is one layer down and it is
// measured rather than argued.
//
// Every source file in a real run is read through `osvfs.FS().ReadFile`, and that read STRIPS a
// leading byte order mark. Probed directly: a file whose first bytes on disk are `ef bb bf` arrives
// as text beginning `65 78 70`, three bytes shorter, while an unmarked control of the same length
// comes back unchanged and a mark written in the MIDDLE of a file survives. The removal is specific
// to position zero, which is the only position this rule asks about. `cachedvfs` wrapping the same
// reads answers identically, so it is not the caching layer.
//
// The fixtures do not see this because `rule_testing.Run` parses a Go string and never touches the
// filesystem, so `SourceFile.Text()` there holds whatever the fixture wrote, mark included. That is
// the gap between a green suite and a working rule, and it is why the seeded probe tree matters: a
// two-file tree holding one genuinely marked file was offered to this rule, registered a listener,
// and reported zero.
//
// So the rule stays registered and out of the config, with the reason recorded in
// `deliberatelyNotEnabled`. What would make it work is small and belongs elsewhere: a lint phase
// reading the file's real bytes, or a flag on the source file saying a mark was stripped. Worth
// knowing while that is decided: the FIX phase reads through `os.ReadFile` and KEEPS the mark, so
// on a marked file the two phases disagree by three bytes about where every offset in that file
// lives. That is a hazard for any fixable rule, not only this one.
//
// # Only the first position counts
//
// A mark written at the END of a file is clean under `never`, which is upstream's own third valid case. A mark
// anywhere but position zero is an ordinary zero-width no-break space character, so the test is a
// prefix test rather than a search.
