//
// Writing them on both sides is legal and redundant, writing them on neither leaves the checker to
// infer, and the rule is about picking one so a codebase reads the same way throughout. It has no
// opinion about which, which is why the mode is an option and the default is upstream's.
//
// # Four anchors, and one of them is not a declaration
//
// Upstream's selector matches a variable declarator, a property definition, an accessor property,
// and a DEFAULT PARAMETER of a function declaration or function expression. That last one is easy to
// miss and the corpus tests it in both modes: `function foo(a: Foo<string> = new Foo()) {}` reports.
// A default parameter of an ARROW function is deliberately excluded by that selector, and the
// exclusion is reproduced rather than tidied away.
//
// # The two sides must name the same thing, which is the whole guard against reporting nonsense
//
// The annotation has to be a plain type reference whose name matches the constructor's callee name,
// so `const a: Foo<string> = new Bar()` is silent: moving type arguments between two different names
// would produce code that does not compile. That test also excludes a qualified name, an array type,
// a union, and anything else that is not a bare identifier reference.
//
// # The typed-array exemption, which exists for a real conflict
//
// Nine built-in array types are exempt when the annotation names them: `Uint8Array` and its family.
// Upstream added this because those types became generic over their buffer, so `const a:
// Uint8Array = new Uint8Array()` and `new Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>()` are not interchangeable the way
// `Map` is. The exemption applies only when the name resolves to the GLOBAL, so a locally declared
// `class Uint8Array` is still reported. Reproduced here through the checker rather than through
// ESLint's scope analysis, which is the same question asked of a different instrument.
//
// # isolatedDeclarations, read from the compiler rather than from the lint config
//
// Upstream reads `parserOptions.isolatedDeclarations` and, when it is on, declines to move type
// arguments ONTO the constructor, because that mode needs the annotation to stay explicit. We do not
// have that lint-config field, and we do not need it: the real compiler option is on the program, so
// this reads `ctx.Program.Options().IsolatedDeclarations`. That is the brief's standing instruction
// that fidelity is to what the rule DECIDES rather than to how it obtains what it needs.
//
// It is also the one branch no fixture can reach. `rule_testing` writes its tsconfig AFTER the setup
// hook runs and always with the default settings, so a fixture cannot turn the option on; measured,
// with a setup hook writing its own tsconfig and the rule still seeing the option unset. Recorded in
// its own test with controls rather than left as an untested claim.
//
// # The repair, and the comments it goes out of its way to keep
//
// Both directions are FIXES rather than suggestions, matching upstream, because moving type arguments
// between two spellings of the same thing does not change what the code means.
//
// Moving them onto the constructor deletes the whole annotation, and an annotation can contain
// comments that are not inside the type arguments. Upstream collects those and re-emits them after
// the callee so they are not silently deleted, and this port does the same: a fixer that eats a
// comment is a fixer that loses something a person wrote, and it is applied unattended.
//
// The parenthesis case is the other detail: `new Foo` is a legal construction with no argument list,
// so after inserting type arguments the fixer has to add `()` as well, or it writes `new Foo<string>`
// which parses as something else entirely.
