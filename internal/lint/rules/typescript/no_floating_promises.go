// # Absorbed from tsgolint, which is the source of record for this rule
//
// Provenance: tsgolint `internal/rules/no_floating_promises/no_floating_promises.go`, fetched from
// `main` and absorbed onto cohere's own rule interface here. The checker logic is upstream's
// unchanged; what moved is the interface it speaks. `rule.RuleContext` became `rule.Context`,
// `RuleListeners` became `Listeners`, `RuleMessage` became `Message`, `RuleSuggestion{FixesArr:}`
// became `Suggestion{Fixes:}`, and the four `RuleFix*` builders became their `ctx.` equivalents,
// which trim to the token exactly as upstream's do. A line-by-line diff against the fetched file
// shows those renames, the two declared flags below, and the nil guard, and nothing else: no
// predicate, no traversal, no message text.
//
// It reaches for `type_checking.UnionTypeParts`, `IsPromiseLike`, `GetCallSignatures`, `Some` and
// `TypeMatchesSomeSpecifier` because that is what upstream reaches for, and this note is why a
// reader finds those helpers in a file that otherwise looks native. tsgolint is not re-synced, so
// this file is now the only copy of the algorithm rather than a translation layer over a vendored
// one.
//
// oxc declares this rule `(tsgolint)` and carries no algorithm and no corpus, so the behavior
// oxlint exhibits IS tsgolint's: the release binary shells out to a `tsgolint` executable and
// refuses to run the rule when that binary is absent, which is what it does on this machine. That
// refusal is itself the proof, so oxlint cannot serve as ground truth here and tsgolint's own test
// file is the corpus instead: seventy-two clean cases, ninety-seven reporting a hundred and
// forty-six findings, and two hundred and thirty-two exact suggestion outputs.
//
// # The option surface is FIVE keys, and a captured inventory said none
//
// A rule catalog recorded `"options": "no"` for this rule. It has five, and both references
// agree on all of them: `allowForKnownSafeCalls`, `allowForKnownSafePromises`, `checkThenables`,
// `ignoreIIFE`, `ignoreVoid`. Counted from tsgolint's option struct and confirmed against the
// plugin's `meta.schema` rather than taken from the inventory.
//
// `ignoreVoid` defaults to TRUE, which is the load-bearing default: it decides which of two message
// families a finding lands in and whether the void suggestion is offered at all. An unconfigured
// run therefore reports `floatingVoid` rather than `floating`, and the decoder keeps all three
// booleans as pointers end to end so that absent stays distinguishable from an explicit false.
//
// The two allowlists take TYPE SPECIFIERS, which is why `typecheck/specifier.go` is
// load-bearing here. Each entry is either a bare string matched against the type's own name, or an
// object whose `from` is `file`, `lib` or `package`. Those are two different fields in the struct
// the rule reads, so `DecodeNoFloatingPromisesOptions` below is hand-written rather than a
// `rule.DecodeOptionsInto` binding.
//
// A `from: file` specifier carrying a `path` compares that path, resolved against the program's
// current directory, to the DECLARING file's absolute name. That makes one upstream case depend on
// what upstream named its fixture, and the test file says how that is reproduced.
//
// # What counts as handled, measured rather than reasoned about
//
// The anchor is `KindExpressionStatement`, so the question is only ever asked of a promise that is
// a statement by itself. That is what makes the whole rule tractable and it is also why several
// shapes are silent for a structural reason rather than a decision. Measured, holding the promise
// fixed and varying only the position:
//
//	await p;                    SILENT    the await expression returns early
//	void p;                     SILENT    under ignoreVoid, which is the default
//	p.catch(() => {});          SILENT    a catch with a callable handler
//	p.then(() => {}, () => {}); SILENT    a then with a callable SECOND argument
//	p.finally(() => {}).catch(() => {});  SILENT    finally is transparent, so `p` is re-asked
//	const x = p;                SILENT    not an expression statement at all
//	y = p;                      SILENT    an assignment expression returns early
//	sink(p);                    SILENT    an argument is not a statement
//	({ a: p });                 SILENT    an object literal is not promise-like
//	p;                          REPORTS   floatingVoid
//	p.then(() => {});           REPORTS   floatingVoid, no rejection handler present
//	p.catch();                  REPORTS   floatingVoid, the arity guard is >= 1
//	p.catch(null);              REPORTS   floatingUselessRejectionHandlerVoid
//	p.finally(() => {});        REPORTS   floatingVoid, finally alone handles nothing
//	p, p;                       REPORTS   both sides of a comma are asked
//	true ? p : p;               REPORTS   both branches of a ternary are asked
//	p || p;                     REPORTS   both sides of a logical operator are asked
//	[p];                        REPORTS   floatingPromiseArrayVoid
//
// `p.catch()` landing on `floatingVoid` rather than on the useless-handler message is worth naming,
// because the message text invites the opposite reading: the arity guard is `>= 1`, so a `catch`
// with no arguments never reaches the handler test and falls through to "unhandled" instead.
//
// # An array of promises reports ONCE, and the reason is structural
//
// Probed with a TRIPLE rather than a pair, reading every position rather than the count:
//
//	[a, b, c];      ONE finding, floatingPromiseArrayVoid, pointing at the whole statement
//	a; b; c;        THREE findings, one per statement, each pointing at its own statement
//	Promise.all([a, b, c]);   ONE finding, floatingVoid, on the CALL rather than the array
//
// There is no grouping decision here to get wrong. The listener fires per statement, so per-element
// reporting is not a close call the corpus happens not to cover, it is unreachable. The
// `Promise.all` row is the one that could mislead: it is not a promise array at all, because the
// array is consumed by the call and what floats is the call's own promise.
//
// The promise-array findings carry NO suggestions, which is the one report path that uses plain
// `ReportNode`. Neither `await` nor `void` is a correct repair for an array, so upstream offers
// nothing rather than offering something wrong.
//
// # Where the two references disagree, measured on both
//
// Fifty-three inputs were run through this rule and through `@typescript-eslint`'s version driven
// by ESLint's flat-config Linter API, one fresh directory per case so the plugin's program is
// rebuilt each time, with a negative control to prove a non-zero was data rather than a
// config-resolution error. Fifty-one agree. Both sides register exactly ONE listener
// (`ExpressionStatement`), carry the same eight message ids, and ship suggestions rather than
// fixes; there is no equivalent here of the fourth arm `await-thenable` has on one side only.
//
// The two disagreements:
//
//	enum E { Catch = 'catch' }
//	p[E.Catch](() => {});        tsgolint SILENT    @typescript-eslint REPORTS
//	(p.catch)(() => {});         tsgolint REPORTS   @typescript-eslint SILENT
//
// The first is deliberate on tsgolint's side and upstream says so at the line: its `TODO(port)`
// notes that swapping `getStaticMemberAccessValue` for `Checker_getAccessedPropertyName` is "an
// enhancement" and that it lacks tests. The checker resolves the enum member to `'catch'`, so the
// promise reads as handled; the plugin reads only literal keys and does not.
//
// The second is the paren axis, and it falls the OPPOSITE way from `no-implied-eval`, where
// tsgolint is the silent one. The cause is the same structural difference in both rules and the
// direction is reversed by where the parens sit. This rule runs `ast.SkipParentheses` over the
// statement's expression, so `(p.catch(() => {}))` is transparent and silent on both sides. It does
// not skip again during the descent, so a parenthesized CALLEE leaves `ast.IsAccessExpression`
// declining and the handler test never runs. ESTree has no parenthesized-expression node, so the
// plugin never sees the parens at all. Three positions, three answers, in one rule:
//
//	(p.catch(() => {}));    SILENT    parens around the statement expression, skipped
//	(p).catch(() => {});    SILENT    parens around the receiver, the checker sees through
//	(p.catch)(() => {});    REPORTS   parens around the callee, the access test declines
//
// tsgolint wins on both, because oxlint runs tsgolint and the differential harness compares against
// oxlint. The corpus writes no parenthesized form anywhere, so this whole axis is invisible to the
// imported fixtures and is pinned by measured cases in the test file instead.
//
// # The library pinning does NOT bite here, and that was measured
//
// The fixture tsconfig pins `lib: ["ES2022"]` with no way to raise it, which inverted three
// `await-thenable` cases and moved nothing on `no-implied-eval`. It is a per-rule question and the
// answer is not predictable from the rule's shape, so it was run rather than inherited: ten shapes,
// each once bare and once with a second file merging onto the global scope. NO VERDICT MOVED.
// `Promise` and `PromiseLike` are declared in the ES2015 library that ES2022 includes, so the
// globals this rule cares about resolve properly under the pinning. That is the opposite of
// `Disposable`, which resolves to the error type and reports flags of `any`.
//
// # The checker, the program, and the nil guard
//
// Every type question routes through `ctx.TypeChecker`, so the checker is required and the fixtures
// use the typed harness.
//
// `ProgramReads` is a measurement rather than an assumption: the body reaches `ctx.Program` at three
// sites, one of them on the core path. `type_checking.IsPromiseLike(ctx.Program, ...)` asks whether a
// declaration is the default library's `Promise`, which happens for every promise test this rule
// makes, and the two `TypeMatchesSomeSpecifier` calls read the compiler options and the default
// library too. Enum-key resolution reaches the declaring module through the checker, which a fixture
// pins across two files; the type fingerprint is what keeps a cached finding honest about that.
//
// The nil guard is the one addition to the body and it could not be written before. While this rule
// lived behind the tsgolint adapter the listener was upstream's and the adapter set
// `NeedsTypeChecker` unconditionally, so the nil case was unreachable and editing the listener
// would have turned a re-sync into a merge. Absorbing the rule removes both constraints.
//
// The guard matters more than crash-avoidance would suggest. On this shim `GetTypeAtLocation` and
// `GetSymbolAtLocation` return nil rather than panicking, so a checker-less run would not blow up:
// `isPromiseLike` would answer false for everything and the rule would go completely silent.
// Ninety-seven reporting fixtures would fail in a way that reads like a rule defect while
// seventy-two clean ones passed VACUOUSLY. A test pins the declaration and the decline together, so
// a later revert fails loudly.
//
// # Cost
//
// The anchor is every expression statement, which is common, and unlike `no-implied-eval` there is
// no cheap syntactic filter before the checker: the first thing the descent does on most inputs is
// ask for a type. `isPromiseArray` runs before `isPromiseLike` and walks union parts asking for
// apparent types, so a statement whose expression is not a promise still costs one type read. That
// is upstream's ordering and it is kept.
