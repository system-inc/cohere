// `packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/no-unsafe-enum-comparison.ts` plus its judgment in
// `src/rules/enum-utils/shared.ts`. No options (`schema: []`), two messages, `hasSuggestions: true`
// and NO `fixable` key.
//
// The whole 85-case corpus was extracted from upstream's own tester and verified byte for byte
// through a second independent extraction.
//
// # The rule file is thin and the judgment is not
//
// `no-unsafe-enum-comparison.ts` is 106 lines and mostly plumbing: it reads two types and calls
// `isMismatchedEnumComparisonTypes`. That predicate lives in `enum-utils/shared.ts` and is where the
// whole port is. Sizing this rule by its own file would have been wrong by a factor of three, which
// is the trap the standard records for a thin rule over a shared substrate.
//
// # Every type capability this needs was probed before any code was written
//
// The constraint on this batch was that a missing type capability is a finding about the shelf
// rather than something to work around inside a rule. All of them are present, established with a
// compiling probe over four discriminating inputs rather than by grepping:
//
//	UnionTypeParts            splits `Fruit | Vegetable` into constituents
//	IsTypeFlagSet             EnumLiteral, NumberLike, StringLike, NumberLiteral all reachable
//	IsSymbolFlagSet           SymbolFlagsEnumMember distinguishes a member from its enum
//	Type_symbol               reaches a type's symbol
//	Symbol.ValueDeclaration   a plain field, used by four shipped rules
//	GetTypeAtLocation         used 81 times across this package
//
// The probe's four rows discriminated exactly as the rule requires: `fruit === 'apple'` shows two
// enum literals on the left against a stringLike non-enum on the right, `fruit === Fruit.Apple`
// shows an enum member on both sides, `Count.One === 1` shows the numeric form, and `1 === 2` shows
// neither side carrying an enum literal, which is the control that keeps the other three from being
// vacuous.
//
// # The suggestion is NOT ported, and that is a stated decline
//
// `meta.hasSuggestions` is true and `meta.fixable` is absent, so upstream offers a repair a human
// chooses rather than one the edit engine applies. 16 corpus cases carry one.
//
// The suggestion rewrites the literal side into an enum member reference, which needs
// `getEnumKeyForLiteral`: it matches a static value against each enum literal, then reconstructs a
// source-level name from the member's declaration, with three spellings depending on whether the
// member name is an identifier, a string literal, or a computed property. Reconstructing a
// REFERENCE rather than editing a span is the shape this repository has repeatedly got wrong, and
// `ReportNodeWithSuggestions` would need each of those three spellings pinned separately.
//
// Reporting without the suggestion is the subset that can be shown correct. The finding is what
// carries the value here; the suggestion is a convenience, and a wrong one rewrites a comparison
// into a different comparison. Recorded rather than silently omitted, and the 16 cases are in the
// corpus waiting if somebody wants it.
