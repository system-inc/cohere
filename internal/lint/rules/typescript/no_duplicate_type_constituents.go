// A repeated constituent is dead text: `A | A` is `A`, and the repetition usually means a rename or
// a merge went half-finished. The second message covers a narrower mistake, an explicit `undefined`
// on a parameter that is already optional, where the `?` has already added it.
//
// # Two questions are asked, and the order between them is load-bearing
//
// Upstream compares constituents by DEEP AST EQUALITY first and only then by type identity, and its
// comment says the first is a performance shortcut. It is not only that here, and the difference is
// measurable: two structurally identical object literals get DISTINCT type objects from the
// checker, so `{ a: 1 } | { a: 1 }` is invisible to a type-identity comparison and is caught only by
// the syntactic one. Probed directly before this rule was written, over twelve shapes.
//
// So both comparisons are reproduced, in upstream's order, and neither is an optimization of the
// other. The syntactic one is written here as a text comparison over the constituent's own token
// range rather than as a field-by-field walk of the node. That is a deliberate narrowing of
// upstream's `isSameAstNode`, which compares every key except `loc`, `parent` and `range`:
//
//	same text  =>  same tree, for a well-formed type node, because the text was parsed to produce it
//	same tree  =>  same text is NOT guaranteed, since `A|A` and `A | A` differ in trivia
//
// The second direction is where a text comparison could be narrower than upstream, and it cannot
// bite: the two constituents being compared are siblings in one union, so whitespace between them
// belongs to the separator rather than to either node, and `rule.TokenRange` starts each at its
// first real token. Measured over the whole corpus, all 82 cases agree.
//
// # Nested same-kind constituents are FLATTENED, and the parse tree makes that visible
//
// `A | (B | A)` is one union of two constituents whose second is a parenthesized union. Upstream
// recurses into a constituent whose own kind matches the enclosing one, so the inner `A` is compared
// against the outer `A` and reports. Our parser keeps `KindParenthesizedType`, which upstream's
// estree folds away, so the recursion here also has to step through the parenthesis to find the
// inner union. Without that step this rule would miss every parenthesized nesting.
//
// The top-level listener declines a node whose parent is the same kind, so a nested union is
// visited once through its parent's recursion rather than twice.
//
// # The repair removes an OPERATOR AND ITS CONSTITUENT, and the span is not the removal
//
// These are two different ranges and conflating them is the easy mistake.
//
// The REMOVAL runs from the separator before the constituent through the end of the constituent,
// including any parentheses around it and any comment between the separator and the node. When the
// duplicate is the FIRST constituent there is no separator before it, so the removal runs from the
// constituent through the separator after it instead. Measured against the installed build over
// every corpus case: the bytes that vanish are exactly `| A`, `& true`, `| /* comment */ A`,
// `| (A | B)`, or in the leading position `T |` and `number &`.
//
// The SPAN reported is narrower and starts inside any parentheses. For `A | (A | A)` the finding
// underlines `A | A)`, which reads oddly and is upstream's: the span begins at the inner
// constituent's own start and ends after the closing brackets that follow it. Reproduced rather
// than corrected, because the differential compares where findings land.
//
// The repair is a FIX rather than a suggestion, matching `meta.fixable: 'code'`. Removing a
// duplicate constituent cannot change what the type means, which is the whole finding.
//
// # One corpus case needs TWO passes and that is a real property of the fixer
//
// `type A = number & string & (number & string);` carries two findings whose repairs overlap in
// effect: applying both in one pass leaves `(  )`, and the fix engine runs to convergence, at which
// point the emptied parenthesis is itself removed. Upstream records that case with an `output`
// ARRAY of two states rather than one string. Our harness applies one pass, so the fixture for that
// case asserts the first state and says so at the line.
//
// # Cost
//
// The anchor is a union or intersection type node, and the checker is consulted once per
// constituent only after the syntactic comparison has failed to find a duplicate.
