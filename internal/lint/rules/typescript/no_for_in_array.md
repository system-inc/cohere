## What it checks

Disallow iterating over an array with a for-in loop

## Why this recommendation

Catches a defect rather than a preference, and the tree is already clean, so it is a guardrail bought for nothing.

## Violations

None. The tree already satisfies this rule, so enabling it is a guardrail against future drift rather than a cleanup.
