// Ported from `typescript/triple-slash-reference`, which oxc in turn ports from
// `@typescript-eslint/triple-slash-reference`.
//
// # A comment, not a node, which decides the whole shape of the port
//
// A triple-slash directive is trivia. There is no node to anchor a listener on, so the rule runs
// once per file out of a `KindSourceFile` listener rather than reacting to a kind, matching
// upstream's `run_once`. The comments come from `comments.ForFile`, the shared per-file scan, so a
// second rule asking for them in the same file pays nothing.
//
// # Position is load-bearing and it is not "anywhere in the file"
//
// A triple-slash comment is only a directive to TypeScript when it precedes the first statement,
// and upstream reproduces that: it scans comments in `0..first statement's span start`, falling
// back to the end of the program when there is no statement. So a directive written between two
// statements is not scanned at all.
//
// The subtlety is which position bounds the range. oxc's `span().start` is the statement's first
// **token**, so a directive sitting in the statement's own leading trivia is inside the range and
// reports. typescript-go's `Pos()` is where leading trivia *begins*, which would place the cutoff
// before the directive and silence it. `rule.TokenRange` is the translation, and the fixture pair
// that pins it is a directive above `const a = 1;` reporting while the same directive below it is
// silent. Both measured against the release binary.
//
// # The content test is `starts_with('/')`, and it is not a test for a line comment
//
// Upstream reads `comment.content_span()`, which strips exactly two characters from the front of
// any comment. For `/// x` that leaves `/ x`, which starts with a slash; for `// x` it leaves ` x`
// and for `/* x */` it leaves ` x `, both of which do not. So one slash test does the work of
// distinguishing a triple slash from a double one, and it looks like a test for comment kind while
// being a test on the third character.
//
// It is not equivalent to one, and the difference is reachable. A block comment written `/*/ ... */`
// has content beginning with a slash and **reports** on the release binary, as does `//// ...`.
// The corpus's block-comment passing case reads as evidence that block comments are exempt and is
// not: its content begins with a newline. Measured by changing that one character, which moves the
// verdict from silent to reporting. ESLint's implementation does gate on comment kind, so this is a
// place the two disagree and oxc is what the gate runs.
//
// # The attribute scan reads the first matching part and stops
//
// Upstream splits the text between `<reference ` and `/>` on whitespace, keeps the parts beginning
// `types=`, `path=` or `lib=`, and reads only the **first** one. So
// `/// <reference lib="foo" path="bar" />` is silent under the defaults because `lib` is read and
// `lib` defaults to always, while the same two attributes in the other order report `bar`. Both
// measured. A value containing an `=` declines entirely, because the split produces three parts and
// upstream requires exactly two.
//
// `no-default-lib` is not in the filter set and is not an option. A
// `/// <reference no-default-lib="true" />` never reports under any configuration, measured against
// the release binary rather than assumed from the directive's existence in TypeScript.
//
// # The prefer-import arm counts imports, not directives
//
// Under `types: prefer-import` a directive is recorded and reported only when a top-level import of
// the same specifier exists. The loop is over statements, so **two imports of one module produce
// two findings against one directive**, both with the same span. That is upstream's structure and
// there is no corpus case for it.
//
// The recording side is a map keyed by the reference name, so two directives naming the same module
// leave only the **last** span. Probed with a triple, which reports once against the third copy.
// This is the counting decision the brief warns hides inside a data-structure choice, and no
// message-id fixture can see it.
//
// Only a top-level `import ... from` and a top-level `import x = require(...)` count. A dynamic
// `import()`, a bare `require()` call, an `export * from`, and an import nested inside a
// `declare module` are all silent, each measured. That is why this does not reach for
// `imports.SourceVisitors`, which would widen the rule to the two call shapes upstream ignores.
