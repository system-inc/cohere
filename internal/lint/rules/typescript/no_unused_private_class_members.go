// A `private` member is visible only inside the class body that declares it, so one nothing there
// reads is dead weight the compiler will not mention. The `#private` half of the same question is
// the core rule of this name, which is already ported; this rule is the TypeScript keyword.
//
// # This is not a filter over the core rule, and the audit's line count says otherwise
//
// Upstream's file is sixty lines and delegates to `analyzeClassMemberUsage`, an 893-line scope
// analyzer in its shared utilities. So the real size is the analyzer, not the caller, which is the
// same trap the extension rules carry arriving through a different door: a shared helper rather
// than `getESLintCoreRule`.
//
// Measured against the core rule it sits beside, on upstream's own 99-case corpus driven through
// both: they agree on 72 cases and differ on 27, the wrapper producing 49 findings against the
// core's 20. Every one of the 27 mentions the `private` keyword, which the core cannot see at all,
// so there is no overlap to reuse and nothing here narrows the core.
//
// # Resolution replaces upstream's scope analysis, and answers better
//
// Upstream declares `requiresTypeChecking: false` and reaches a use through scope tracking: it
// follows `this` across nested scopes and chases aliases like `const self = this`. We have the
// checker, and `GetSymbolAtLocation` on a property NAME resolves straight to the declaring member.
// Probed on the three shapes upstream needs its analyzer for:
//
//	other.prop     where other: C          resolves to C's PropertyDeclaration
//	self.prop      after const self = this resolves to C's PropertyDeclaration
//	self2.prop     after a second alias    resolves to C's PropertyDeclaration
//
// This is the brief's rule about fidelity being to what a rule DECIDES rather than how it obtains
// what it needs. Reproducing an alias-chasing scope pass to answer a question one resolution call
// answers would be a workaround for a constraint we do not have.
//
// # And it produces a DIFFERENT ANSWER, in one direction, deliberately
//
// Upstream's reach has a hard edge that resolution does not. It follows `this`, ONE hop of
// `const self = this`, and a parameter annotated as the class. It does not follow two hops, and it
// does not follow a local holding an instance. Measured on the installed 8.67.0 build:
//
//	const a = this; a.prop                    clean in both
//	const a = this; const b = a; b.prop       upstream REPORTS, we are clean
//	method(thing: Foo) { return thing.prop }  clean in both, and in upstream's own corpus
//	const other = this.clone(); other.helper() upstream REPORTS, we are clean
//
// The member is genuinely read in every one of those, so upstream's reports are false positives.
// This rule declines to reproduce them, which is the brief's "a port is not obliged to carry a
// defect it can see", and the decline is stated here and pinned by a test rather than left silent.
//
// It is visible on the real tree rather than only in constructed cases: this rule finds three unused
// private members where upstream finds four, and the fourth is a method called eight lines above its
// own declaration through a local receiver. For an unused-thing rule the direction is the one that
// matters, since a false positive asks a reader to delete working code.
//
// # A use outside the class body is not a use
//
// `const c = new C(); c.privateThing;` resolves to the member and upstream still REPORTS it, which
// reads backwards until you notice the compiler already rejects that line. An illegal reference
// cannot keep a member alive, so the search is bounded to the declaring class's own body. Upstream
// gets that from its scope structure; here it is a containment test, and two of its cases pin it.
//
// # Read against write, which is most of the judgment
//
// A member only ever assigned is unused: `this.a = 42` keeps nothing alive. The shapes that count
// as write-only are enumerated rather than delegated to `ast.IsWriteAccess`, which answers "does
// this store" rather than "does this ONLY store" and misses a rest element entirely. That
// enumeration is the same one the core rule of this name arrived at, and it is repeated here rather
// than shared because the two rules live in different packages and the core's helpers are
// unexported. If a third caller ever wants it, that is the moment to lift it onto the shelf.
//
// An accessor is the exception: reading or writing one calls a function body either way, so any
// reference to a `private get` or `private set` is a use. That is decided from what the member IS
// rather than from the reference, and it is why a write-only setter is correct code.
//

//
// One pass per class, and the checker is asked only at a property access whose name matches a
// declared private member by text. A class with no `private` member registers nothing.
