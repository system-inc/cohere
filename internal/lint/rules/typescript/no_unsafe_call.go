// NoUnsafeCall flags calling, constructing, or tagging a template with a value typed `any`.
//
//	valid:   function foo(x: () => void) { x(); }
//	valid:   new Map();
//	valid:   String.raw`foo`;
//	valid:   interface SurprisinglySafe extends Function { (): string }  declare const safe: SurprisinglySafe; safe();
//	invalid: function foo(x: any) { x(); }
//	invalid: function foo(x: any) { new x(); }
//	invalid: function foo(x: any) { x`foo`; }
//	invalid: const t: Function = () => {}; t();
//
// Calling an `any` turns off every check the arguments and the return value would otherwise get, so
// a mistake at that call site is invisible until it runs. The bare `Function` type is the same
// problem wearing a type: it accepts any arguments and returns `any`, so it documents "callable"
// and checks nothing.
//
// # Four call sites, eight messages, and the pairing is what carries the meaning
//
// The rule fires on a call's callee, a `new` expression's callee, and a tagged template's tag. Each
// site has a pair of messages: an `unsafe` one naming what the type was, and an `error` one for a
// type the checker could not resolve at all. `NotKnown` in an annotation is not `any` the author
// wrote, it is the checker's error type, and saying "unsafe call of an `any` typed value" about it
// would send the reader looking for an `any` that is not there. The distinguishing test is
// `IsIntrinsicErrorType`, which reads the intrinsic name rather than the flags, because the error
// type carries the `any` flag too and a flag test alone cannot separate them.
//
// # The `Function` branch, whose asymmetry is upstream's and is not obvious
//
// A type that is or extends `Function` is judged by which signatures it has, and construction and
// calling ask DIFFERENT questions. Upstream's own comment says it does not understand why, and it
// is reproduced rather than tidied:
//
//	any construct signature            safe to both call and construct
//	a call signature                   safe to CALL and to tag
//	a NON-void-returning call signature safe to CONSTRUCT
//
// So `interface CallGoodConstructBad extends Function { (): void }` is safe to call and unsafe to
// construct, while adding an overload returning `string` makes it safe to construct as well. Three
// of upstream's passing cases and one of its reporting ones turn on exactly this, and a port that
// asked the same question at both sites would pass most of the corpus and fail those four.
//
// `Function` here means the global one. Upstream resolves it through `isBuiltinSymbolLike`, which
// checks the symbol came from a default library file, so a locally declared `type Function = () =>
// void` is an ordinary function type and stays silent. The corpus writes that case in a block scope
// precisely to pin it.
//
// # The `this` branch, and why no fixture in this package can reach it
//
// When `noImplicitThis` is OFF, an unannotated `this` is implicitly `any`, and upstream swaps the
// message for one that says so and suggests turning the compiler option on. That branch is ported
// below and it is UNREACHABLE THROUGH THIS PACKAGE'S TESTS, because the harness writes its own
// tsconfig with `strict: true` and no override, and it writes it AFTER the setup hook runs, so
// nothing a fixture can do changes the option. Probed rather than assumed, with a control: a rule
// reading `ctx.Program.Options()` under both `RunTyped` and `RunTypedFilesWithSetup` reports
// `strict true, noImplicitThis isTrueOrUnknown true` identically, and the hook's write of a
// different tsconfig is discarded.
//
// Upstream's entire corpus for this rule runs under `tsconfig.noImplicitThis.json`, so its two
// `this` cases assert message ids our harness cannot produce. Both were measured on the installed
// 8.67.0 build under BOTH settings rather than dropped:
//
//	                                      noImplicitThis false     noImplicitThis true (ours)
//	object literal `this.methodB()`       unsafeCallThis x2        SILENT
//	`function f(this: NotKnown) { ... }`  errorCallThis x2         errorCall x2
//
// The fixtures below assert the right-hand column, which is what upstream itself produces under our
// configuration, so the imported cases are pinned at the verdict our harness can actually observe
// rather than weakened or deleted. The left-hand column is recorded here because the branch is real
// and a later harness that can set compiler options should assert it.
//
// # Cost
//
// Three anchors, all common, and each one asks the checker immediately. That is upstream's shape
// too, and there is no cheaper pre-test available: whether a callee is `any` is precisely the
// question, so nothing syntactic can decline first.
