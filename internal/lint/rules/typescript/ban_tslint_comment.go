// it cites: https://github.com/palantir/tslint/blob/95d9d95/src/enableDisableRules.ts#L32
//
// It is anchored, so a directive has to open the comment's interior after optional whitespace. That
// anchor is what makes "a comment that merely mentions tslint" clean, which is four of upstream's
// five passing cases.
//
// The trailing group is the part a reader will misread. It requires the directive to be followed by
// a colon, whitespace, or end of interior, so `tslint:disabled` and `tslint:disable-foo` are silent
// while `tslint:disable:` and `tslint:disable extra` report. Measured against the installed
// @typescript-eslint 8.67.0 through the ESLint 10.8.1 Linter API rather than read off the pattern.

// Ported from `@typescript-eslint/ban-tslint-comment`, reading the clone at

// against the installed 8.67.0 build driven through the ESLint 10.8.1 Linter API.
//
// # A comment, not a node
//
// A directive is trivia, so there is no kind to anchor on. Upstream runs once per file out of a
// `Program` listener over `sourceCode.getAllComments()`; this runs out of `KindSourceFile` over
// `comments.ForFile`, the shared per-file scan.
//
// # No file gate, and that is a deliberate difference from its sibling
//
// `ban-ts-comment` in this package declines a JavaScript file, because a `@ts-ignore` there is how
// JavaScript opts into checking. This rule has no such gate and must not inherit one by analogy:
// upstream registers a plain `Program` visitor with no source-type test, and measured on the
// installed build, `// tslint:disable` reports in `a.js`, `a.mjs`, `a.ts` and `a.tsx` alike. A
// tslint directive is dead in every language it can appear in.
//
// # The subject is the comment's INTERIOR, and the span is the WHOLE comment
//
// The regex is tested against `c.value`, which is the text between the delimiters, so a JSDoc
// comment's leading star defeats the anchor and `/** tslint:disable */` is silent while
// `/* tslint:disable */` reports. The report is `node: c`, the comment itself, so the finding spans
// the delimiters that the match never saw. Both halves measured: the JSDoc case reports zero
// diagnostics, and `/* tslint:disable */` reports column 1 through end column 21 on a twenty-byte
// file.
//
// # The rendered text is normalized, not quoted
//
// `toText` trims the interior and rejoins it with single spaces around the delimiters, so the
// message never shows the comment's own spacing. Measured: `//   tslint:disable-line   ` renders as
// `// tslint:disable-line`, and `/*\n\ttslint:enable\n\t*/` renders as `/* tslint:enable */`. The
// trim is at the ends only, so an interior newline survives: `/* tslint:disable\n more */` renders
// with that newline intact. This matters because the corpus asserts the rendered text on every one
// of its eight reporting cases.
//
// # The fixer is destructive, and this port declines the destructive half
//
// Upstream removes `[start - 1, end + 1)`, taking one character before the comment and one after
// it, unconditionally except at column zero. On its own corpus that is exactly right: it removes
// the space in `someCode(); // tslint:disable-line` and the newline in a comment on its own line,
// and all eight upstream outputs reproduce byte for byte under this reading.
//
// Off the corpus it deletes code. Measured on the installed build with `cohereAndFix`:
//
//	x;// tslint:disable                silently becomes `x`      the semicolon is eaten
//	/* tslint:disable */let x = 1;     becomes `et x = 1;`       the `l` is eaten
//	\t// tslint:disable-line           becomes ``                the indent is eaten
//	x;  // tslint:disable              becomes `x; `             one of two spaces survives
//
// The second is refused by this project's parse guard. The first and third are not: both produce
// source that parses, so the guard is structurally unable to see them, and the edit engine applies
// a fix unattended. So this port narrows the range to the comment itself plus at most one character
// on each side WHEN THAT CHARACTER IS WHITESPACE, which reproduces every corpus output while
// declining to delete a character that is not blank. `banTslintCommentFixRange` holds the
// measurement and the four cases where the two readings differ.
//
// The judgment upstream makes is reproduced exactly: the same inputs report, at the same span, with
// the same rendered text. Only the repair is narrower, and it is narrower in the direction that
// cannot destroy source.

// banTslintCommentFixRange is the deliberately narrowed version of upstream's removal range.
//
// Upstream computes `[getIndexFromLoc(start.column - 1), getIndexFromLoc(end.column) + 1)`, so it
// always widens by one on each side, except that a comment starting at column zero cannot widen
// left. The intent is legible and correct on the shapes it was written for: eat the space that
// separated a trailing comment from the code before it, and eat the newline that would otherwise be
// left as a blank line.
//
// The implementation does not test what those characters are. Measured against the installed build,
// which is the reason this function exists rather than a straight transcription:
//
//	x;// tslint:disable             upstream `x`            here `x;`
//	/* tslint:disable */let x = 1;  upstream `et x = 1;`    here `let x = 1;`
//	\t// tslint:disable-line        upstream ``             here `\t`
//	x;  // tslint:disable           upstream `x; `          here `x; `      (agrees)
//
// The fourth agrees because the character before the comment is a space in both readings. All eight
// of upstream's own corpus outputs agree for the same reason: every one of them widens onto
// whitespace or onto nothing.
//
// The right edge is also clamped to the end of the source. Upstream hands ESLint a range one past
// the last byte and ESLint clamps it silently; this project's fixture harness refuses an
// out-of-range fix as a rule defect, correctly, since a range past the end is a range the author did
// not mean. Clamping produces the identical output, because removing to the end and removing past
// it are the same removal.

	// upstream's `column > 0` and it is NOT subsumed by the blank test, which is what a reader will
	// assume and what an earlier draft of this comment asserted. The character before a
	// column-zero comment is the newline that ENDED THE PREVIOUS LINE, which is blank, so a blank
	// test alone takes it. Measured on upstream's own eighth corpus case: with the column test the
	// fix writes `\nconst woah = doSomeStuff();\nconsole.log(woah);\n      `, and without it the
	// fix writes `\nconst woah = doSomeStuff();console.log(woah);\n      `, joining two statements
	// onto one line. Scored as a mutant, removing the column test fails that case.
	//
	// So the two conditions answer different questions. The column test asks whether there is
	// anything on this line before the comment; the blank test asks whether that thing is code.
