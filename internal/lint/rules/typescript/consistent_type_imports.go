// Ported from oxc's `consistent_type_imports`, which is what the gate runs.
//
// # The whole rule is one question asked per imported name
//
// For each name a declaration binds: does it have at least one reference, and is every one of those
// references a type reference? A name with no references at all answers no, deliberately, so an
// entirely unused import is silent here and left to the unused-import rules. That asymmetry is
// upstream's `is_only_has_type_references`, whose first act is to return false on an empty iterator,
// and it is pinned by the corpus's `import Foo from 'foo';` pass case.
//
// # What counts as a type reference is not `IsPartOfTypeNode`, and that was measured
//
// The obvious substrate for this is `ast.IsPartOfTypeNode`, and reaching for it alone loses three
// of the corpus's own failing shapes. Probed directly against the parser, `typeof Foo` inside a
// type alias gives a parent of `KindTypeQuery` with `IsPartOfTypeNode` answering **false**, and the
// left side of a qualified name such as `foo.Bar` gives `KindQualifiedName` with the same false. Both
// report upstream. So the predicate here is a walk that names those two kinds explicitly, and the
// corpus's `// TSTypeQuery` and `// TSQualifiedName` comments are upstream telling you the same
// thing.
//
// The opposite error is available too, and the parser hands us the discrimination for free. Probed
// on the release binary: `class C implements A {}` **reports** and `class C extends A {}` is
// **silent**. In this AST the `implements` name parses to `KindTypeReference` and the `extends` name
// to `KindExpressionWithTypeArguments`, so treating the latter as a type position would report a
// superclass as type-only and propose erasing an import the emitted code needs. There is no
// heritage-clause token to inspect; the parse shape already decided it.
//
// # Three sites resolve to the import through a different symbol
//
// `export { X }`, `export type { X }` and `export default X` put an identifier in the file that
// `GetSymbolAtLocation` resolves to the *export's* own symbol rather than the import's, so a rule
// matching on symbol identity sees no reference there at all and goes silent on six corpus cases.
// The recovery is `GetExportSpecifierLocalTargetSymbol`, which resolves an export specifier back to
// what it re-exports.
//
// Whether such a reference counts as a type is then decided by the export's own `type` keyword and
// not by position, which is the half a reading of the AST cannot supply. Measured on the release
// binary, all four with the same import:
//
//	export { Type };        SILENT   — a value export
//	export default Type;    SILENT   — a value export
//	export = Type;          SILENT   — a value export
//	export type { Type };   REPORTS  — a type-only export
//	export { type Type };   REPORTS  — likewise, per specifier
//
// Upstream reaches the same answers by a route worth recording, because it looks like it should
// give different ones. Its semantic builder marks all of these `Read | Type`, genuinely ambiguous,
// and then collapses the pair to a plain value reference during resolution whenever the symbol is
// value-capable, which an ordinary import alias always is. The ambiguity is real in the flags and
// resolved away before any rule sees it, so reproducing the flags rather than the outcome would be
// reproducing a mechanism instead of a decision.
//
// # JSX makes the JSX factory a value use
//
// In a file with JSX, the binding named for the JSX factory (`React` unless `jsxFactory` says
// otherwise) is a value use, under any import form, because ESLint's scope manager makes every JSX
// element a reference to it. In a file without JSX it is judged like any other name, so
// `import React from 'react'` used only as `React.FC` reports. This was a skip by local name, taken
// from oxc, until phi web found the gap; see `consistentTypeImportsJsxValueNames`.
//
// # The repair is upstream's, delivered as one edit
//
// Upstream's fixer yields several primitive edits per report (an insertion before the declaration,
// ` type` after `import`, a removal per moved specifier), and our engine refuses two insertions at
// one point, measured at zero applied and 1024 rejections when those were proposed side by side. So
// consistent_type_imports_fix.go computes the same primitive edits, applies them to the declaration's
// own text, and proposes the result as one replacement. Against upstream's corpus that reproduces
// its repair byte for byte, spacing included, on 69 of its 70 cases.
//
// The seventieth is the one deliberate divergence: upstream merges moved names into an `import type`
// that already exists elsewhere in the file, which is a second statement and so a second edit. Here
// they go into a new declaration beside the reported one. The repair moves only names the report
// found type-only, so a class decorator metadata serializes is never moved, and a declaration
// carrying import attributes, which a type-only import cannot have, reports with no repair.
