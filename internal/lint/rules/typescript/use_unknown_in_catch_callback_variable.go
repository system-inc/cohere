// UseUnknownInCatchCallbackVariable flags a rejection callback whose error parameter is typed as
// anything other than `unknown`.
//
//	valid:   Promise.resolve().catch((err: unknown) => { throw err; })
//	valid:   Promise.resolve().catch(() => { throw new Error(); })
//	valid:   declare const handler: (x: any) => void; Promise.reject().catch(handler)
//	invalid: Promise.resolve().catch((err: Error) => { throw err; })
//	invalid: Promise.resolve().catch(err => { throw err; })
//	invalid: Promise.resolve().then(() => {}, error => {})
//
// A rejection value is whatever was thrown, and anything can be thrown, so a callback annotating it
// as `Error` is asserting something the language does not guarantee. `unknown` forces the body to
// narrow before it reads a property, which is the whole point.
//
// # What decides a finding
//
// Two gates before the callback is even looked at. The callee must be a static member access naming
// `catch` or `then`, and the RECEIVER's type must be thenable. The name alone is not enough: the
// corpus writes `declare const notAPromise: { catch: (f: Function) => void }` precisely so that a
// port keying on the name reports it and fails.
//
// Which argument is checked depends on the method: `catch` takes the handler first, `then` takes it
// second. Upstream carries that as a table of two rows and this reproduces it as one, because the
// `append` column is the only other thing that varies and it is derivable from the method.
//
// The verdict on the callback itself comes from the CHECKER rather than from the annotation's text.
// `isFlaggableHandlerType` walks the union parts of the argument's type, and for each call signature
// asks whether the first parameter's type is intrinsic `unknown`. That is why `type U = unknown` is
// clean while `any` reports: the alias resolves to the intrinsic and the flag test sees through it.
// Measured on the installed rule, both directions.
//
// A signature with NO first parameter is skipped rather than reported, so `catch(() => {})` is
// clean. A union part with no call signatures is skipped too, which is what makes
// `(() => void) | 2` clean.
//
// # Why this walks the argument instead of testing it
//
// The argument can be an expression that RESOLVES to several function literals, and upstream reports
// each one separately. `collectFlaggedNodes` recurses through a logical expression into both sides,
// through a conditional into both branches, and through a sequence into its LAST element only.
// Measured: `catch((() => {}, (err: Error) => {}))` reports and `catch(((err: Error) => {}, () => {}))`
// is clean, which pins the last-element rule rather than leaving it read off the source.
//
// Anything else terminates the walk, and that is a deliberate narrowness rather than an oversight.
// A bare identifier bound to a badly-typed handler is CLEAN upstream, with a comment and an issue
// link in the corpus saying so: the rule only wants function literals written at the call site,
// because those are the ones the author can fix here. A type assertion is likewise not a literal and
// is clean.
//
// # Parentheses, which are two decisions here rather than one
//
// ESTree has no parenthesis node, so upstream's walk never mentions parens and gets paren
// transparency for free. Our AST makes them real nodes, so every place upstream sees through them
// this must skip explicitly, and there are three: the argument itself, each recursion into a
// sub-expression, and the callee. Measured against the installed rule, all three are transparent
// there: `catch((err => {}))`, `(p.catch)(err => {})`, and the corpus's own
// `(condition && (err => {})) || (err => {})` all report.
//
// The skips are NOT free correctness. `ast.SkipParentheses` dereferences its argument, so each call
// is guarded by the caller having a non-nil node, and `useUnknownSkipParentheses` exists to make
// that a property of the helper rather than of every call site.
//
// # Where the finding points, which is never the callback
//
// Upstream reports `node: argument` and then unconditionally overrides it from
// `refineReportIfPossible`, whose switch covers every shape a first parameter can take. So in
// practice the span is always the FIRST PARAMETER, and the callback span is unreachable. Verified
// against the installed rule across identifier, annotated, optional, defaulted, rest, array-pattern
// and object-pattern parameters: all seven report the parameter.
//
// This port therefore reports the parameter directly and has no callback-span arm to be wrong about.
// The one place upstream's fallthrough could fire is a first parameter that is none of those kinds,
// and TypeScript has no such shape.
//
// # The `this` parameter, an upstream defect reproduced deliberately
//
// A `this` parameter is not a real parameter: the CHECKER's signature omits it, while both ESTree's
// `params` and our `Parameters()` include it. Upstream reads the checker to DECIDE (so it judges the
// first real parameter) and reads the syntax to REPORT (so it points at `this`). The two disagree,
// and the suggestion it offers would write `function (this: unknown, err: Error)`, which is wrong
// code.
//
// Measured on the installed rule, with controls that pin the mechanism rather than the symptom:
//
//	p.catch(function (this: W, err: Error) {})    reports, span "this: W", suggests ": unknown" over ": W"
//	p.catch(function (this: W, err: unknown) {})  CLEAN, which proves the decision reads `err`
//	p.catch(function (this: W) {})                CLEAN, which proves `this` is no checker parameter
//
// Our AST agrees with ESTree here (probed: `Parameters()` has two entries, the checker signature has
// one), so reproducing this costs nothing and diverging would cost fidelity. It is reproduced, and
// the fixture pinning it says it is a defect so the next reader does not helpfully correct it.
//
// # The suggestions, and why there is no fix
//
// Upstream declares `hasSuggestions` and no `fixable`, so every repair here needs a human. That is
// right: rewriting a callback's error type changes what the body is allowed to do with it, and the
// body will usually stop compiling until the author narrows. The engine must not do that unattended.
//
// The annotation-replacement span is the one piece of arithmetic that is not a node. Our type node
// starts AFTER the colon and carries leading trivia, so replacing it would produce `err:: unknown`
// or eat a comment. The span upstream replaces is the colon through the type, which here is
// "just past the name, or just past the `?` if there is one" to the type's end. Measured against the
// installed rule's own byte ranges: `(err?: string)` replaces [29,37] and `(err: any /* c1 */ = 2)`
// replaces [28,33], and both are reproduced by that arithmetic.

// literal is silent on the first and a port accepting any identifier reports the second.
//
// Upstream answers this with ESLint's `getStaticValue`, a constant folder over the SCOPE. We answer
// it with the checker, through `getAccessedPropertyName`, which is the same question asked of the
