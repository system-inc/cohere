// NoUnsafeMemberAccess flags reading a property off a value typed `any`.

//	valid:   declare const x: any; x?.a;                   with allowOptionalChaining
//	valid:   declare const x: { a: number }; x[1];

//	invalid: declare const x: { a: number }; declare const k: any; x[k];
//	invalid: declare const x: any; x.a.b.c;                reports once, on `.a`
//
// Reading a property off an `any` is where a chain stops being checked. Nothing downstream of that
// dot is verified, and the type system will not mention it again, so a typo in the property name
// survives to runtime.
//
// # Six messages across two anchors, and the pairing carries the judgment
//
// A property access reports on the property, saying whether the object was an `any` the author
// wrote, a type the checker could not resolve, or an implicitly-`any` `this`. A computed access
// reports a second, separate thing: the KEY itself being `any`, which is a different defect at the
// same site. `x[k]` where `k` is `any` is unsafe even when `x` is perfectly typed.
//
// # One report per chain, and the innermost one
//
// `x.a.b.c` on an `any` reports ONCE, on `.a`, because the outer accesses are unsafe only as a
// consequence. Upstream gets that with a memoized recursion: each access asks its object first, and
// an object that came back unsafe short-circuits without reporting again. Measured on the installed
// 8.67.0 build, which reports exactly one finding spanning `a`.
//
// That recursion is also why the cache exists rather than being an optimization. Our walk is
// pre-order, so the OUTERMOST access is visited first and recurses inward; the inner ones are then
// visited again by the walk and must not report a second time. The cache is what makes the second
// visit a lookup.
//
// # Upstream's heritage exclusion has no shape to exclude here
//
// Upstream's selector excludes a member expression inside a class `implements` or an interface
// `extends`, because estree parses `implements Foo.Bar` as a MemberExpression and the rule would
// otherwise type it as a value. Probed here: our parser gives that a `KindTypeReference` holding a
// qualified name, which is not a property access at all and never reaches either listener. The
// exclusion is therefore not ported, and that is a shape difference rather than a dropped rule.
// Measured on the installed build to confirm the verdict rather than only the mechanism: both
// `class C implements Foo.Bar {}` and `interface I extends Foo.Bar {}` are clean there, and both
// are clean here.
//
// # `allowOptionalChaining` marks a link chained, not safe
//
// With the option on, `x?.a` is skipped. It is NOT treated as safe, and the difference shows one
// link further out: measured, `x?.a.b` with the option on still reports on `.b`, because the
// chained state is recorded and then the outer access asks the checker about its own object anyway.
// A port that recorded "safe" would go silent on that second access.
//
// # The `this` branch, and why no fixture in this package can reach it
//
// Upstream runs this corpus under `tsconfig.noImplicitThis.json` and our harness pins `strict:
// true`. Measured against the installed 8.67.0 build under BOTH settings: thirty-five of
// thirty-six cases are identical, and the object-literal `this` case reports three
// `unsafeThisMemberExpression` findings under upstream's configuration and is COMPLETELY SILENT
// under ours, because `this` in an object literal is typed as the literal rather than `any` when
// the option is on. The branch is ported and the fixtures assert the silence our harness can
// observe, with the other column recorded here.
//
// # Cost
//
// Two anchors, both extremely common, and this is the most expensive rule in this batch on the real
// tree. The cache keeps a chain to one checker question per link rather than one per link per
// visit, and the computed-key listener declines a literal and an update expression before asking
// anything, which is upstream's own optimization and is worth keeping for the same reason.
