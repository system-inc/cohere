// covers 205 of the corpus's 345 reporting cases. This file implements the `||` arm, which is 133
// cases, and the other two arms are absent rather than approximated. See the test file for the exact
// corpus split and for what a reader should expect from `--rules` today.
//
// A partial rule is registered rather than withheld because the `||` arm is the one that fires on
// real source, and a rule that reports a true subset is useful where one that guesses at the other

//
// # The type gate is upstream's `isNullableType`, and the shelf's IsTypeFlagSet is the WRONG helper
//
// This is the same trap as `consistent-return`'s, in a far worse form. Upstream imports two
// different functions both spelled `isTypeFlagSet`:
//
//	isNullableType(type)              typescript-eslint's, which decomposes a union FIRST
//	tsutils.isTypeFlagSet(type, ...)  ts-api-utils', which reads the type's OWN flags
//
// `checking.IsTypeFlagSet` is the second reading. It is correct for the two `ignorePrimitives` call
// sites and wrong for this gate, so which spelling a call site wants is a PER-CALL-SITE question
// rather than a per-rule one. Reading the import once and applying the answer throughout is the
// natural shortcut and it is exactly wrong here.
//
// The cost is not a few cases, it is the whole rule. `isNullableType` is the FIRST gate, and every
// shape this rule fires on is a nullable UNION, which carries the Union flag rather than its
// constituents'. Measured across eight shapes, then scored as a consequence with a control:
//
//	string | null          shelf false   upstream true    DIVERGE
//	string | undefined     shelf false   upstream true    DIVERGE
//	number | null          shelf false   upstream true    DIVERGE
//	{ a?: string }.a       shelf false   upstream true    DIVERGE
//	string                 shelf false   upstream false   agree
//	null                   shelf true    upstream true    agree
//	any                    shelf true    upstream true    agree
//
//	on the rule's own target shapes:  upstream 4/4 nullable, shelf 0/4
//
// A port built on the shelf helper reports zero on every real file AND is green, because an author
// who misread the helper writes fixtures matching what their code does. No mutation sweep and no
// span assertion can vote on that. Hence the local helper below, with a fixture on each of the four.
//
// # The span is the OPERATOR token, which is also why optional chaining costs nothing here
//
// Upstream reports `barBarOperator`, the `||` token itself, rather than the expression. Measured
// against the installed 8.67.0 build: `a || b` reports columns 13 to 15 for a left operand ending at
// 12.
//
// That anchor is also why ESTree's ChainExpression wrapper never gates this rule: `a?.b || c`
// reports exactly like `a || c`, because the rule looks at the operator and not at the member
// access. Predicted as a divergence, measured as a non-divergence, and stated here so the next
// reader does not re-derive the worry.
