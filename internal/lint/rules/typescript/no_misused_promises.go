//	invalid: [1, 2].filter(async n => n > 1);         // predicate — the array gets Promises, not booleans

//	invalid: const obj = { ...Promise.resolve({ a: 1 }) };                 // spread
//
// A Promise in a boolean position is always truthy, so `if (p)` takes the true branch whether the
// work succeeded or failed, and `arr.filter(async …)` filters on Promise objects rather than on what
// they resolve to. Both compile. Neither does what the author wrote it to do, and both are silent at
// runtime rather than throwing, which is what makes this worth a type-aware rule rather than review.
//
// # Absorbed from tsgolint, which is the source of record for this rule
//
// Provenance: tsgolint `internal/rules/no_misused_promises/no_misused_promises.go`, at commit
// `076823b`, absorbed onto cohere's own rule interface here. It reaches for `GetCallSignatures`,
// `GetConstructSignatures`, `IsThenableType`, `IsArrayMethodCallWithPredicate`, `GetHeritageClauses`,
// `IsRestParameterDeclaration`, `UnionTypeParts`, `IsTypeFlagSet`, `Some`, `Map`, `Flatten` and `Ref`
// because that is what upstream reaches for, and this note is why a reader finds those helpers in a
// file that otherwise looks native.
//
// The vendoring step is measurable and was measured: rewriting exactly four import paths
// (`microsoft/typescript-go/shim/` to `microsoft/TypeScript/tsc/shim/`, and
// `typescript-eslint/tsgolint/internal/{rule,utils}` to ours) produces a byte diff showing those four
// lines and nothing else. Every helper the rule calls was already on the shelf at
// `internal/utilities/typecheck/`, and every checker entry point it needs is reachable through
// our shim.
//
// tsgolint is not re-synced, so this file is now the only copy of the algorithm rather than a
// translation layer over a vendored one. The checker logic below is byte-identical to upstream's;
// what changed is the interface it speaks, plus the nil-checker guard described below. No predicate,
// no flag set, no defaulting block and no traversal was touched, and both options structs came across
// field for field rather than being re-declared.
//
// oxc declares this rule as a tsgolint delegate and carries no algorithm and no corpus, so the
// behavior oxlint exhibits IS tsgolint's: the release binary shells out to a `tsgolint` executable
// and refuses to run the rule when that binary is absent, which is what it does on this machine
// (`Failed to find tsgolint executable`). That refusal is itself the proof, so oxlint cannot serve as
// ground truth here and tsgolint's own test file is the corpus instead.
//
// # THREE independent checks, and one of them is an object of sub-flags
//
// This is the most structurally complex rule in this family, and the shape is the thing to hold:
//
//	checksConditionals  default TRUE   a Promise in a boolean position, plus array predicates
//	checksVoidReturn    default TRUE   a Promise-returning function where void was expected
//	checksSpreads       default TRUE   a Promise spread into an object
//
// `checksConditionals` also takes upstream's object, `{flagUnions}`, which turns the check on and
// says how a union holding a thenable is judged: "none" (the default, and what `true` means) reports
// only a value every member of which is thenable, "all" any union holding one, and "strict" only
// `Promise<T> | T`, whose awaited types are the union's other members, each assignable both ways.
// Checked against upstream's 34 checksConditionals rows and edge rows in
// no_misused_promises_conditionals_corpus_test.go.
//
// `checksVoidReturn` is not one check. It gates SIX sub-flags, each of which is a distinct position
// in the syntax and a distinct message id, and each of which registers its own listeners:
//
//	arguments         voidReturnArgument         KindCallExpression, KindNewExpression
//	attributes        voidReturnAttribute        KindJsxAttribute
//	inheritedMethods  voidReturnInheritedMethod  KindClassDeclaration/Expression, KindInterfaceDeclaration
//	properties        voidReturnProperty         KindPropertyAssignment, KindMethodDeclaration,
//	                                             KindShorthandPropertyAssignment
//	returns           voidReturnReturnValue      KindReturnStatement
//	variables         voidReturnVariable         KindVariableDeclaration, and the assignment arm of
//	                                             KindBinaryExpression
//
// That set is established from upstream's struct and from the corpus rather than guessed: all six
// message ids appear in tsgolint's own test file, so all six positions demonstrably report
// (voidReturnArgument 32 times, voidReturnInheritedMethod 25, voidReturnProperty 15, voidReturnVariable
// 6, voidReturnAttribute 3, voidReturnReturnValue 2). A port that invented this set would have passed
// every fixture it also invented, which is why the count is recorded here.
//
// A captured rule inventory described the option surface for this rule and it was not to be trusted as the
// authority; upstream's struct is. That is the standing lesson of this lane rather than a remark
// about this entry.
//
// # The pointer fields are load-bearing and must not be flattened to plain bools
//
// EVERY option on this rule defaults to TRUE — all three top-level checks and all six void-return
// sub-flags. That is nine fields whose default is not the zero value, so a plain `bool` could not
// tell "the user wrote false" from "the user wrote nothing", and the entire defaulting block at the
// top of `Run` reads exactly that distinction. Flattening any of them would silently turn the whole
// rule off for a config that merely omitted a key. `ChecksVoidReturnOpts` is a pointer to a struct
// for the same reason one level up.
//
// # Where the two references disagree, counted rather than assumed
//
// Listeners were counted on both sides rather than assumed, because a sibling in this family
// (`await-thenable`) had a fourth arm in `@typescript-eslint` that tsgolint lacks entirely. Here the
// two agree on every arm, and the two apparent differences are representational rather than
// behavioral:
//
//	SPREAD.       tsgolint registers KindSpreadElement AND KindSpreadAssignment; the plugin registers
//	              SpreadElement alone. That is because ESTree spells an object spread as a
//	              SpreadElement inside an ObjectExpression while typescript-go gives it its own kind.
//	              Same inputs, two spellings.
//
//	PREDICATES.   tsgolint registers KindPropertyAccessExpression and KindElementAccessExpression and
//	              then requires the parent to be a call; the plugin writes the selector
//	              `CallExpression > MemberExpression` and lets ESLint do that filtering. Same
//	              predicate, different layer.
//
//	VARIABLES.    tsgolint's assignment arm hangs off KindBinaryExpression guarded by
//	              `IsAssignmentExpression`; the plugin has a dedicated AssignmentExpression node.
//	              Same rule, different grammar.
//
// The one genuine, user-visible disagreement is MESSAGE TEXT on the spread id: the plugin renders
// "Expected a non-Promise value to be spread in an object" and tsgolint renders "…to be spreaded in
// an object". Upstream's wording is an error of English and it is reproduced here unrepaired, because
// oxlint runs tsgolint and the differential harness compares against oxlint, so correcting it would
// read as a difference the harness can see. A fixture asserts the exact rendered text so the next
// sync notices if upstream fixes it.
//
// # There are no fixes and no suggestions
//
// tsgolint ships neither for this rule, and neither does the corpus assert any. There is nothing for
// `rule_testing` to apply and nothing needing a hand-rolled suggestion applier. Upstream carries two
// `TODO(port)` markers at report sites where `@typescript-eslint` narrows the reported range to a
// function's head (`getFunctionHeadLoc`), and one at `getMemberIfExists` where it would escape leading
// underscores. All three are carried across unchanged, so a member named `__proto__` resolves through
// the un-escaped path exactly as it does upstream.
//
// # The checker, and the nil guard that is now reachable
//
// Every listener consults `ctx.TypeChecker`, so this needs the checker and its fixtures use
// `RunTyped`. While this family was adapted through `internal/rules/upstream`, the standing
// `if ctx.TypeChecker == nil` could not be written, because the listener bodies were upstream's and
// that adapter set `NeedsTypeChecker` unconditionally, which made the nil case unreachable. That
// adapter is gone. Absorbing the rule makes the nil case REACHABLE, so the guard is written here.
//
// The direction matters more than usual. Under a checker-less Context this rule does not panic: our
// shim's `GetTypeAtLocation` and `GetSymbolAtLocation` return nil rather than crashing, so the rule
// would go SILENT, and silence makes every clean fixture pass having proven nothing — which for this
// rule is ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THREE of its two hundred and thirteen cases. The guard sits at the
// top of `Run` rather than inside each of the fourteen listeners, which is strictly stronger: no
// listener is even registered, so no arm can be added later that forgets it.
// `TestNoMisusedPromisesRequiresTheTypedHarness` pins the declaration and the guard together so a
// later revert fails loudly instead of going vacuously green.
//
// # Cost
//
// This is the most expensive rule in the family and it should be read that way. It registers up to
// fourteen listeners, several on kinds that appear on nearly every line (call expressions, binary
// expressions, property access, variable declarations), and most arms reach the checker before they
// can decline. Upstream's `checkArguments` resolves the callee's type and then walks every signature's
// every parameter for every call in the file, and its JSX arm resolves every attribute's contextual
// type; both now ask the cheap half of their conjunction first, which is the one departure from
// upstream's order (#hekjpw3). The syntactic escape hatches upstream wrote — `isPossiblyFunctionType`
// on return statements and variable declarations, the `Arguments() == nil` early exit — exist for
// exactly that reason and are carried across rather than being treated as optional.
var NoMisusedPromises = rule.Rule{
	Name: "@typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises",

	// Every listener consults the checker; see the note above on why the guard lives in Run.
	NeedsTypeChecker: true,

	// rule reaching past its own file. While this family was adapted, `upstream.Adapt` declared the
	// flag on every rule it wrapped by assumption; absorbing makes it answerable per rule, and the
	// honest answer here is no.
	//
	// Worth knowing for whoever writes the next one of these: the guard in `internal/dispatch` that
	// enforces the flag is TEXTUAL, a grep for the selector over the rule's whole file, comments
	// included. So a doc comment that merely NAMES the thing it is declining to use fails the guard
