		"two return the same match object, but `exec` says what it does at the call site and is " +

// PreferRegexpExec reports `String#match` used where `RegExp#exec` would do.
//
//	valid:   'str'.match(/pattern/g);          a global flag makes match the right call
//	valid:   'str'.match(/a/, extra);          not a one-argument call
//	valid:   notAString.match(/a/);            the receiver has to be a string
//	invalid: 'str'.match(/pattern/);
//	invalid: 'str'.match('pattern');
//	invalid: str.match(regexpVariable);        when the variable's regex has no `g`
//
// # Why this rule needs the checker, and what it asks it
//
// The receiver must be a string, and that is a type question rather than a syntactic one: `s.match`
// where `s` is `'a' | 'b'`, or `string & { __brand: void }`, or a type parameter constrained to a
// string union, all count. `type_checking.GetTypeName` is upstream's `getTypeName` line for line,
// including the union, intersection and type-parameter-constraint arms that decide exactly those
// three shapes, so this rule calls it rather than re-deriving the judgment.
//
// The argument's type is asked separately and drives which of two repairs applies: a RegExp argument
// becomes `argument.exec(receiver)`, a string argument becomes `RegExp(argument).exec(receiver)`, and
// anything else is not reported at all.
//
// # The `g` flag decides the verdict, and reading it needs a value rather than a type
//
// A global regex must stay a `match`, because `exec` returns one match where a global `match`
// returns all of them -- so reporting it would change what the code does. Upstream answers "does
// this definitely lack a `g`" with `getStaticValue`, a general constant folder from eslint-utils
// with its own scope analyser: 476 lines of operations table plus identifier resolution.
//
// There is no such evaluator here, and porting one would be a substrate rather than a rule. What
// this rule actually needs from it is narrower and the checker answers it directly. Measured with a
// probe: `ctx.TypeChecker.GetSymbolAtLocation` on a reference to `const r = /x/g` resolves to the
// declaration, whose initializer is the regex literal with its flags intact. So the question
// "what regex is this identifier bound to" is answered by symbol resolution rather than by scope
// tracking, and the two agree on every shape the corpus and the tree contain.
//
// Where the answer is genuinely unknowable -- a regex built from a runtime value, a `let` reassigned
// elsewhere -- upstream's rule is to stay SILENT, and that direction matters: the guard is
// `definitelyDoesNotContainGlobalFlag`, so an unproven absence of `g` is treated as a possible `g`
// and nothing is reported. A port that inverted this would rewrite global matches and change
// behaviour, which is why the helper below is named for what it proves rather than for what it
// checks.
//
// # The fixer's parenthesisation is upstream's `getWrappingFixer`, and its predicate already ships
//
// `checking.IsStrongPrecedenceNode` is that helper's core test, already ported and already used by
// three rules here. An inner node that is not strongly precedent gets wrapped, which is why
// a template-literal receiver comes out parenthesised, matching upstream: a template literal is
// absent from upstream's list too, so upstream wraps it as well. Measured against the installed
// build rather than inferred, because the redundant-looking parentheses read like a defect.
//
// The outer half is the one that changes meaning if dropped: when the call sits under a weaker
// operator, the whole replacement is wrapped, so `a.match(/x/) || b` becomes `(/x/.exec(a)) || b`.
// Upstream's corpus contains no such case -- every one of its twelve reporting cases has a bare
// identifier or literal receiver in statement position -- so this is measured from the installed
// build directly and pinned in a fixture of its own.
