// All 239 rows of upstream's two test files, and edge rows for what they leave open, were replayed
// through the installed rule (typescript-eslint 8.71.0) and are replayed here by
// TestNoShadowUpstreamCorpus; no_shadow_corpus_data_test.go says how.
//
// The checks run in upstream's order: `allow`, a `declare` in a definition file, then the search for
// the shadowed binding, then the type-and-value, function-type-parameter, static-generic and
// declaration-merging carve-outs, then the initializer tests, then the temporal dead zone.
//
//   - builtinGlobals: when no enclosing binding has the name, a global ESLint or the program's lib
//     declares is the shadowed one, reported as `noShadowGlobal`. The set is no-redeclare's
//     (builtin_globals.go). A script's top level IS the global scope, which upstream never examines,
//     so its declarations are clean and only its nested scopes can shadow a builtin; ruled on #e1zk9s0
//     for no-redeclare, and the same TypeScript notion of a script applies here. Upstream's rows that
//     configure `globals` are pinned, since cohere carries no globals configuration.
//   - hoist: which outer declarations are already in scope before they are written, below.
//   - ignoreOnInitialization: a shadow inside a function expression passed to a call that sits in
//     the outer binding's initializer, below at bindingIsInitializedThrough.
//
// Four default behaviours changed with the replay, each where cohere disagreed with the installed
// rule: a function's first declaration hoists only when it has a body, so an overload set does not;
// a bodiless function's name counts with the function-type parameter names; a binding merged from
// several declarations reports once, at its first; and the finding's span runs through the
// identifier's `?`, `!` and type annotation, as upstream's Identifier node does.
//
// # The scope graph is the binder's, not one this rule builds
//
// Upstream is written entirely against eslint-scope: walk every scope, enumerate `scope.variables`,
// and for each ask `findVariable(scope.upper, name)`. That reads as a missing substrate here and is
// not one. TypeScript's binder already populates a per-container symbol table, reachable through
// `ast.IsLocalsContainer` plus `ast.GetLocals`, and it answers the same question.
//
// Two consequences, both measured:
//
//   - The table is EMPTY under `rule_testing.Run` and populated under `RunTyped`, because the
//     binder runs with the program. So this rule declares NeedsTypeChecker for BINDING, not because
//     it asks any type question. Declared false it would receive a nil checker and an empty table,
//     and go silently, vacuously clean on every file.
//   - `ast.GetLocals` PANICS on a node that is not a locals container rather than returning nil, and
//     an enum declaration is a shape that reaches it. Every call here is guarded by
//     `ast.IsLocalsContainer` first.
//
// # Three shapes the binder answers differently from eslint-scope, and each is load bearing
//
// **Declaration merging does the work of upstream's `isTypeValueShadow` and its namespace cases.**
// In eslint-scope `const x = 1; type x = string;` is two variables in one scope and upstream needs
// an option to stop reporting it. Here the binder MERGES them into a single symbol carrying
// `0x80002` (BlockScopedVariable plus TypeAlias), so there is one entry in the table and no pair to
// compare. Measured the same way for `class Foo {} namespace Foo {}` (`0x220`) and for
// `class Foo {} interface Foo {}`. Those corpus cases come out clean without a carve-out, which is
// why no ignoreTypeValueShadow logic appears below.
//
// **A function-expression or class-expression NAME is in no table at all.** Upstream gives each its
// own `functionExpressionName` scope holding exactly that name, and ten-plus corpus cases turn on
// it. Measured here: for `(function a() {})`, `a` is absent from the expression's own locals and
// from its parent's, and is reachable only as the symbol on the name node itself. So those bindings
// are collected from AST SHAPE rather than from the scope tables, in collectExpressionNames below.
//
// **An interface declaration is NOT a locals container either, and this one is not in the probe
// package's map.** Its type parameters are therefore invisible to the walk the same way an enum's
// members are, and they come off `InterfaceDeclaration.TypeParameters` instead. A type ALIAS *is* a
// locals container and needs none of this, which is what makes the absence easy to miss: the two
// read as the same construct and behave differently. Found by driving the installed rule over
// shapes the corpus does not write, because upstream's defaults corpus contains no interface type
// parameter anywhere.
//
// **An enum declaration is NOT a locals container.** `ast.IsLocalsContainer` answers false for it,
// so the general walk cannot see its members at all. They live on the enum symbol's `Exports`
// table instead, which is why the enum arm reads a different accessor from everything else.
//
// # hoist: which outer declarations are in scope before they are written
//
// An inner binding declared textually BEFORE the outer one it shadows is reported only when the
// outer declaration hoists under the setting. `functions-and-types`, the default, hoists a function
// declaration with a body, an interface and a type alias; `functions` and `types` hoist one half;
// `never` hoists nothing, and `all` reports every such shadow. An outer `var`, `let`, `const` or class
// never hoists, so before it is written the inner binding shadows nothing yet.
//
//	{ let a; } function a() {}   reports by default, the function hoists
//	{ let a; } var a;            clean unless hoist is all
//
// A function hoists by its FIRST declaration, upstream's `defs[0]`, and the first of an overload set
// is a bodiless signature (upstream's TSDeclareFunction), which is not in either set.

// so two `infer T` in a chain of conditionals are siblings and never see each other. Our binder
// puts each on the conditional type it belongs to, and a chained conditional nests inside its
// parent's false branch BY RANGE, so the general containment search finds the outer one and would
// report a shadow upstream is silent about.
//
// # The narrowness is measured, not assumed
//
// The obvious repair is to exempt `infer` from shadowing altogether, and it is wrong. Driven
// against the installed rule at 8.67.0, an `infer` DOES report when what it shadows is an ordinary
// outer type:
//
//	type T = string; type A<F> = F extends (a: infer T) => any ? T : never;   REPORTS
//	type A<T> = T extends (a: infer T) => any ? T : never;                    REPORTS
//	type A<F> = F extends (a: Array<infer T>) => any ? T[] : F extends (...a: infer T) => any ? T : never;   clean
//
// So the exemption is specifically infer-over-infer, and both sides are tested. A blanket exemption
// would silence the first two, which no imported fixture would catch because upstream's default
// corpus writes only the third.

// already handled upstream of here by the type-versus-value carve-out rather than by this test.
