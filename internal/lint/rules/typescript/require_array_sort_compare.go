// `Array#sort` with no comparator converts every element to a string and compares code units, so
// `[1, 10, 2].sort()` yields `[1, 10, 2]` rather than `[1, 2, 10]`. That is almost never what the
// author meant for anything but strings, and it is silent: the result is a plausible-looking array
// in the wrong order.
//
// The rule ships no fixer, and upstream has no `meta.fixable`, because there is no comparator the
// rule could write. Whether the intended order is ascending, descending, or by some field is the
// author's judgment, and the corpus carries no `output` on any of its seventeen failing cases.
//
// # What decides a finding
//
// The anchor is a call with EXACTLY ZERO ARGUMENTS whose callee is a member access. Upstream writes
// that as the selector `CallExpression[arguments.length=0] > MemberExpression`, so the argument
// count is part of the match rather than a test inside the body. `a.sort(undefined)` is silent even
// though it behaves identically at run time, which is upstream's decision and is reproduced: it
// appears in the corpus as a PASSING case, so an explicit `undefined` reads as the author having
// considered the question.
//
// The member name must be `sort` or `toSorted`, and then the RECEIVER's type is resolved through
// `GetConstrainedTypeAtLocation`, which walks a type parameter to its base constraint. The finding
// requires that type to be an array or a union of nothing but arrays. So `any` is silent, a
// user-defined `sort()` on an interface is silent, and a `string[] | number[]` reports while a
// `number[] | string` does not.
//
// The string-array exemption is checked BEFORE the array test, and it asks a narrower question than
// the report does: it requires the receiver to be an array or a TUPLE, then that every type argument
// is a string. A tuple's type arguments are its element types, so `['a', 'b'] as const` is exempt
// while `['a', 1]` is not.
//
// # The member name, and a substrate difference stated rather than papered over
//
// Upstream resolves the member name through `getStaticMemberAccessValue`, which reads a plain
// identifier directly but falls back to ESLint's `getStaticValue` over the enclosing SCOPE for a
// computed key. That means `const key = 'sort'; a[key]()` resolves to `sort` upstream and reports.
//
// This port reads a plain property access and a string-literal computed access, and does NOT
// constant-fold a computed key through a variable, because that requires the scope-analysis and
// constant-folding layer upstream gets from ESLint and this tree does not have. The gap is one
// shape wide and it is a FALSE NEGATIVE, which is the safe direction for a rule with no fixer.
//
// Measured rather than assumed, on the installed build, with a control alongside:
//
//	a['sort']()                        REPORT upstream, REPORT here   string-literal key
//	a?.['sort']()                      REPORT upstream, REPORT here   optional computed
//	const key = 'sort'; a[key]()       REPORT upstream, SILENT here   the divergence
//
// Upstream's corpus writes no computed access at all, so nothing in it can see any of these. The
// gap is recorded here so the next reader does not read the narrowness as deliberate and stop
// checking, and a fixture in this package pins the divergence as reporting-nothing rather than
// leaving it undocumented.
//
// # Cost
//
// A call expression is a common anchor, so the body exits on the argument count before touching the
// checker. The type is resolved only for a zero-argument call to something named `sort` or
// `toSorted`, which is rare.
