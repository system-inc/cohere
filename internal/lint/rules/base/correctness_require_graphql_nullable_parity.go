// that pair. Enforcing parity there would demand the schema lie about the contract.

// GraphQlNullableParity holds a GraphQL decorator's `nullable` flag to the type it decorates.
//
//	valid:   @GraphQlField({ nullable: true })  name?: string;
//	valid:   @GraphQlField({ nullable: false }) name: string;
//	invalid: @GraphQlField({ nullable: true })  name: string;
//	invalid: @GraphQlField({ nullable: false }) name?: string;
//
// The decorator generates the schema and the type generates the code, and nothing makes them agree.
// When they drift, a field the schema promises is non-null starts returning null to clients that
// were told it could not, or a field clients could have relied on is announced as optional forever.
// Both are silent: each side compiles and each side is internally consistent.
//
// # What counts as nullable is wider than null and undefined
//
// `decorators.IsNullableType` also admits `any`, `unknown` and `void`, and that width is the
// judgment rather than a convenience. A decorator saying `nullable: false` beside a value typed
// `any` is a claim nothing checked, so the rule treats it as unmet rather than satisfied. Shared
// with the other three parity rules, which ask the same question about a different flag name.
//
// # An absent flag means false, and a non-boolean flag means skip
//
// Three outcomes rather than two, and the difference decides real cases. A decorator with no
// `nullable` key is checked AS `nullable: false`, so `@GraphQlField() name?: string` reports: the
// schema defaults to non-null and the type is optional. A decorator whose `nullable` is not a
// boolean literal is skipped entirely, which is what makes `nullable: 'items'` and
// `nullable: 'itemsAndList'` out of scope: those declare list-element nullability, a different
// question this rule cannot answer from the element type alone.
//
// # Where the type comes from differs by decorator, and the method arm is easy to miss
//
// An argument decorator reads its parameter's type. A field decorator on a property reads the
// property's. A field decorator on a METHOD reads the method's call-signature return type, because
// the underlying field decorator is valid on a getter or a method as well as a property, and a port
// handling only the property shape goes silent on every computed field. The three operation
// decorators always read a return type.
//
// A GETTER is reached and then declines, in both implementations, because a getter has no call
// signature to read a return type from. That is measured rather than assumed and it is recorded at
// the arm.
//
// A method return is unwrapped through `Promise<T>` once before the check. Once rather than
// recursively: this rule asks whether the resolved value can be absent, and `Promise<Promise<T>>` is
// not a shape anybody writes. That is the original's `unwrapPromise` rather than the recursive
// `unwrapToElementType` its sibling rule uses, and the two are deliberately different.
//
// # A nullable input must admit null itself, not just undefined
//
//	invalid: @GraphQlInputType() class I { @GraphQlField({ nullable: true }) name?: string; }
//	valid:   @GraphQlInputType() class I { @GraphQlField({ nullable: true }) name?: string | null; }
//
// On an input, `nullable: true` means a client may send an explicit null, and the value arrives as
// null. A type of `T | undefined` passes the parity check above, since undefined counts as nullable,
// and then tells every reader the null cannot happen: a `!== undefined` guard lets the client's null
// into whatever is downstream. So on the two input positions, an argument's parameter and a field of
// a `@GraphQlInputType` class, the type must admit null specifically.
//
// Outputs stay out, ruled by system_cohere (#twm9k22): a resolver returning undefined serializes as
// null, so `?: T` on an object type's field says nothing false about the wire, and requiring `| null`
// there would be style rather than a bug.
//
// # The report points at the name, not the decorator
//
// A property or method reports on its key and a parameter reports on itself, which is what the
// original does. The finding is about the declaration's nullability, so the name is where a reader
// looks to fix it.
//
// # No repair
//
// The original ships none. Both ways to satisfy the rule change behaviour: editing the flag changes
// the schema clients see, editing the type changes the code. Which is right is not recoverable from
// the source.
