// ConsistencyNoConsole flags every `console.*` access in source.
//
//	valid:   myConsole.log('x');
//	valid:   window.console.log('x');
//	valid:   console;
//	invalid: console.log('x');
//	invalid: const log = console.log;
//	invalid: foo(console.error);
//	invalid: console['log']('x');
//
// This is one of Kirk's own base rules rather than an upstream port, so the source in
// `api-phi-health/libraries/base/code-quality/lint/rules/ConsistencyNoConsoleRule.ts` is the specification and
// there is no imported corpus. Its reasoning is worth carrying rather than restating: a log line is
// an ingested artifact, competing for the 256 KB trace budget per invocation on exactly the request
// that failed, and walked by the consumer in every batch. The narrow version of this rule rots on
// contact, because "use the logger for errors, console.log is fine for debugging" collapses the
// first time somebody debugs an error.
//
// # The anchor is a member ACCESS, not a call, and that is the whole design
//
// Upstream registers a `MemberExpression` visitor rather than a `CallExpression` one, with a comment
// saying why: the aliasing routes are the point. `const log = console.log` and passing
// `console.error` as a callback both escape a call-shaped check while reporting themselves clean,
// which is worse than not having the rule.
//
// So this anchors on property and element access rather than on the call, and the corresponding
// spellings all report:
//
//	console.log('x')       reports, method log
//	const log = console.log   reports, method log
//	foo(console.error)     reports, method error
//	console['log']('x')    reports, method log (a literal key takes the fallback)
//
// Measured against the real rule driven over the eslint interface, not inferred from the source.
//
// # What is deliberately silent
//
// The receiver must be the bare identifier `console`. `window.console.log('x')` is silent, because
// the object of the outer access is `window.console` rather than `console`, and `myConsole.log` is
// silent for the obvious reason. A bare `console;` with no member access is silent too, since there
// is no member expression at all. All three measured.
//
// That receiver test is upstream's `node.object.type !== 'Identifier' || node.object.name !==
// 'console'`, reproduced exactly. It means a shadowed local named `console` still reports, which is
// upstream's behaviour: the rule reads a name rather than resolving a binding, so it needs no type
// checker and cannot be defeated by a local that happens to be called console.
//
// # The method name, and the fallback that is easy to miss
//
// The message interpolates the accessed member. Upstream reads it as
// `node.property.type === 'Identifier' ? node.property.name : 'log'`, and the subtlety is that
// estree's `property` is whatever expression sits in the brackets rather than a marker of
// computedness. So the fallback fires on the KEY'S KIND, not on the access being computed:
//
//	console.error       renders console.error
//	console[key]        renders console.key       an Identifier property
//	console['error']    renders console.log       a Literal property, so the fallback
//
// That middle row is the one that reads wrong from the source and is right in fact. It was written
// the other way here first, and only the fixture measured against the real rule caught it. A port
// that helpfully read the string literal would diverge on a message nobody would think to check.
//
// # No repair
//
// Upstream ships no fixer and says why: replacing a console call means naming what failed, which is
// the judgment the whole design is asking for and the one thing a rule cannot do.
//
// # Cost
//
// Two common anchors, both exiting on a single identifier comparison. No checker, no program.
