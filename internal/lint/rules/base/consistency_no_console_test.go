// TestNoConsoleReportsAnyBindingNamedConsole pins the name-shaped behaviour.
//
// The rule tests a NAME rather than resolving a binding, which is what keeps it free of the type
// checker. The consequence is that a local, an import or a parameter called `console` reports even
// though it shadows the global and is not the global at all:
//
//	const console = { log(){} }; console.log('x')      REPORTS
//	import { console } from './shim'; console.log('x') REPORTS
//	function f(console: {...}) { console.log('x') }    REPORTS
//	const o = { console: {...} }; o.console.log('x')   clean, the receiver is o.console
//	class A { console = {...}; this.console.log('x') } clean, the receiver is this
//
// All five measured against the real rule, which agrees on all five. So this is fidelity rather than
// a defect, and it is pinned here because it looks exactly like a defect: a reader meeting the first
// three rows will reasonably want to "fix" them by resolving the binding, which would change what
// the rule is and make it need a checker.
//
// The sibling rule `no-global-container` has the same shape and the same behaviour, found the same
// way. It is a property of every base rule that keys on an identifier's spelling.

// all seven. `rule_testing.Run` never consults `internal/suppression`, so a rule test cannot
// reproduce a case that is clean only because of a disable comment.
//
