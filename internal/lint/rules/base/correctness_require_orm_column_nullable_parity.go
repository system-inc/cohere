// This is one of Kirk's own base rules rather than an upstream port, so
// `api-phi-health/libraries/base/code-quality/lint/rules/CorrectnessRequireOrmColumnNullableParityRule.ts` is the
// specification and there is no corpus to import. Its reasoning: a row loaded with a `NULL` hands
// back `null` typed as a non-null value, and the TypeError happens later, somewhere else.
//
// # One direction only, and the other one is deliberate
//
// Column-nullable against type-not-nullable reports. The opposite, a type admitting null against a
// non-nullable column, is permitted, because the pre-insert pattern needs it: `id?: string` for a
// generated key, properties a lifecycle hook fills in. That asymmetry is upstream's and it is the
// difference between this rule and its serializable sibling, which checks both directions.
//
// # What makes a type nullable here
//
// `decorators.IsNullableType`, shared with the other three parity rules rather than re-derived. It
// admits null, undefined, any, unknown and void, recursing through unions. The top types are
// included on purpose: `nullable: false` beside a value typed `any` is a claim nothing checked, so
// the parity rules treat it as unmet rather than as satisfied.
//
// Measured against the real rule, including the rows that read as surprising:
//
//	x?: string                 clean, the question mark makes the type nullable
//	x!: any                    clean, any admits null
//	x!: unknown                clean, same
//	nullable: 'items'          clean, a non-boolean option is not this rule's question
//	["computed"]!: string      clean, the key must be a plain identifier
//	accessor x: string = 'a'   REPORTS, an accessor property is checked like a field
//
// # Cost
//
// Anchored on a decorator, which is rare, and the checker is consulted only after the decorator name
// and its `nullable: true` option have both matched.
