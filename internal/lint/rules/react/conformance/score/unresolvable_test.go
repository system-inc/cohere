// TestUnresolvableTypesIsEarnedNotAssumed probes the excuse rather than trusting it.

// `VerdictUnresolvableTypes` says a type-aware rule read `any` because the fixture never imports
// react. That is a claim about a MECHANISM, and the danger the category carries is that it is also
// what a simply-broken rule looks like. So this supplies the missing types — a local `react.d.ts`
// declaring the hooks the fixture calls — and requires the rule's answer to CHANGE.
//
// A fixture that stays silent with types present was never excused by their absence, and its
// verdict is an excuse rather than a measurement.
