package react_conformance_score

// This file is the rule engine the conformance harness was missing.
//
// `internal/react_conformance` could decide which fixtures a shipped rule is RESPONSIBLE for, and
// then reported every one of them as `not scored: no rule engine run`. That category was honest and
// it was the whole gap: a taxonomy that had never once asked a rule a question. This file supplies
// the missing input — fixture in, real rule over a real type graph, `{heading, message, line}` out
// — so that `Classify` has something to classify.
//
// # The join, and why it is by message id rather than by text
//
// cohere's diagnostic text was written for cohere's users and does not match React's prose, nor
// should it. So a finding is joined to the golden through the rule's own message id, which is the
// same join upstream's `RustBackendComparison-test.ts` makes between two backends. `Rules` below
// is that table, and every entry was checked against a message some golden in this corpus actually
// contains — `TestUpstreamMessageJoinIsNotByResemblance` fails an entry that was not.
//
// An id absent from the table reports NOTHING rather than being mapped by resemblance. That is
// deliberate and it costs recall: a rule can find the right thing under an id nobody joined and
// score as silent. The alternative is worse, because a wrong join produces a specific, confident,
// wrong failure, and this harness exists to stop exactly that.
//
// # What this file deliberately does not do: gate on the fixture's pragma
//
// The obvious design is to run a rule only when the fixture carries the pragma that turns its
// validator on, and it is wrong here. Measured two ways.
//
// From React's own executable (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks/cjs/...development.js`, the unminified
// bundle, at the schema around line 31614) the validators split by default:
//
//	validateNoSetStateInRender      z.boolean().default(true)    pragma is REDUNDANT
//	validateRefAccessDuringRender   z.boolean().default(true)    pragma is REDUNDANT
//	validateNoImpureFunctionsInRender      default(false)        pragma ENABLES
//	validateNoJSXInTryStatements           default(false)        pragma ENABLES
//	validateNoFreezingKnownMutableFunctions default(false)       pragma ENABLES
//
// And from the corpus, cross-tabulating the pragma against the attributed rule: 2 of the 11
// `set-state-in-render` fixtures carry no `@validateNoSetStateInRender`, and 20 of the 38 `refs`
// fixtures carry no `@validateRefAccessDuringRender`. Gating on the pragma would have silenced
// those 22 and scored the silence as correct, because their validator is on by default and the
// pragma is a restatement.
//
// The sharpest case is `incompatible-library`: all three of its fixtures LACK
// `@validateBlocklistedImports`, and the single fixture that carries it attributes to a different
// rule entirely. A pragma gate there scores zero fixtures and reads as a clean run.
//
// So: no gating, for the six rules wired here, none of which is an opt-in validator. If an opt-in
// validator is ever wired (`purity` via `@validateNoImpureFunctionsInRender`, `error-boundaries`
// via `@validateNoJSXInTryStatements`, `immutability` via
// `@validateNoFreezingKnownMutableFunctions`) the gate becomes load-bearing, because upstream
// recorded those goldens with the validator OFF unless the pragma turned it on. Those three are
// the reason this paragraph is here rather than a bare "pragmas do not matter".

// # The `hooks` result, and why 25 of 57 fail
//
// Measured 2026-08-24: `rules-of-hooks` scores 32 passed and 25 failed against React's own Hooks
// goldens. Those 25 are the deliverable of this wiring rather than a problem with it, and they
// partition cleanly into four causes, every one hand-checked against the golden.
//
// The root cause of the first three is one fact stated in the rule's own doc comment: cohere's
// `rules-of-hooks` is a port of **ESLint's** `rules-of-hooks`, whose subject is where a hook CALL
// sits in the control-flow graph. React's `Hooks` ERROR CATEGORY is emitted by the COMPILER, which
// runs a wider analysis over its own intermediate representation. The two share a name and a
// message vocabulary and are not the same validator, so a fixture can be a true Hooks violation
// upstream and outside the ported rule's subject entirely.
//
//	9  hook referenced as a VALUE rather than called
//	   `const x = useState;`, `<Child foo={useFoo} />`, a hook in a ternary or a conditional test.
//	   ESLint's rule never looks at a bare reference; the compiler reports it because lowering has
//	   to place the value somewhere. Wholly outside the ported rule's subject.
//	   error.invalid-assign-hook-to-local.js, error.invalid-pass-hook-as-prop.js,
//	   error.invalid-pass-hook-as-call-arg.js, error.propertyload-hook.js,
//	   error.hook-property-load-local-hook.js, error.invalid-ternary-with-hook-values.js,
//	   rules-of-hooks/error.invalid-call-phi-possibly-hook.js,
//	   rules-of-hooks/error.invalid-hook-as-conditional-test.js,
//	   rules-of-hooks/error.invalid-hook-reassigned-in-conditional.js
//
//	8  a conditional call the ported rule cannot SEE as a hook call
//	   Two shapes. An optional call — `useConditionalHook?.()` — and a hook reached through an
//	   ALIAS, either an aliased import (`import {useState as state}`) or a property of a local. The
//	   ported rule decides hook-ness from the callee's spelling, deliberately and for fidelity
//	   (`rules_of_hooks.go` records that it answers nothing by resolution because oxc reads the
//	   syntactic parent and never resolves). `state()` is not spelled like a hook, so nothing fires.
//	   The compiler resolves through the module graph and knows it is `useState`.
//
//	4  hook identity not stable across renders
//	   `const useMedia = useVideoPlayer(); useMedia();` — a hook obtained from another hook's return
//	   value or from a prop. Upstream's message is "must be the same function on every render", an
//	   inter-procedural value-tracking judgment. ESLint's rule has no counterpart.
//
//	3  the violation IS found, under a different one of React's four Hooks messages
//	   The only category here that is about this join rather than about scope. React chooses between
//	   "called conditionally" and "called within function expressions" by the nature of the
//	   ENCLOSING function; cohere reports the innermost violation it sees. Measured, upstream is not
//	   self-consistent by shape either: `normalFunctionWithConditionalHook` (a conditional hook in a
//	   plain function) gets the CONDITIONAL message, while the same conditional hook inside a
//	   returned function expression gets the NESTED-FUNCTION one, twice. Both implementations report
//	   at the same line and both are right that the code is wrong; they disagree on which sentence
//	   describes it.
//	   rules-of-hooks/error.invalid-rules-of-hooks-d740d54e9c21.js,
//	   rules-of-hooks/error.invalid.invalid-rules-of-hooks-0a1dbff27ba0.js,
//	   rules-of-hooks/error.invalid.invalid-rules-of-hooks-d842d36db450.js
//
//	1  a COUNT difference, same family as the three above
//	   rules-of-hooks/error.invalid.invalid-rules-of-hooks-0de1224ce64b.js: a hook inside a
//	   `useEffect` callback inside a returned function expression. The golden expects the
//	   nested-function message TWICE and cohere reports it once, because React reports the inner
//	   hook AND the enclosing function expression while cohere reports the innermost violation only.
//	   Read as a possible defect first and reclassified after reading the golden: the disagreement
//	   is how many findings one nesting produces, not whether the code is wrong.
//
// These are recorded here, in prose, rather than moved into `statedDivergences`. The distinction is
// deliberate and it is the same one `verdict.go` draws: a stated divergence is a boundary somebody
// DECIDED and a test holds in place, whereas these 25 are an unclosed gap between two validators
// that share a name. Parking them in the excluded column would turn a real 32-of-57 into a
// decorative 32-of-32, which is exactly the pressure `verdict.go` warns that a scoring harness
// creates. They should stay failures until somebody decides to widen the rule or to state the
// boundary formally.

// The three Hooks messages the corpus uses, spelled once because they are long and because a typo
// in one copy of a 200-character literal is invisible in review.
//
// Upstream emits four distinct Hooks messages and cohere's rule carries nine message ids, so the
// join is many-to-one in both directions. That asymmetry is real rather than a modelling shortcut:
// React's `Hooks` category makes one distinction (called conditionally / referenced as a value /
// called somewhere that is not a component body / not stable across renders) where cohere's rule
// makes nine, because cohere's messages were written to tell a developer which shape they wrote.
