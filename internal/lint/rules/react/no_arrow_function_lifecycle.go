//
// A string-literal key is a readable name upstream, since its `key.value` is the string. Both

// guard: a computed key parses as `KindComputedPropertyName`, which is in neither arm. The flag was
// removed rather than kept, because no input can distinguish the two versions.
//
// The omission is also crash protection, which is the half a survival verdict cannot see.
// `Text()` panics on a `ComputedPropertyName` rather than returning anything, and the walk recovers
// per FILE, so calling it would cost every rule in the package every finding in that file. Probed

//
// All 73 corpus cases were replayed against the installed build, version 7.37.5, through the ESLint
// Linter API before any code was written, and it agreed on 72. The one disagreement is a harness
// artifact rather than a rule difference: upstream's `valid 36` writes a TypeScript type annotation
// and the default parser cannot parse it, so the run reported a parse error rather than a verdict.
// Our parser reads it, and it is carried as a fixture at the clean verdict its corpus states.
//
// # Component detection is narrower than the shelf helper
//
// The ES5 factory is `createReactClass` and nothing else, which the rule-local predicate above
// reproduces. `react.IsEs5ComponentCall` also accepts `createClass`, and using it would report on
// two shapes the installed build calls clean. Measured both ways.
//
// The ES6 side uses `react.IsEs6ComponentClass`, which agrees with upstream on every shape the
// corpus and the probes write. Its documented parenthesis skip is not a divergence here:
// `class H extends (React.Component)` REPORTS on the installed build, so skipping is what
// reproduces upstream rather than what improves on it. Measured.
//
// # The static and instance lists are separate, and the split inverts two verdicts
//
// A static class field is checked against the static list alone and an instance field against the
// instance list alone, so:
//
//	static getDerivedStateFromProps = () => {}   REPORTS
//	getDerivedStateFromProps = () => {}          CLEAN, not on the instance list
//	static render = () => {}                     CLEAN, not on the static list
//	render = () => {}                            REPORTS
//
// All four measured. Upstream's corpus writes only the reporting halves, so a port that used one
// combined list would pass every imported case and report two shapes upstream ignores.
//
// An ES5 object property is never static in this sense, so it always uses the instance list. That
// is why `createReactClass({getDerivedStateFromProps: () => {}})` is CLEAN while the class field of
// the same name reports. Measured.
//
// # This port declines the fix on parameters upstream renders wrongly
//
// Upstream's fixer builds the parameter list by mapping each parameter to `p.name`, which is
// undefined for anything that is not a plain identifier, so a destructured or defaulted parameter
// is written into the repaired source as the literal text `undefined`. That is a defect that
// silently deletes what the parameter said, and applying it unattended would corrupt the file.
//
// This port reports those cases and declines to repair them, which is the subset that can be shown
// correct. Reporting without a fix is recoverable; a wrong fix applied unattended is not. The
// decline also covers a typed parameter, which upstream's corpus cannot contain and which our tree
// is full of: rendering `properties: Properties` as `properties` would drop the annotation exactly
// the way the brief's `no-undef-init` incident dropped one.
//
// # The concise-body repair, and what it has to preserve
//
// An arrow with an expression body becomes a block returning that expression, and the comments on
// either side of the expression have to survive into the block. Upstream widens the replaced range
// to cover them, and adds one character when the body is an object literal to account for the
// wrapping parenthesis. Both behaviours are reproduced, and both are asserted by upstream's own
// output vectors.
