// TestUnsupportedSyntaxPointsAtTheRightNode asserts where each of the three findings lands.

// `ExpectFindings` asserts message ids and count and nothing else, so a rule reporting the correct
// finding at the wrong node passes a complete fixture pair while being wrong. That is not
// hypothetical here: a mutation reporting the `with` statement's object expression instead of the
// statement survived the entire suite until this test existed, because every case covering `with`
// asserted only that a finding appeared.
//
// The expected text on each row is a literal typed here rather than anything read off the rule, so
// a mutation moving both the rule and its constant together cannot stay green.
//
// The three spans reproduce upstream exactly. React's own golden for the eval case draws four
// carets under `eval`, and running React's rule on the other two reports columns 3 through 18 for
// `with (props) {}` and 3 through 15 for `class Foo {}`, which are the two spans below.
