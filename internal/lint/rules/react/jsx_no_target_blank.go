	// `{"links": false}` must decode here rather than error, and it must not silence anything, which

// Ported from `react/jsx-no-target-blank` in `eslint-plugin-react`, which is the implementation
// that defined this rule. All 113 imported corpus cases were run against the installed build,
// version 7.37.5, through the ESLint Linter API before any code was written, and it agreed with the
// corpus on every one of them, counts and message ids alike. Everything below that the corpus does
// not state was measured the same way, on inputs written for the question.
//
// # The link and form components, which our config cannot name
//
// `linkComponentsUtil` starts from `['a']` and `['form']` and concatenates
// `settings.linkComponents` / `settings.formComponents`, each of which may be a bare name or a
// `{name, linkAttribute}` pair naming a different attribute to read. Our `internal/config` has no
// settings surface, established in `no_string_refs.go` with a control grep, so neither list can be
// extended here by any route.
//
// The faithful reading is the unconfigured answer rather than a guess at what a project might
// configure. Five corpus cases carry `linkComponents` settings and all five were re-run with the
// settings removed: every one goes CLEAN, because `<Link>` is not a link component by default.
// Those five are recorded as clean fixtures with the reasoning at the line.
//
// So the components here are `a` and `form`, and their attributes are `href` and `action`.
//
// # `links: false` does nothing, and that is upstream's defect reproduced
//
// The schema declares `links` with `default: true`, the rule's `Object.assign` sets it, and
// `configuration.links` is then read NOWHERE in the rule body. Grepped: the only `configuration.`
// reads in the body are `configuration.forms`. Measured on the installed build, three ways:
//
//	{links: false}   <a target="_blank" href="http://x.com"></a>   REPORTS
//	{links: true}    same input                                    reports
//	no options       same input                                    reports
//
// Reproduced rather than fixed. A port that wired it up would silence a whole class of finding on
// any project that wrote `links: false` expecting it to be inert, and no imported fixture could see
// the difference because the corpus writes `links: false` only alongside `forms: true` and asserts
// the FORM finding. That pairing is exactly the shape that makes a wrong belief invisible.
//
// # Which attribute wins when one is written twice
//
// Every lookup is `findLastIndex`, so the LAST `target`, the LAST `href` and the LAST `rel` decide.
// This is not a detail: `<a target="_self" target="_blank" href="http://x.com">` reports and
// `<a target="_blank" href="http://x.com" href="/rel">` is clean, both measured, and a port using a
// first-match search would answer the opposite on both.
//
// # What counts as an external link
//
// `hasExternalLink` accepts a literal href matching `/^(?:\w+:|\/\/)/`, so a scheme or a
// protocol-relative prefix. That makes `mailto:a@b.c` external, measured, which reads as
// over-broad and is upstream's judgment. `enforceDynamicLinks` adds `href={anything}` on top, and
// its absent value is `always`.
//
// # What counts as a secure rel, and the conditional-pairing rule inside it
//
// `hasSecureRel` reads the last `rel` and reduces its value to a list of strings, then requires
// EVERY one of them to contain `noreferrer` (or `noopener` under `allowReferrer`). Three value
// shapes reach it and the third is where the real work is:
//
//	rel="noopener noreferrer"       a literal, split on spaces, lowercased
//	rel={`noreferrer`}              a template literal, and ONLY its first quasi is read, so
//	                                `rel={`${x} noreferrer`}` REPORTS. Measured.
//	rel={c ? 'noreferrer' : 'x'}    a conditional, and which branch is read depends on the TARGET
//
// That last one is the subtle part and it is measured in four directions. When the `rel` is a
// conditional AND the `target` is a conditional AND both tests are the same plain identifier,
// upstream pairs the branches: it finds which of the target's two branches is `_blank` and reads
// the rel branch at the SAME index. So:
//
//	target={c ? '_blank' : '_self'} rel={c ? 'noreferrer' : 'x'}   clean, branches pair up
//	target={c ? '_self' : '_blank'} rel={c ? 'x' : 'noreferrer'}   clean, same pairing inverted
//	target={c ? '_blank' : '_self'} rel={c ? 'x' : 'noreferrer'}   REPORTS, wrong branch is secure
//	target={c ? '_blank' : '_self'} rel={d ? 'noreferrer' : 'x'}   REPORTS, tests differ so BOTH
//	                                                               branches must be secure
//
// When the tests differ, or the target is not a conditional, both rel branches are returned and the
// `every` requires both to be secure, which is the fourth row. All four measured.
//
// # The fixer, and the one arm that has none
//
// `meta.fixable` is `"code"` and the fixer has four arms plus two declines, and the corpus asserts
// 28 rewritten outputs. Every arm below was confirmed by reading the fix ranges the installed build
// emits rather than by reading the source alone:
//
//	no rel at all       insert ` rel="noreferrer"` after the LAST attribute
//	rel with no value   insert `="noreferrer"` after the rel attribute
//	rel="..."           replace the whole string literal with the old parts plus noreferrer
//	rel={"..."}         replace the inner literal the same way
//	rel={5}, rel={null} replace the WHOLE container with `"noreferrer"`, not the inner expression
//
// And two declines, both returning null upstream so no fix is offered:
//
//	target written before a spread          `targetIndex < spreadAttributeIndex`
//	a spread present and no rel attribute   the insertion point cannot be trusted
//
// **The form arm ships no fixer at all.** Its report call has no `fix` property, where the link
// arm's does. Measured: `{forms: true}` on `<form target="_blank" action="http://x.com">` reports
// and carries no fix. Reproduced, because a fix invented here would be applied unattended on a
// shape upstream deliberately leaves alone.
//
// The `noreferrer` written by the fixer is `noreferrer` even under `allowReferrer`, EXCEPT in the
// insertion arms, which write `relValue` and therefore write `noopener`. That asymmetry is
// upstream's: `relValue` is computed from the flag and then only the two `insertText` calls use it,
// while all three `replaceText` calls hardcode `noreferrer`. Measured both ways.
