// Ported from `react/no-deprecated` in `eslint-plugin-react`, which is the implementation that
// defined this rule. Every behavior recorded below was measured by driving the installed build,
// version 7.37.5, through the ESLint Linter API on inputs written for the question. All 55 imported
// corpus cases were run through that build first and it agreed with every one of them, so the
// corpus and the oracle are one authority here rather than two.
//
// # The version gate collapses, and that is the whole reason this rule is small
//
// Upstream guards every entry with `testReactVersion(context, '>= ' + since)`. When no React
// version is configured, `getReactVersionFromContext` falls back to `ULTIMATE_LATEST_SEMVER`, the
// literal `999.999.999` at `util/version.js:16`, so every comparison is true and every entry is in
// force. Auto-detection from `node_modules/react` runs only when the configuration says
// `version: "detect"` explicitly; absence does not trigger it.
//
// Our `internal/config` has no settings surface, which `no_string_refs.go` established with a
// control grep, so no React version can reach a rule here by any route. The faithful reading is to
// reproduce the answer upstream gives under this repository's configuration, and that answer is
// that all 29 entries fire. Measured directly: one file writing all 29 deprecated spellings under
// no settings produces 29 findings on the installed build.
//
// So the `since` version survives here only as the number the message prints. It decides nothing.
//
// # The member arm matches SOURCE TEXT, not a resolved path, and that is load-bearing
//
// Upstream's `MemberExpression` listener calls `checkDeprecation(node, getText(context, node))`,
// which is the member expression's own source slice. A map lookup on that string is not the same
// question as "does this expression denote React.renderComponent", and the difference is visible
// in four directions, all measured on the installed build and all silent there:
//
//	React . renderComponent()       spaces inside the member          silent
//	React\n  .renderComponent()     a newline inside the member       silent
//	React/*x*/.renderComponent()    a comment inside the member       silent
//	React['renderComponent']()      the computed spelling             silent
//	React?.renderComponent()        the optional-chain spelling       silent
//
// Every one of those denotes the deprecated API and upstream reports none of them. Reproduced
// rather than improved on: a port that resolved the path instead would start reporting five shapes
// upstream is silent about, and no imported fixture could see it because the corpus writes none of
// them. The source slice is compared verbatim, so our answer moves with upstream's for any
// whitespace or trivia a future file happens to contain.
//
// The nesting consequence is the same mechanism read forward. `React.PropTypes.component` reports
// TWICE, because the listener fires on the outer member and again on the inner `React.PropTypes`,
// and both slices are keys in the map. That is upstream's behavior, measured, and it is why the
// walk here visits every property access rather than only the outermost.
//
// # The pragma, which renames React for the whole file
//
// `pragmaUtil.getFromContext` scans EVERY comment in the file for `@jsx <name>`, takes the part
// before the first dot, and uses it in place of `React`. Four things about it were measured because
// the source leaves each ambiguous:
//
//	/** @jsx Foo */ Foo.renderComponent()      reports as Foo.renderComponent
//	/** @jsx Foo.bar */ Foo.renderComponent()  reports; only the part before the dot is taken
//	// @jsx Foo (a LINE comment)               reports; the scan is not restricted to block comments
//	Foo.renderComponent()\n/** @jsx Foo */     reports; position in the file does not matter
//	/** @jsx Foo */ React.renderComponent()    SILENT; the pragma REPLACES React rather than adding
//
// The last is the one a port is most likely to get wrong in the safe-looking direction, and it is
// the reason the table below is built per file rather than being a package-level constant.
//
// The settings-based pragma (`settings.react.pragma`) is unreachable here for the same reason the
// version is, so the comment scan is the only way the pragma moves.
//
// # The lifecycle arm, and the three ways it declines
//
// `checkLifeCycleMethods` runs only on a node `isES5Component` or `isES6Component` accepts, and
// then reads `getPropertyName` on each member. That name is `nameNode.name`, which exists on an
// identifier and does not exist on anything else, so two shapes are silent upstream:
//
//	class Foo extends React.Component { ['componentWillMount']() {} }   silent, computed key
//	class Foo extends React.Component { 'componentWillMount'() {} }     silent, string key
//
// Both measured. Neither is in the corpus. A port reading the key's text through a helper that
// cooks a string literal would report both and look more correct while diverging.
//
// What does NOT decline is anything about the member's kind. A getter, a static, and a class field
// holding a non-function all report, measured, so this arm tests the NAME and nothing else.
//
// And the ES5 factory name here is `createReactClass` alone, from `getCreateClassFromContext`'s
// default. `React.createClass({componentWillMount(){}})` therefore reports ONE finding, for the
// member expression `React.createClass`, and not the lifecycle method inside it. Measured; it is
// the case where the two arms most look like they should agree and do not.
//
// # What is deliberately not ported: the JSDoc component
//
// `isES6Component` opens with `isExplicitComponent`, which reads a JSDoc `@extends React.Component`
// or `@augments React.Component` tag through `sourceCode.getJSDocComment`. Four inputs written for
// it are all silent on the installed build:
//
//	/** @extends React.Component */ class F { componentWillMount() {} }   silent
//	/** @augments React.Component */ class F { componentWillMount() {} }  silent
//
// So the branch is not reproduced, and this paragraph records the measurement rather than an
// argument: the command was the same Linter drive every other line here cites, and it reported
// nothing for either tag. If a later reader finds an arrangement where it does fire, this is the
// note that says the absence here was measured on two shapes and not proved over all of them.
