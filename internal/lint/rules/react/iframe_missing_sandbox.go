// whole 45-case corpus was replayed against the installed build (7.37.5) through the ESLint Linter
// API before any code was written, and it agreed on all 45, counts and message ids alike. Every
// behaviour below that the corpus does not state was measured the same way, on inputs written for
// the question.
//
// # There is no file-suffix gate
//
// Three siblings in this package gate on `.tsx`/`.jsx`, which is oxc residue rather than upstream
// behaviour: this rule was ported from the authority, which has no such gate anywhere. A fixture
// writes the same reporting source under `.tsx` and `.ts` and asserts both report. `.jsx` and `.js`
// are not testable here: `rule_testing`'s tsconfig pins `"include": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]`, so a
// JavaScript-suffixed fixture is not in the program at all and the typed harness fails building the
// type graph. That is a limit of the harness rather than of the rule, and `.ts` is the extension
// that separates the gated behaviour from the ungated one anyway.
//
// # The two arms and why the createElement one is narrower than the shelf helper
//
// `internal/utilities/react.IsCreateElementCall` accepts a bare `createElement(...)` with no
// import, accepts `Preact.createElement`, and accepts a computed `React['createElement']`.
// Upstream's `isCreateElement` accepts none of those three. Measured on the installed build, all
// three are silent, and the shelf helper's own doc comment says to check before reaching for it,
// which is the check. This rule uses this package's `isPragmaCreateElementCall` instead, already
// ported against the same authority for `checked-requires-onchange-or-readonly` and shared by four
// rules. That is where the checker declaration comes from: the bare-identifier branch resolves the
// name to a binding the `react` module introduced.
//
// # `sandbox` is matched exactly, and case matters
//
// Upstream compares `attribute.name.name === 'sandbox'`. `<iframe SANDBOX="" />` reports
// `attributeMissing`, measured, so the attribute match is `jsx.MatchExactly` rather than the
// case-insensitive matcher some siblings use. The tag name is matched the same way: `<IFRAME>` is a
// component reference to JSX, not the HTML element, and is silent.
//
// # Presence and readability are two different questions, which is why the shelf value reader is
// not used here
//
// `jsx.StringAttributeValue` returns `("", false)` both for an absent attribute and for one present
// with a non-literal value, and this rule has to tell those apart: `<iframe sandbox={x} />` is
// CLEAN upstream because the attribute is present, while a missing one reports. So the attribute
// loop is written here, setting a found flag on the name alone and validating only when the value
// is a plain string literal.
//
// Three value shapes are present-but-unvalidated and all three are measured clean:
//
//	<iframe sandbox />              no initializer at all
//	<iframe sandbox={""} />         an expression container, even holding a literal
//	<iframe sandbox={`allow-forms`} />   a template literal
//
// The expression-container one is upstream's own corpus case and it is the surprising one: the
// value IS a literal, and upstream still declines it because its `attribute.value.type` is
// `JSXExpressionContainer` rather than `Literal`. Reproduced rather than improved on.
//
// # A spread does not count as supplying the attribute
//
// `<iframe {...props} />` reports `attributeMissing` and `React.createElement("iframe", {...p})`
// does too, both measured. Upstream's loops test the member kind and a spread never matches, so a
// spread that plainly could supply `sandbox` is treated as absent. This is upstream reporting on
// code it cannot see into, and it is reproduced: the alternative silences the rule on any element
// that spreads.
//
// # Which object keys count
//
// The createElement arm reads `x.key.name`, which is defined only on an identifier key, so a
// quoted key declines and the whole call reports as missing:
//
//	React.createElement("iframe", {'sandbox': ''})      reports attributeMissing
//	React.createElement("iframe", {['sandbox']: ''})    reports attributeMissing
//	React.createElement("iframe", {sandbox})           CLEAN
//
// All three measured. The shorthand is the sharp one: it satisfies the name test, so the attribute
// counts as found, and its value is an identifier rather than a literal, so nothing is validated.
// Present and unreadable, exactly like `sandbox={x}` on the JSX side.
//
// An accessor or a method key counts too, and this cost a defect on the way here. The first draft
// filtered on the member kind before the name test, accepting only a property assignment and a
// shorthand, which reads as a faithful spelling of upstream's `x.type === 'Property'`. It is not:
// in ESTree a getter, a setter and a shorthand method are ALL `Property`, differing only in `kind`,
// and every one of them carries `key.name`. Parsed with espree to confirm, and measured on the
// installed build:
//
//	React.createElement("iframe", { get sandbox() { return ""; } })   CLEAN
//	React.createElement("iframe", { set sandbox(v) {} })              CLEAN
//	React.createElement("iframe", { sandbox() { return ""; } })       CLEAN
//
// Our parser gives those three `KindGetAccessor`, `KindSetAccessor` and `KindMethodDeclaration`, so
// the kind filter excluded them and the rule reported `attributeMissing` on all three where
// upstream is silent. No imported fixture could see it, because the corpus writes no accessor
// anywhere, and the mutation that exposed it read as a subsumed guard: deleting the filter changed
// nothing the fixtures asserted. The filter is gone, the name test does the whole job, and three
// fixtures pin it.
//
// # Only the second argument is read
//
//	React.createElement("iframe", {a:1}, {sandbox: ""})    reports, measured
//
// Children are children.
//
// # Truthiness gates validation, and a non-string passes through it
//
// Upstream validates only when `value.value` is truthy AND a string. So `{ sandbox: true }` is
// clean (truthy, not a string, corpus case), and so are `{ sandbox: null }`, `{ sandbox: false }`
// and `{ sandbox: 0 }` (falsy). `{ sandbox: 5 }` is clean on both counts. All measured. Here the
// same gate is a single test that the value is a string literal, plus the empty-string case, which
// is the one shape where truthiness and stringness disagree: `sandbox=""` is a string and falsy, so
// upstream skips validation for it, and skipping validation on the empty string reaches the same
// verdict as validating it, since `""` is in the allowed list. Both routes are clean and the corpus
// asserts it twice.
//
// # The dangerous pair is silent only on a provably cross-origin frame, which is where cohere leaves upstream
//
// Upstream reports `allow-scripts allow-same-origin` on every iframe. The escape it warns about
// needs both tokens AND a framed document in the framing page's own origin, since only then can
// the frame's script reach the parent and strip its own `sandbox`. A cross-origin document gets
// its own origin back from `allow-same-origin`, which is what a YouTube player needs for its own
// storage, and it can reach nothing of ours whatever its tokens. Three real embeds in phi web,
// `HomePagePodcastSection.tsx:46`, `PodcastEpisodePlayer.tsx:71` and `YouTubeEmbed.tsx:23`, all
// `youtube-nocookie.com`, were findings upstream would raise and none of them is a defect.
//
// So the combination is silent only when the frame is PROVABLY cross-origin, and reports on
// everything else, same-origin or unknown, by @system_cohere_lint's ruling of 2026-10-04 (#3rxx2y9):
// a dynamic `src` that resolves same-origin is exactly the case the warning exists for, so silence on
// an unknown origin is the wrong default for a security rule. Provably cross-origin is a `src` whose
// text fixes an origin other than the page's: an `http:` or `https:` URL or a protocol-relative
// `//host` with its host complete, a `data:` URL (an opaque origin matches nothing), or another
// scheme no page is served from. The text is the literal's, a template's head, the initializer of a
// `const` it names, or every string and template literal constituent of its type
// (`iframeMissingSandboxFrame`). A relative `src`, an absent one (`about:blank` inherits the parent),
// an `about:`, `blob:` or `javascript:` URL, and any `srcDoc`, which takes the parent's origin and
// wins over `src`, are same-origin. A plain `string`, a template whose head stops before the host is
// complete, a bare `src` and a spread after the last `src` are unknown. Both report. The
// invalid-token and missing-attribute reports are untouched and remain exactly upstream's.
