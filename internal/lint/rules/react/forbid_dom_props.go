// # The clone and the installed build disagree, and this port follows the installed build
//
// The clone's working tree carries a `disallowedValues` feature and a second message id,
// `propIsForbiddenWithValue`, that the INSTALLED build does not have. Both claim version 7.37.5;
// the clone is the unreleased default branch. Verified two ways: the installed rule file contains
// neither identifier, and replaying upstream's own corpus against the installed build disagrees on
// exactly the three cases that exercise the feature. Upstream's `valid 8` and `valid 10` report,
// and its `invalid 10` reports six findings where the corpus says five.
//
// This port reproduces the INSTALLED build, because that is the artifact our gate compares against
// and the one this repository actually runs. The consequence is that a `disallowedValues` key in a
// configuration is accepted by the schema and ignored, exactly as the installed build ignores it.
// The three corpus cases are carried at the installed build's verdict with the clone's verdict
// named beside each.
//
// # The value is never read, which is the opposite of a sibling rule
//
// `jsx-no-script-url` decides from an attribute's string value and therefore declines a bare prop
// and an expression container. This rule decides from the NAME alone, so `<div id />` and
// `<div id={x} />` both report. Measured on the installed build. Reading the value here would
// silently narrow the rule to string-valued props.
//
// The clone's newer body does read the value, unguarded, which would crash on a bare prop. Not
// reproduced, since the installed build does not have that code at all.
//
// # An empty disallowedFor list matches nothing
//
// Upstream tests the list for truthiness and an empty array is truthy, so it falls through to a
// membership test nothing satisfies. An absent list means every DOM tag; an empty one means none.
// The decoder keeps the two apart with a flag, because Go's zero value cannot. Measured.
//
// # There is no file-suffix gate
//
// Three siblings in this package gate on `.tsx` and `.jsx`, which is oxc residue rather than
// upstream behaviour. This rule is ported from the authority, which has no such gate.
