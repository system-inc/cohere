// file.
//
// The whole 53-case corpus was extracted from upstream's own tester and replayed against the
// installed 7.37.5 build through the ESLint Linter API before any code was written. It agreed with
// the corpus on all 53, counts and message text alike.
//
// # The oracle needed a TypeScript parser, and that is a fact about the harness rather than the rule
//
// 24 of the 53 cases carry upstream's `class fields` or `types` feature flag, and under the plain
// JSX parser every one of them comes back as a fatal parse error, which reads exactly like a clean
// verdict. Driving the oracle with `@typescript-eslint/parser` instead moved it from 29 of 53 to
// 53 of 53 with zero parse failures. Our parser reads TypeScript unconditionally, so those 24 have
// real verdicts here and had to be measured rather than inherited.
//
// # What upstream's algorithm actually is, and why it is not a sort
//
// The name says sort and the implementation is a pairwise vote. For each ORDERED PAIR of members
// upstream asks whether their relative position is defensible, and records a violation against the
// FIRST member of any pair that is not. So a single misplaced member in a class of six can
// accumulate five votes against it, and every other member accumulates one.
//
// The votes are then reconciled twice over, and both reconciliations are load-bearing:
//
//	score    how many pairs a member lost. `storeError` increments it on every failing pair.
//	closest  the losing partner with the smallest index distance, which is what the message names.
//
// `dedupeErrors` then walks the recorded errors and, for each one, looks up the error recorded
// against its own closest partner. Whichever of the two has the higher score survives and the other
// is deleted. That is what turns "render and displayName are in the wrong order" from two findings
// into one, pointed at whichever member is more wrong.
//
// Reproducing this as an actual sort would be simpler and would disagree with upstream on any input
// where three or more members conflict, because a sort has no notion of one member being more at
// fault than another.
//
// # Map iteration order is the one place Go could disagree with itself
//
// Upstream's `errors` is a JavaScript object keyed by index, and both `dedupeErrors` and
// `reportErrors` walk it with `Object.entries`, which for integer-like keys iterates in ASCENDING
// NUMERIC ORDER. Go's map iteration is randomised, and `dedupeErrors` MUTATES the collection it
// walks, so an unordered walk makes the surviving finding depend on which entry was visited first.
//
// That is not a theoretical hazard: with two conflicting members of equal score, the two orders
// delete different entries, so the rule would report a different member run to run. A flaky rule
// reads as green most of the time and blames something unrelated on the run where it does not, so
// the determinism is put in the RULE rather than trusted to a fixture: `sortCompSortedIndexes`
// walks the keys in ascending numeric order at both sites, matching `Object.entries`.
//
// # Two shapes upstream's corpus cannot express, and how they are decided here
//
// `type-annotations` selects a member that carries a type annotation and NO value, which upstream
// spells `!!node.typeAnnotation && node.value === null`. In our AST a property declaration's `Type`
// is a sibling of the name rather than part of it, and `Initializer` is what upstream calls
// `value`, so the predicate is `declaration.Type != nil && declaration.Initializer == nil`. The
// corpus pins it: `props: { text: string };` matches and `state: Object = {};` does not, and the
// case that separates them is invalid[6], where reversing the second half of the test moves the
// finding.
//
// `getters` and `setters` read `node.kind === 'get'` / `'set'`, which are distinct node kinds here
// rather than a discriminant field, so they are matched on `ast.KindGetAccessor` and
// `ast.KindSetAccessor`. An accessor in an OBJECT LITERAL is the same two kinds, which is why the
// factory-component arm reaches them too.

		// available here, subsumed.
