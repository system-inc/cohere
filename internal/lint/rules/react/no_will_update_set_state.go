// the permissive default it spells `allow-in-func` internally. oxc deserializes the same position
// into `AllowedOrDisallowInFunc`, which also names the default explicitly as `allowed`, and this
// rule's corpus writes an empty array in that position on one pass case. Both spellings are
// accepted here and only `disallow-in-func` changes an answer.
//
// Our inventory records this rule as taking no options, which is wrong. That column has now been

// oxlint binary for every shape our abstract syntax tree spells differently than oxc's does.
//
// # What the rule actually decides, which is narrower than its name and wider than it reads
//
// Three conditions, all syntactic. There is no call-graph analysis anywhere in either upstream, and
// that is the thing most likely to be assumed: a helper method that calls `setState`, invoked from
// the lifecycle method, is silent at both tools and is silent here. Only ancestry counts.
//
//	the callee is `this.setState`, by member access of either spelling
//	walking outward reaches a property or method named for the lifecycle, either prefix
//	and continuing outward from there reaches a React component
//
// The nesting judgment sits on top: the walk counts function-like ancestors passed before reaching
// the lifecycle name, and by default declines when that count exceeds one. A call written directly
// in the method body passes one function, which is the method itself. A call in a callback passes
// two. `disallow-in-func` drops the count check and reports at any depth. So `setState` in an `if`
// or a ternary reports, and in a callback or an arrow it does not.
//
// # The two conditions being independent is upstream behavior, and it is the surprise here
//
// Nothing checks that the lifecycle-named property and the component are related. A plain object
// literal carrying a `componentWillUpdate` property, declared anywhere inside any component,
// reports as though it were that component's own lifecycle method. Measured on the release binary
// rather than inferred, because the loop reads as though it were checking a component's method and
// is not: it latches on a name match and then stops at the first component above it, however far
// away and whatever lies between.
//
// The inverse also holds and is the difference from ESLint. ESLint's factory matches the
// lifecycle-named property and stops, so it reports on a class extending nothing and on a bare
// object literal at the top level of a file. oxc requires the component and is silent on both.
// Reproduced oxc's answer, because oxc is what the differential gate compares against, and the
// three clean fixtures covering it are ours rather than upstream's.
//
// # The React version gate is upstream's and is not reachable here, so its default branch is all
//
// oxc reads `settings.react.version` and drops the `UNSAFE_` spelling when the configured version
// predates 16.3, where the prefix was introduced. Our `internal/config` has no settings surface at
// all: `Config` carries `Rules` and `Overrides` and nothing else, checked with a control grep that
// found `rules` in the same command that found no `settings`. So no version can reach a rule here,
// and oxc's own default, `is_none_or(supports_unsafe_lifecycle_prefix)`, answers true. Both names
// are therefore unconditional in this port.
//
// Stating the measurement rather than the reasoning, because this is the shape of divergence claim
// the brief warns inoculates the next reader: with no version configured, an
// `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate` holding a `setState` reports on the release binary; with
// `"settings": {"react": {"version": "16.2.0"}}` in the config, the same source in the same file is
// silent while its unprefixed neighbour still reports. Upstream's sixth pass case is exactly that
// silent one, and it is recorded in the fires test with its reasoning at the line, because the
// configuration that makes it clean cannot be produced here. If a settings surface ever lands, this
// is the rule that wants it and the case is already written.
//
// # Why the ES5 component predicate is spelled here rather than taken from the shelf
//
// `utilsreact.IsEs5ComponentCall` looks like exactly this question and answers a wider one. It
// accepts `createClass` and `React.createClass` as well as `createReactClass`, while
// `is_es5_component`, which is the helper this rule reaches, keys on the single constant
// `createReactClass` at `oxc utils/react.rs:554`. Measured: both of the wider spellings are clean
// on the release binary, so reaching for the shelf would have reported where upstream is silent,
// and no imported fixture covers either spelling so nothing would have caught it. Handled locally
// rather than by narrowing the shelf, because other rules may depend on the wider set.
//
// That is the third time in this package a react helper has been correct for the rule that
// motivated it and wrong for a neighbour asking a question of the same shape. The ES6 half does
// match, and `utilsreact.IsEs6ComponentClass` is used for it rather than copied.
//
// # Reading a property key cannot go through Text()
//
// A computed key is a `ComputedPropertyName` and `Node.Text()` panics on it outright, so the key is
// resolved with `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName`, which checks kind before reading and answers a
// boolean for the keys that name nothing statically. That is the shim's spelling of oxc's
// `static_name()` and it resolves the same three shapes: an identifier, a string literal, and a
// computed key holding one. All three measured reporting on the release binary, so a port matching
// only the identifier spelling loses two real findings and crashes on a third input.
//
// # No source-type gate, and that is a deliberate difference rather than an omission
//
// oxc declares `should_run` returning `ctx.source_type().is_jsx()`, so the rule is skipped entirely
// on a plain `.ts` file. Nothing in this rule reads a JSX node; the gate is oxc narrowing a react
// plugin to react files. Our harness has no per-rule source-type predicate and the config decides
// which files a rule is offered, so reproducing it would mean inventing a mechanism to answer a
// question our config already answers. The decision the rule makes is unchanged either way: a `.ts`
// file holding `class H extends React.Component` is legal TypeScript and the finding is correct
// there. Stated rather than silent, because it is the one place this port is knowingly wider than
// oxc, and the only inputs it can differ on are ones oxc declines to look at rather than ones it
// judges differently.

// by diffing them: the shared helper returns `Some(count)` at the first component and the inlined
// one sets a flag and breaks, which is the same control flow spelled twice.
//
// The two halves of its answer are what the rule decides on: how many function-like constructs were
// passed before a property named for the lifecycle method was reached, and whether a React component
// was reached after that. The boolean is false when either never happens, which is one return value
// in oxc's `Option<usize>` and two here because Go has no such shape without a pointer.
//
// # Three details that each look like a detail and are not
//
// **Counting stops at the first name match.** Once the lifecycle name is seen, further functions on
// the way out are not counted. A lifecycle-named property nested inside the real lifecycle method
// therefore has a count of one and reports in the default mode, which was measured rather than
// reasoned about because continuing to count would have made it two and silent.
//
// **The count includes the lifecycle method's own function.** A call written directly in the body
// passes exactly one, which is why the threshold is `> 1` rather than `> 0`. That holds across all
// three ways the method can be written: a `MethodDeclaration`, an object property whose value is a
// function expression, and a class property whose value is an arrow. In the last of those, the
// arrow is passed before the property that names it, which is what keeps the three consistent.
//
// **The name is read with the kind-checked resolver.** `ast.TryGetTextOfPropertyName` answers for an
// identifier, a string literal and a computed key holding a literal, and answers false rather than
// panicking on an interpolated computed key. Reading `Text()` here crashes the linter on the first
// `{[k]: v}` in the tree, and `this.setState` itself parses to a `PropertyAccessExpression`, which
// is a second kind that panics.
//
