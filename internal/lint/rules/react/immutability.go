// React re-renders by comparing values, not by observing writes. A value it has already read -- a
// prop, a piece of state, something handed to a hook, something interpolated into JSX -- is
// therefore frozen from that moment: React has taken its answer and will not look again. Writing
// through it afterwards changes what the program sees while leaving what React sees untouched, so
// the interface keeps rendering the old value and only corrects itself when some unrelated update
// happens to schedule a render. The symptom is a control that visibly does nothing until you click
// something else, which reads as a state-management bug rather than as what it is.
//
// # Where this comes from
//
// React's `InferMutationAliasingEffects` and two validators, transcribed by oxc at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_inference/infer_mutation_aliasing_effects.rs` and
// `react_compiler_validation/`. oxc's *linter* rule at `rules/react/immutability.rs` is a four-line
// dispatcher into `run_react_compiler_rule(ctx, ErrorCategory::Immutability)`, so reading only the
// rule file makes a large port look trivial. Six diagnostic sites carry this category: three inside
// the inference pass and three inside the two validators.
//
// # This rule DOES need the abstract interpretation, and that was measured rather than inherited
//
// Three rules shipped onto this representation before this one found their scoping measurement
// overturned, so the claim that this one genuinely needs a value lattice was treated as a
// hypothesis and tested against React's own executable before any of it was written.
//
// The hypothesis holds, and the input that settles it is an ORDERING pair. Both of these compile,
// both mutate the same locally-created object, and they differ only in which statement comes first:
//
//	const o = {a: 0}; useFoo(o); o.a = 1;    REPORTS
//	const o = {a: 0}; o.a = 1; useFoo(o);    CLEAN
//
// So freezing is not a property of where a value came from, and a rule keyed on origin -- "props
// and state are immutable, locals are not" -- gets exactly half of that pair wrong while looking
// entirely reasonable. Freezing is a fact that a value ACQUIRES at a program point and carries
// forward, which is a dataflow fact and nothing cheaper. The same probe run through an alias
// (`const alias = o; useFoo(alias); o.a = 1;`) also reports, so the fact propagates through
// aliasing as well as through order, which rules out a purely per-binding table.
//
// # The lattice, and why its join cannot be an ordering
//
// Six elements: Mutable, Frozen, Primitive, MaybeFrozen, Global, Context. `internal/utilities/hir/
// high_level_intermediate_representation.go` carries a warning written for this rule, and it is correct: the `Effect` constants
// declared beside it look like a lattice and are not one, and a pass whose join is "take the larger
// Effect" would be self-consistent, pass its own tests, and be wrong.
//
// The join here is `immutabilityMergeKinds`, transcribed from upstream's `merge_value_kinds`, and
// the thing that makes it not an ordering is that `Frozen` joined with `Mutable` is `MaybeFrozen`,
// a THIRD element that is neither operand. No ordering of six constants expresses that, so the
// meet cannot be recovered by sorting them differently.
//
// Verified against React's executable rather than transcribed on faith, one probe per join edge,
// each with the compilation gate held constant so the gate could not explain the answer:
//
//	if (c) { x = useHook(); } else { x = {}; }   x.q = 1   REPORTS   Frozen  join Mutable   = MaybeFrozen
//	if (c) { x = {a:1};     } else { x = {}; }   x.q = 1   CLEAN     Mutable join Mutable   = Mutable
//	if (c) { x = useHook(); } else { x = h2;  }  x.q = 1   REPORTS   Frozen  join Frozen    = Frozen
//	if (c) { x = useHook(); } else { x = 3;   }  x.q = 1   REPORTS   Frozen  join Primitive = Frozen
//	if (c) { x = aGlobal;   } else { x = {}; }   x.q = 1   CLEAN     Global  join Mutable   = Mutable
//
// The fifth row is the one worth keeping: joining a global with a local produces something this
// rule is silent on, even though the global ALONE reports. A lattice built by intuition would make
// Global absorbing and would report there.
//
// # Convergence equality is not identity equality
//
// `refs.go` records this hazard from the neighbouring validator and it applies here for a different
// reason, so it is restated rather than cross-referenced. Upstream's abstract value is a kind plus
// a REASON SET, and the reason set only ever grows. If the fixpoint's "did anything move" test
// compared whole abstract values with Go's `==`, a value whose kind had settled but whose reason
// set was still absorbing bits from a back edge would report movement on every round.
//
// `immutabilityStateChanged` therefore compares the KIND for change and treats the reason set as
// monotone bookkeeping: a round counts as having moved only when some value's kind moved or some
// binding gained a new value, never when a reason bit arrived at a value whose kind is already
// final. Reasons still merge -- they select the message text -- they simply do not vote on
// termination. Without that split the sweep runs its full bound on any function with a loop.
//
// The reason set is a bitset rather than a slice for the same reason: two sets that merged the same
// bits in a different order must compare equal, and a slice would not.
//
// # Why a bounded whole-function sweep rather than `control_flow_graph.Solve`
//
// `control_flow_graph.Solve[V,E]` is mechanically unreachable from this representation: `control_flow_graph.
// Block`'s `index`, `final` and `thrown` fields are unexported and set only by `control_flow_graph.Build`,
// so a caller holding a `high_level_intermediate_representation.Function` cannot construct one. `ssa.go`, `postdominator.go` and
// `refs.go` all already record this. That is a mechanical fact and it is not the reason this rule
// does not use it.
//
// The reason is that upstream is not a per-block entry/exit solve either. It is a worklist over
// blocks carrying one `InferenceState` each, and the state is keyed by VALUE identity rather than
// by binding, with an aliasing side map that lets several bindings share one value. Reproduced here
// as a bounded whole-function sweep in reverse postorder, which is the same shape `refs.go` uses
// and which settles an acyclic region in a single round because `Function.Blocks` is already in
// reverse postorder. The bound is ten rounds, matching upstream's own. Measured on Kirk's tree,
// every function settled in at most two rounds; see the test file.
//
// # Phi operands are a Go map, and nothing here may depend on their order
//
// `high_level_intermediate_representation.Phi.Operands` is `map[BlockId]Place`, so ranging it yields a nondeterministic order. A
// sibling rule shipped a message that named a different builtin between runs for exactly this
// reason. The join used here is commutative and associative, so the resulting KIND is
// order-independent by construction; the reason set is a bitset union, which is likewise. The
// message text is selected from the merged reason set by a fixed priority order and never from
// "whichever operand arrived first", so no output of this rule can vary between runs.
//
// # The component gate is the whole rule for a third of the corpus
//
// Twelve of the fifteen imported fixtures that React reports nothing on are silent for one reason:
// the function creates no JSX and calls no hook, so React never compiles it and no validator runs.
// Adding a single hook call to those twelve makes all twelve report. oxc's compiler test harness
// compiles every fixture unconditionally and therefore snapshots findings React's linter does not
// produce, which is a harness difference rather than a rule difference and is recorded here because
// it makes the imported snapshot counts misleading for this rule.
//
// The gate lives in `unsupported_syntax.go` and is reused whole. Its parameter test is load-bearing
// and not obvious: a component may take at most two parameters and a second one must be named for a
// ref, so `function Component(props, cond) { props.a = 1; return <div />; }` is SILENT while the
// same body with one parameter reports. That was measured here independently before the shared
// predicate was found, and an earlier reading of the same evidence produced a confident wrong
// theory that conditional mutation of props was exempt -- every probe supporting it had quietly
// introduced a second parameter. Holding the gate constant and re-running collapsed the theory: with
// arity fixed, conditionality makes no difference to any of the six freeze sources.
//
// # One span where upstream has two
//
// Upstream's diagnostics carry a primary span plus a secondary label pointing at the value's
// origin. Our `Diagnostic` carries a single `Range`, so the primary span is kept where upstream puts
// it and the origin label is dropped rather than folded into the message.
