// Ported from `react/jsx-no-undef`, read against oxc's `jsx_no_undef.rs`. Both of the questions
// this rule's shape turns on were measured rather than reasoned about, because both are places
// where our tree's syntax model differs from the one upstream is written against.
//
// # Where the intrinsic line actually sits, and why the shim cannot tell us
//
// Upstream never asks "is this tag lowercase". It asks the parser, which has already split the tag
// into `JSXElementName::Identifier` for an intrinsic and `JSXElementName::IdentifierReference` for
// a component, and then declines the first variant outright. The whole judgment lives in oxc's
// parser at `crates/oxc_parser/src/jsx/mod.rs:178`.
//
// typescript-go draws no such distinction. Both forms arrive as a plain `ast.KindIdentifier`, so a
// port that anchors on the kind alone has to reproduce that split by hand, and reproducing only the
// obvious half of it means every `<div>` in the tree reports. The predicate is `isComponentName`
// below and it is upstream's, byte for byte in its effect, measured against the release oxlint
// binary on the four shapes a reading of "lowercase means intrinsic" would get wrong: `<_foo />`
// and `<$foo />` report, `<테스트 />` reports because a non-ASCII first byte is always a reference,
// and `<Foo-bar />` stays silent because a dash makes it a custom element whatever its case.
//
// # A member expression's object is a reference at any case
//
// The case test applies only to a bare tag name. `<app.Foo />` and `<appp.Foo />` differ in the
// corpus by whether `app` is declared, not by case, because oxc's parser builds every member
// object as an `IdentifierReference` unconditionally. Applying the case predicate to the leftmost
// object would have made the corpus's `<appp.Foo />` and `<appp.foo.Bar />` fail cases silent, and
// they are two of the eight findings upstream snapshots.
//
// # Why the checker rather than a scope walk
//
// This is name resolution rather than a scope flag, so it is the kind of `ctx.scoping()` question
// that costs the checker. Established by probe rather than by reading the call site: the four
// corpus cases that separate a real port from a plausible one are all resolution questions no
// syntactic walk answers. `enum A { App }` declares `App` as a member and not as a value binding,
// so it reports, while `var App` beside the same enum does not; `import App = require('./app')`
// and `import App = Foo.App` both bind; and `{ const App = null; }` binds only inside its block.
// `GetSymbolAtLocation` returned the right answer on all four.
//
// Resolution alone is not sufficient, which is the other half of why the case predicate is not
// optional: `<img />` and `<x-gif />` resolve to no symbol either, exactly like the undeclared
// components. Nothing in the type graph separates an intrinsic element from a typo.
//
// # Globals, and allowGlobals
//
// Upstream walks the scope chain from the tag outward and, in a module, stops at the module scope
// unless `allowGlobals` is set. So by default a tag naming something only the global scope declares
// reports in a module: a configured global, or a lib declaration such as `<Map />`. ESLint's flat
// config reads every file as a module except a `.cjs` one, which is commonjs and reaches the global
// scope with or without the option. All three measured against the installed build (#d21war2).
//
// The checker answers a wider question than the walk does, since `GetSymbolAtLocation` finds a
// global as readily as a local. So a resolved symbol counts as in scope only when one of its
// declarations is in this file; an import counts, because its symbol is the alias the import
// declares here. Under `allowGlobals`, or in a `.cjs` file, any resolved symbol counts. Before
// #d21war2 every resolved symbol counted, which was `allowGlobals` on in every file.

// resolvableJsxReference returns the identifier a JSX tag name asks scope to resolve, or nil when

// Three shapes decline, matching the three variants upstream's `get_resolvable_ident` returns
// `None` for:
//
//   - an intrinsic or custom element, which is `KindIdentifier` failing `isComponentName`
//   - a namespaced name, which typescript-go gives its own kind, so no text inspection is needed
//   - anything rooted at `this`, which resolves to the enclosing class rather than to a binding
//
// The `this` case is declined structurally rather than by resolution, and that is deliberate:
// probed, `<this.props.tag />` inside a class resolves to the class's own symbol and would have
// passed anyway. Leaning on that would have made the rule's agreement with upstream accidental,
// dependent on the element sitting inside a class, and `<this.foo />` at the top level of a module
// resolves to nothing and would then have reported where upstream is silent.
// A nil tagName needs no arm of its own. `jsx.ElementParts` returns nil only for a node that is
// neither JSX opening form, which the two listeners above never hand it, and a JSX element the
// parser produced always carries a tag name: typescript-go's own parser dereferences `TagName()`
// unguarded on both forms. Written first as an explicit `tagName == nil` guard, which a mutation
// sweep then showed no fixture could reach, because nothing can construct the input. It is subsumed
// by the switch rather than deleted, since a nil node matches no arm and falls to the final return.
