//
// # This rule is a filter over a detection pass that already exists in this package

// Upstream is `Components.detect(...)`, which merges its own detection visitors ahead of the rule's
// and hands the rule a populated component registry. Every finding comes from asking whether a node
// is a component and whether an ancestor is one; the rule's own body is a list of exceptions.
//
// `no-multi-comp` already ports that detection pass as `collectDetectedComponents` and
// `statelessComponentFor`, against the same authority and the same version. This rule reaches for
// them rather than deriving component-hood a second time, for the reason the brief gives about
// extension rules: two implementations of one question are two chances to disagree about it.
//
// # The scope walk is an AST walk here, measured rather than assumed
//
// Upstream's `getParentStatelessComponent` walks `scope.upper` and calls `getStatelessComponent` on
// each `scope.block`. We have no scope analysis, and the natural substitute is the chain of
// enclosing function-like AST ancestors. Those are different objects and the substitution had to be
// measured rather than argued.
//
// Measured on 2026-08-27 by instrumenting the installed 7.37.5 build and capturing both chains at
// every call the corpus produces: 484 calls, and after collapsing the consecutive duplicates ESLint
// emits for a function's own parameter scope, the two sequences agree on all 484. Controlled by
// removing the function kinds from the AST side, which took the disagreement count to 432, so the
// comparison can distinguish the two rather than passing vacuously.
//
// # Parentheses
//
// Our parser keeps `KindParenthesizedExpression`, which estree folds away, so an ancestry walk sees
// a node upstream never sees. Every walk here goes through `semanticParentOf`, which `no-multi-comp`
// already defines to skip them. Measured against the installed build: `<C footer={(() => <div />)} />`
// reports upstream, and without the skip the port was silent on it.
//

// isInsideRenderMethod is upstream's function of the same name, and here it is structurally

// # What upstream's guard actually protects against
//
// Its test is `node.parent.type === 'MethodDefinition' && node.parent.key.name === 'render'`, which
// is the node's DIRECT parent. In estree a class method is a `MethodDefinition` whose `value` is a
// separate `FunctionExpression`, so exactly one node in a class satisfies this: the render method's
// own function expression. Upstream's comment calls it "prevent reporting nested class components
// twice", and that is what it does: the render method's function expression is itself detected as a
// component sitting inside a class component, so without this guard the render method would report
// alongside whatever is nested in it.
//
// Measured against the installed 7.37.5 build on 2026-08-27, by evaluating upstream's own two
// conditions at every node the rule validates, for a class whose render nests a class component:
//
//	ClassDeclaration@2   parent=Program          isInsideRenderMethod=false
//	FunctionExpression@3 parent=MethodDefinition isInsideRenderMethod=true
//	ClassDeclaration@4   parent=BlockStatement   isInsideRenderMethod=false
//	FunctionExpression@4 parent=MethodDefinition isInsideRenderMethod=true
//
// The nested class, which is the thing that reports, answers false. Only the two method function
// expressions answer true.
//
// # Why there is nothing to reproduce
//
// Our parser has no separate node for a method's value: a `KindMethodDeclaration` carries its own
// parameters and body, so the node estree gates on does not exist here and is never handed to a
// listener. This rule's own walk anchors on five kinds and `KindMethodDeclaration` is not among
// them, matching upstream's five listeners, which name `FunctionExpression` rather than the method.
//
// So the guard has no input in this tree. It is written as a predicate that always answers false
// rather than omitted, because omitting it silently would leave the next reader comparing this file
// against upstream and finding a missing exception with no explanation.
//
// # What I got wrong, recorded because the wrong version passed forty cases
//
// The first version asked "is this node somewhere inside a render method", walking up through the
// enclosing block to the method. That reads as the same question and is not: it exempted every
// component nested in a render method, which is precisely the population this rule exists to
// report. It made four of upstream's failing cases silent while all forty passing cases stayed
// green, and only the corpus caught it.
func (s *unstableNestedState) isInsideRenderMethod(node *ast.Node) bool {

// isFunctionComponentInsideClassComponent is upstream's function of the same name.

// the third is what confines it to classes.
//
// # A mutation making this always false SURVIVES, and the reason is a parser difference
//
// Measured against the installed 7.37.5 build on 2026-08-27 by evaluating upstream's four conjuncts
// beside `components.get` at every validated node across the whole corpus: 196 nodes, the recovery
// fires for 8 of them, and it is DECISIVE, meaning `components.get` was false, for exactly 3.
//
// Those 3 are in upstream's invalid cases 10, 11 and 29, and in every one the decisive node is the
// class component's RENDER METHOD FUNCTION EXPRESSION rather than the nested component. Upstream
// recovers that node into the rule, and then `isInsideRenderMethod` immediately drops it again, so
// the pair is a no-op that exists because estree gives a method's value a node of its own.
//
// Our parser gives it none, so neither half has any input here, which is the same reason
// `isInsideRenderMethod` above is a constant. All three of those cases report correctly without the
// recovery contributing anything.
//
// Kept rather than deleted, on the same reasoning as the children-render-prop branch: it states
// upstream's judgment, and a change to `collectDetectedComponents` could make it load bearing.
// Three probe shapes were built to find an input where it decides something here, a function
// component in a render method, one in an ordinary method, and an arrow in a render method, and our

//
// # This walk INCLUDES the node itself, matching upstream
//
// Upstream's three components all start from `getScope(context, node)`, and ESLint's scope for a
// class or a function-like node is the scope that node CREATES, not the one it sits in. So
// `getParentES6Component(theClass)` returns that class, and `getParentStatelessComponent(theFn)`
// returns that function.
//
// Measured against the installed 7.37.5 build on 2026-08-27: over the whole corpus, 268 function-
// like nodes reached `getParentStatelessComponent` and `getScope(node).block === node` for all 268,
// with zero exceptions. Instrumenting the real helpers on upstream's invalid case 14 gives
// `ClassDeclaration@2: es6=ClassDeclaration@2` and
// `FunctionDeclaration@4: stateless=FunctionDeclaration@4`, both naming themselves.
//
// An exclusive walk reads as the obviously correct one, because "parent" is in the name and because
// `closestComponentAncestor` below genuinely IS exclusive. They are not the same walk:
// `getClosestMatchingParent` starts at `node.parent` explicitly in its own source, while these
// three start at a scope. Two walks in one rule, opposite on this point, and only one of them says
// so in its name.
//
// # What is NOT established: whether the difference is observable here
//
// An earlier revision of this comment claimed the exclusive version cost nine of upstream's failing
// cases. That was wrong, and it is recorded rather than deleted because it is the exact shape the
// brief warns about, a confident divergence written from attribution rather than from measurement.
// Both under-report groups were fixed by `isInsideRenderMethod` and `isComponentInProp`; running
// the whole corpus with BOTH walks made exclusive again passes all 77.
//
// A mutation flipping this walk back to exclusive therefore SURVIVES the sweep, and no fixture was
// added for it, because none could be justified: three candidate shapes were built to separate the
// two, a function component directly in a render method, one behind a plain helper function, and an
// arrow inside an arrow, and all three produce one finding under both versions and match upstream.
//
// This is deliberately not filed as an equivalence verdict. The only caller requires the result to
// be a CLASS, and a node being validated is never the class enclosing it, so inclusivity cannot
// change that half; the stateless half then asks `statelessComponentFor` about whatever it found,
// and for the inclusive case that is the node itself, which is already a component by construction.
// Both routes reach the same verdict, which is the "same answer by a different path" shape the
// brief names, and I could not prove no input separates them.
//
// The inclusive spelling is kept because it is what upstream does and the measurement above is
// solid, not because the difference was shown to matter.
