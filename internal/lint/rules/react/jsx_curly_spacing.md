## What it checks

Enforce or disallow spaces inside of curly braces in JSX attributes and expressions

## Why this recommendation

Incompatible with ESLint 10: the rule calls an API this version removed, so it throws rather than reports.

## Violations

None. The tree already satisfies this rule, so enabling it is a guardrail against future drift rather than a cleanup.
