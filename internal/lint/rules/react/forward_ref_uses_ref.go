//	valid:   forwardRef(() => {})
//	valid:   forwardRef(function (a, b, c) {})

//	invalid: forwardRef((props) => null)
//	invalid: React.forwardRef(function Component(props) { return null; })
//
// Ported from `react/forward-ref-uses-ref`, read against oxc's `forward_ref_uses_ref.rs` and
// measured against the release oxlint binary on inputs the imported corpus does not contain.
//
// # The name says "uses ref" and the rule never asks whether the ref is used
//
// This is the first thing to get wrong and the corpus settles it in one case. Upstream counts
// parameters. It does not look at the body, does not check whether the second parameter is read,
// and does not care what it is called:
//
//	forwardRef((props, ref) => null)      passes, and `ref` is never referenced
//	forwardRef((props, whatever) => null) passes, and the parameter is not named `ref` at all
//
// A port implementing the name rather than the behavior would look for a reference to the second
// binding, and the first of those two upstream pass cases would fail. The rule is a parameter-arity
// check wearing a use-analysis name.
//
// # Exactly one, which makes zero and three both silent
//
// The condition is `parameters_count() != 1`, so the reportable shape is narrow on both sides.
// `forwardRef(() => {})` and `forwardRef(function (a, b, c) {})` are both upstream pass cases. Only
// one is wrong, because only one is unambiguously a component that forgot the ref: none is a
// component that takes no props, and more than two is not a shape upstream is willing to guess at.
//
// A rest parameter disqualifies separately, and it has to, because oxc counts rest outside the
// parameter list. `forwardRef((a, ...b) => {})` has a `parameters_count()` of one and is silent
// only because `params.rest.is_some()` short-circuits first. Our tree carries rest *inside*
// `Parameters()`, so reproducing this means excluding it explicitly rather than inheriting the
// behavior, and the two spellings would diverge on exactly that input. Measured silent on oxlint.
//
// A TypeScript `this` parameter is likewise not counted, so `forwardRef(function (this: any, a) {})`
// reports: `a` is the only real parameter. oxc gets that from its own parameter model; we get it
// from `ast.IsThisParameter`. Also measured on oxlint rather than assumed.
//
// # What counts as a `forwardRef` call, which is looser than the plugin's name suggests
//
// Upstream matches `CallExpression::callee_name()`, which is a bare identifier's name or a member
// expression's static property name, and nothing else. There is no import tracking and no receiver
// check whatsoever, so all of these report, measured on oxlint:
//
//	NotReact.forwardRef(function (a) {})    any receiver at all
//	obj.deep.forwardRef(function (a) {})    any depth
//	React["forwardRef"](function (a) {})    a computed static string
//	(React).forwardRef(function (a) {})     parens on the object are irrelevant
//
// and an aliased import is silent, because the name at the call site is what is read:
//
//	import { forwardRef as fr } from 'react'; fr(function (a) {})
//
// `internal/utilities/react/IsNamespacedMember` is the helper whose name matches this question and it
// is the wrong one twice over: it hardcodes its receiver to `React` alone, which would silence the
// four receivers above, and it requires a property access, which would silence the bare
// `forwardRef(...)` form that is most of the corpus. Its body was read rather than its name.
//
// # Parentheses, measured in three places because they fall two different ways
//
// No imported fixture writes a parenthesized anything, so each of these is pinned by a fixture
// below and every one was run against the release binary rather than reasoned about.
//
// Upstream destructures the callee and the argument directly, with no paren skipping, so wrapping
// either one makes the rule blind:
//
//	(forwardRef)(function (a) {})           silent
//	(React.forwardRef)(function (a) {})     silent
//	forwardRef((function (a) {}))           silent, the argument is parenthesized
//
// But the *statement-context* question below runs through `outermost_paren_parent`, which does see
// through parens, so there the answer flips:
//
//	(forwardRef(function (a) {}));          reports, and offers only the add-ref suggestion
//
// Reproducing all four means declining parens at the callee and the argument while skipping them
// when walking to the parent. That asymmetry is upstream's, not ours, and a port applying paren
// skipping uniformly in either direction is wrong on three of these four inputs.
//
// # Two suggestions, or one, decided by whether removing the wrapper would break the file
//
// Both repairs are suggestions rather than fixes: each changes what the code means. Removing the
// wrapper changes the component's identity, and adding a parameter changes its signature.
//
// The wrapper-removal suggestion is withheld for exactly one shape: an *anonymous* function
// expression whose call sits directly in an expression statement. Unwrapping there would leave
// `function (a) {}` as a statement, which does not parse. Every other shape gets both.
//
// Upstream guards only the anonymous case, and the named one is a real wart that is reproduced
// rather than improved on. `forwardRef(function Named(a) {});` at statement level offers a removal
// producing `function Named(a) {};`, which parses but is now a hoisted function *declaration*
// rather than an expression. That is a meaning change beyond the one intended, and it is a
// suggestion a human reads before applying, which is the only reason it is tolerable. Measured by
// running oxlint with suggestions applied rather than by reading the branch.
//
// # No options and no type checker
//
// oxc's struct is a unit struct with no configuration parsing, and its single tester block carries
// no option tuples, so the surface is empty rather than merely unused_exports. Every question here is
// syntactic: which name the callee spells, how many parameters the function has, what kind the
// parent node is. Nothing asks what an identifier binds to, so nothing declares `NeedsTypeChecker`,
// and declaring it would not let the rule answer the aliased-import case anyway, because upstream
// does not ask that question either.
