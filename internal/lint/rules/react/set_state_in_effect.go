// React's own `validateNoSetStateInEffects`, which is `ErrorCategory.EffectSetState`. oxc's linter
// rule at `crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/set_state_in_effect.rs` is the twenty-two-rule
// dispatcher body `run_react_compiler_rule(ctx, ErrorCategory::EffectSetState)`, so the judgment
// lives in the compiler crate on that side too.

//
// React is the authority here per the port brief's table. Every behavioural claim in this comment
// was established by RUNNING React 7.1.1 through the ESLint Linter API on the exact input named,
// not by reading, and reading gave the wrong answer twice: on which names count as effects, and on
// a function defined inside the effect body.
//
// # What upstream actually treats as an effect callback, measured rather than assumed
//
// This is the half of the rule its sibling `set-state-in-render` does not face, so it is stated
// precisely. Upstream's test is three type predicates, `isUseEffectHookType`,
// `isUseLayoutEffectHookType` and `isUseInsertionEffectHookType`, each comparing the callee's
// inferred type against a `shapeId` from React's builtin registry. A name reaches that registry
// through `Environment.getGlobalDeclaration`, which keys the lookup on the name a binding was
// DECLARED as: `binding.imported` for a named import, `binding.name` for a global or a namespace
// member. So the decision is: does this callee resolve to a declaration named exactly `useEffect`,
// `useLayoutEffect`, or `useInsertionEffect`.
//
// Four consequences, each measured on the input named rather than inferred from that sentence:
//
//   - **A local rename still reports.** `import {useEffect as useFx} from 'react'; useFx(...)`
//     reports, because `binding.imported` is `useEffect`. The local spelling is not consulted.
//   - **The reverse does not.** `import {somethingElse as useEffect} from 'react'` is SILENT,
//     which is the same rule read the other way and is the case that proves the local name is not
//     what is being asked.
//   - **A namespace member is the same question.** `React.useEffect(...)` reports, and needs no
//     syntactic special case here, because the checker resolves the property access to the same
//     `useEffect` declaration a named import resolves to.
//   - **A custom hook is NOT an effect, however it is spelled.** `useMyEffect2` does not report and
//     neither does `useEffective`. Both were run. This matters because a related rule,
//     `exhaustive-deps`, computes `isEffect` as the regex `/Effect($|[^a-z])/` at bundle line 940,
//     under which `useMyEffect2` WOULD be an effect and `useEffective` would not. That regex
//     belongs to that rule and is not consulted by this one; porting it here would report a class
//     of custom hooks upstream is silent on, and no fixture in either corpus contains either name.
//
// A locally declared `function useEffect` is silent, and an import of `useEffect` from a non-React
// module is silent too, both measured. Those two are NOT reproduced here and the divergence is
// deliberate; see "Where this diverges" below.
//
// # How a setter is identified, and why no React seed data is needed
//
// `@types/react` declares `useState<S>(): [S, Dispatch<SetStateAction<S>>]`, so the setter element
// of the returned tuple carries the type ALIAS `Dispatch` while the value element does not. That is
// the whole predicate. The checker is asked for the callee's type and the alias symbol's name is
// compared against `Dispatch`.
//
// **The alias is the correct field and the symbol is not**, which is worth stating because reaching
// for the symbol is the natural first move and it fails silently. Probed on a real program: a
// setter's `Type_symbol` is the anonymous type literal behind the alias, so keying on it reports a
// genuine setter as not-a-setter. The mirror-image trap belongs to the sibling rule `refs`, where
// `RefObject` is an interface and therefore lives in the SYMBOL with a correctly nil alias. One
// predicate cannot serve both, and an agent that wrote one for both reported a genuine `useRef` as
// neither.
//
// Two properties this buys with no extra code, both probed rather than assumed:
//
//   - **An alias chain is free.** `const aliased = setState; aliased(1)` still reads `Dispatch`,
//     because the checker propagates the type through the assignment. Upstream needs its
//     `LoadLocal`/`StoreLocal` bookkeeping to follow that; here it falls out of resolution. The
//     bookkeeping is still transcribed below, because it is also what carries a setter through a
//     function boundary, which the type alone does not do.
//   - **`useReducer` does not collide.** Its `dispatch` carries `ActionDispatch`, a different
//     alias, so it is correctly not a setter. Measured: a `dispatch` called in an effect is silent
//     upstream too.
//
// # Why this needs the intermediate representation
//
// The transitive case is the reason, and it is upstream's own shape. `const f = () => setS(1);`
// declared beside the effect and called as `f()` inside it REPORTS, at two levels of indirection as
// well. Answering that from syntax means tracking which locals hold a setter, following them
// through assignments, and then asking whether a value flowing into `useEffect`'s first argument
// transitively reaches one. That is `setStateFunctions`, upstream's map, and it is a dataflow
// question over values rather than a property of any one call site.
//
// The ref exemption below needs the graph for a second, independent reason.
//
// # The ref exemption, and the one place this deliberately stops short
//
// `enableAllowSetStateFromRefsInEffects` defaults to TRUE in the shipped rule (bundle line 31649),
// so the exemption is live rather than experimental, and it decides six of the twelve imported
// cases. It has two halves and both are reachable on their own, measured with the other held out:
//
//	value taint         useEffect(() => { setS(r.current + 1); }, [])   silent
//	control dominance   useEffect(() => { if (r.current) setS(1); }, []) silent
//	neither             useEffect(() => { const x = r.current; setS(1); }, []) REPORTS
//
// The third line is the control that makes the first two mean something: merely mentioning a ref
// in the effect does not exempt it.
//
// **Both halves are implemented here.** The value-taint half tracks a `refDerivedValues` set through
// the effect's blocks; the control-dominance half asks `high_level_intermediate_representation.ControlDominators` whether the block
// holding the setter is control-dependent on a branch whose test is ref-derived.
//
// The control half was missing for a while and the file said so, because
// `internal/utilities/hir/postdominator.go` had the tree and kept it unexported: it exposed
// `UnconditionalBlocks`, which answers "does this block lie on every path to a return", the question
// `set-state-in-render` asks. The frontier is a different question over the same tree and
// additionally needs the branch test's Place, so `ControlDominators` sits beside it on the shelf
// rather than inside this rule.
//
// Measured on the tree this gates: the control half moved 20 findings to 15, silencing the
// ref-sentinel shape `if (previousReference.current !== value) setValue(value)`. Tainting a store's
// own lvalue took it to 10, silencing the measure idiom, `const element = reference.current` and
// then a read of `element.scrollHeight`, which cannot be computed during render at all.
//
// # Behaviours that look like defects and are upstream's
//
//   - **A function defined INSIDE the effect is never followed.** `useEffect(() => { const f = ()
//     => setS(1); f(); })` is SILENT, while moving that same declaration one line up, outside the
//     effect, REPORTS. Measured on both inputs. The mechanism is visible in the algorithm:
//     `getSetStateCall` walks the effect function's own blocks, and a function declared inside it
//     is a nested `FunctionExpression` whose body those blocks do not contain. The map it consults
//     was populated in the ENCLOSING function, so only setters that crossed the boundary from
//     outside are known. This is a real hole rather than an exemption, and it is reproduced.
//   - **A `useCallback` or `useMemo` wrapper is invisible to both sides**, because upstream deletes
//     it before this validator runs and this rule now reads a graph prepared the same way: the
//     erasure, then the inlining pass that follows it one line later upstream. See
//     `high_level_intermediate_representation.ForFunctionWithoutManualMemoization`; the fixtures are
//     `TestSetStateInEffectSeesThroughManualMemoization` and
//     `TestSetStateInEffectReachesThroughAMemoizedCallbackThatReturnsAFunction`.
//   - **A setter reached through a callback is silent, by the same mechanism running the other
//     way.** `setTimeout(setS, 10)` and `subscribe(() => setS(1))` are both clean, which is the
//     rule's actual purpose: the setter is not called during the effect body.
//   - **One finding per effect, not per call.** Three `setS` calls in one effect report ONCE,
//     because `getSetStateCall` returns the FIRST setter it finds and stops. Two separate effects
//     report twice. Both measured.
//   - **The dependency array is not consulted at all.** `useEffect(cb)` and `useEffect(cb, [])`
//     behave identically, and a setter passed as the SECOND argument is silent.
//
// # Where this diverges, and why
//
// Upstream distinguishes an import of `useEffect` from React from a same-named local declaration or
// an import from an unrelated module, and is silent on the latter two. That distinction lives in
// `Environment.getGlobalDeclaration`'s switch over binding kinds. This rule cannot make it: our
// lowering leaves `LoadGlobal.BindingKind` at `Global` for every global, never populating `Source`
// or `Imported`, documented at `internal/utilities/hir/lower.go:58` and confirmed still true here.
//
// The divergence is therefore that a function named exactly `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect` or
// `useInsertionEffect` that is NOT React's would be treated as an effect. Its practical reach is
// bounded by the other half of the rule: a finding still requires a genuine `Dispatch`-typed setter
// from a real `useState`, so the false-positive surface is a file that declares its own `useEffect`
// AND calls a real React setter synchronously inside it. No instance appeared in the dry run
// described below, which is a weaker statement than "none exists" and is deliberately left weaker.
//
// # What the dry run actually found, which is the honest summary of this port
//
// Run over Kirk's tree with `--no-fix --lint --timing`: 20 findings over 3,407 files, and every one
// was read rather than counted. It does not explode.
//
// That figure predates both the manual-memoization erasure and the ref work that landed beside it.
// Re-measured after the erasure: 2 findings over 3,482 files, both `useCallback`-wrapped async
// fetches called from an effect, both confirmed against React 7.1.1. One of the two is reported by
// React as well; the other is not, and the difference is the ref exemption rather than this change.
//
// The cost figure below is also from that first run and has moved since, in the rule's favour: the
// same tree now attributes about 40ms to this rule, and `refs` is the expensive one at roughly
// 1.5s. The per-rule numbers in this paragraph came from a `--timing` run, which times every
// listener call and is slower than a real one, so they compare rules to each other and are not the
// tool's speed. What has not changed is the reason they are what they are, which is why the
// paragraph stays.
//
// **It costs 888ms, which is 10% of all rule time and the most expensive rule in the run.** That is
// stated plainly rather than buried, but it is a property of the approach rather than of this rule:
// its two nearest neighbours are `set-state-in-render` at 571ms and `static-components` at 532ms,
// and those three are exactly the three rules built on the intermediate representation. Every
// syntactic react rule in the same run is between 1ms and 20ms. Lowering every function in the file
// is the cost, it is paid once per rule today because each lowers independently, and the obvious
// saving is a per-file cache of the lowered form shared across the three. This rule sits above the
// other two because it also asks the checker a type question per call site.
//
// **Roughly three quarters of them are the post-dominator gap above, not new information.** Each
// was reproduced as a minimal shape and run against React 7.1.1, and the ref-controlled ones are
// silent upstream: a measurement effect reading `ref.current` and setting a derived flag, a panel
// that opens when a `previousXReference` transitions, a focus flag set behind a DOM identity check.
// Those are false positives by upstream's standard and they are the cost of shipping the value half
// of the ref exemption without the control half.
//
// **A real minority are true positives that React reports too**, verified the same way: an
// unguarded functional `setNodes` in an effect keyed on a prop, at
// `OsKingdomGraphCanvas.tsx:242`, is the clearest, and React reports the reproduced shape.
//
// A third group is the custom-hook divergence: a setter reached through a hook or a context object
// rather than a direct `useState`, which the checker still types as `Dispatch` and upstream has
// lost the shape of. `DropArea.tsx` is that shape, measured silent upstream.
//
// The proportion is recorded because it is the fact a reader most needs and the one most likely to
// go stale: **this rule is materially noisier than upstream until post-dominators land**, and the
// fixture `refControlledBranchIsAKnownDivergence` is the thing that will fail when they do.
//
// Recorded rather than smoothed over, and a differential run against a tool implementing upstream's
// binding-kind switch or its control dominators will show differences here for those reasons.
