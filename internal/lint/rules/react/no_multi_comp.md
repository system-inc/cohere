## What it checks

Disallow multiple component definition per file

## Why this recommendation

The codebase is actively moving toward one component per file per the recent 'each file holds one component' commits.

Kirk ruled on 2026-10-01 that this rule is strict and stays on: one component per file. The in-house size-banded rule it was first audited beside, which fired only past 60 lines, was retired and deleted rather than switched off, and `structure/react-component-require-matching-file-name` was added as the other half of the same promise: once a file holds one component, the file is named for it.

> Reviewed against real violation sites and the house conventions in `CLAUDE.md`,
> which moved this from **No** to **Maybe**. The first pass classified rules by
> correctness-versus-style crossed with violation count, and that is blind to
> whether a rule fights a convention we chose on purpose.

### What fixing looks like

Not auto-fixable. Each site needs a human decision, which is what makes the count above the real cost.
