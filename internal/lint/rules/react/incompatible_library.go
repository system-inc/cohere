		"stale data. The API hands back a new function on every render on purpose, because that " +
		"is how it tells you something changed. Memoizing the component that calls it, by hand " +
		"or by compiler, freezes that function at its first value and the screen stops following " +
		"the data. React Compiler skips optimizing this component rather than break it, so the " +
		"component silently loses memoization. Read the value out at the call site and pass the " +
		"plain data onward, rather than passing this API's own functions into memoized code.",

// # What this rule is, and why the measurement that unblocked it understates it
//
// The research pass that cleared this rule described it as "a config mechanism, not three names",
// on the evidence that the three shipped entries live outside `globals.rs` and that all three
// upstream fixtures import a synthetic module a test harness registers. Both observations are
// correct and the conclusion drawn from them is not, which matters because it decides whether this
// rule can ever fire on this tree.
//
// The distinction is against `configuration.go`, which really is the shape that measurement describes.
// That rule's default table is *self-consistent at every entry*, so it is structurally unable to
// report without a user-supplied provider cohere has no channel for. This one is the opposite:
// every one of the three default entries carries a live `knownIncompatible` message, and the
// message is the entire firing condition. The table is not a schema waiting to be filled, it is
// three real libraries with three real diagnostics already in it.
//
// **Measured on the executable rather than argued.** React 7.1.1 driven through the ESLint Linter
// interface, with no configuration beyond enabling the rule:
//
//	import {useReactTable} from '@tanstack/react-table';    reports
//	import {useVirtualizer} from '@tanstack/react-virtual'; reports
//	import {useForm} from 'react-hook-form'; watch() called  reports
//	import {useSomething} from 'some-random-module';        silent
//
// So the honest port is the three names, and this rule fires on real source with no configuration
// at all. The seam below exists so the synthetic-module fixtures can also be run, not because the
// shipped table is unreachable.
//
// The second, independent confirmation is oxc's own lint corpus. oxc *does* ship a lint rule here,
// which is a correction to the standing belief that this family has none on that side: its single
// failing case imports the genuine `@tanstack/react-table` rather than the synthetic module, which
// is only a sensible corpus if the default table fires. React and oxc agree on the span and on the
// message text, so there is no divergence to record for this rule.
//
// # What decides a finding
//
// Three conditions, all measured against React 7.1.1 rather than read off the emit site:
//
//	the callee resolves to a named import from a module in the table
//	the entry for that imported name carries an incompatible message
//	the call happens inside a component or a hook
//
// The third is load-bearing and is the whole reason this rule is not a grep. Measured, holding the
// call fixed and moving only the enclosing function's name:
//
//	function Component() { useReactTable(); }   reports
//	function useThing()  { useReactTable(); }   reports
//	function helper()    { useReactTable(); }   silent
//	const t = useReactTable();                  silent   (top level)
//	class Widget { render() { useReactTable(); } }  silent
//
// It has to be *called*. An import that is never used, or one passed onward as a value, is silent
// at upstream, because the diagnostic is raised while inferring the effects of a call rather than
// while resolving the import.
//
// # One finding per function, and why that is not a bug to fix
//
// Upstream `throw`s at the emit site rather than pushing onto an error list, which aborts
// compilation of the enclosing function. Measured consequence: a component calling two different
// incompatible APIs reports **once**, on the first in source order, and the same call written twice
// also reports once. Reproduced here rather than corrected, since reporting both would be a
// different rule than the one being ported, and the count is a visible behavior a differential run
// would show.
//
// # Where this port is narrower than upstream, stated with the command that established it
//
// A local alias defeats it: `const local = useReactTable; local();` is **silent at React too**,
// measured, so the narrowness is upstream's and is reproduced rather than introduced. But this port
// is genuinely narrower in one place, and it is worth naming rather than leaving for a reader to
// discover. Upstream tracks the *value* through its intermediate representation, so it follows the
// import through a destructure of a hook's return object. This port matches syntactically. The
// consequence is confined to `react-hook-form`, the only entry whose message hangs off a nested
// property, and it is handled by matching the destructured property name against the entry's nested
// table. What is not handled is an arbitrary chain of re-assignments between the hook call and the
// property access, which needs the binding-resolution pass this rule deliberately does not build.
//
// Deliberately NOT reproduced: with a JavaScript-only parser, ESLint reads `import type {x}` as a
// default import named `type` and reports at the specifier with an empty span. That is an artifact
// of parsing TypeScript syntax without a TypeScript parser, not a judgment about the code, and our
// parser gets the shape right. Measured and declined rather than ported.
//
// # No intermediate representation, no type checker, and why
//
// Neither is needed and both were considered rather than skipped. The question this rule answers is
// "does this call site name an import from one of three modules, inside a component", which is
// answered by the import clause and the enclosing function's name. The checker would add nothing:
// the modules are third-party packages that a fixture cannot resolve and that carry no useful type
// information for this decision, and the module specifier is compared as a *string* at both
// upstreams. Declaring the checker would make every fixture need the typed harness to answer a
// question no type is consulted for.
