// Every upstream case below is verbatim from
// `oxc/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/react/no_unsafe.rs`: 10 pass and 4 fail, from a single tester
// block. The extractor warned of a discrepancy, 12 diagnostics against 4 fail inputs, and the
// warning is real here rather than the multi-snapshot artefact the brief describes: there is one
// snapshot file, it carries 12 location headers, and each of the 4 fail inputs writes 3 lifecycle
// members, so the partition is 3 findings per input and needed no recovery by line alignment.
//
// The strings were decoded from the extractor's `-dump` output as JSON and then compared byte
// against byte into the Rust source by a script before any Go was written. All 14 matched, and a
// second script confirmed none of them contains a backslash or a quote, so the escape-cooking
// hazard that has bitten four previous porters could not arise here.
//
// # Four of the fourteen cases are byte-identical pairs across an option axis
//
// Upstream's corpus is 10 distinct sources, not 14. Cases 7 and 11 are the same bytes, as are 9
// and 13, differing only in a configured React version; cases 7 and 11 likewise for `checkAliases`.
// The pairs split by `checkAliases` are reproduced here on both sides of the flag. The pairs split
// by React version cannot be, and the two pass halves are recorded as reporting; the reasoning is
// at the line.
