## What it checks

Enforce React components to have a shouldComponentUpdate method

## Why this recommendation

Stylistic, but the tree already satisfies it, so enabling costs nothing and prevents drift.

## Violations

None. The tree already satisfies this rule, so enabling it is a guardrail against future drift rather than a cleanup.
