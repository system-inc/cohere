//
// # THE CLONE AND THE INSTALLED BUILD DISAGREE, and this port follows the CLONE
//
// This is the one rule in its batch where the two authorities differ, and the difference is a whole
// branch rather than a detail. The clone's `checkFunctionsBlockStatement` inspects the returned
// expression and descends into a conditional or a logical:
//
//	if (argument.type === 'ConditionalExpression') { ...consequent, ...alternate }
//	else if (argument.type === 'LogicalExpression' && isJSX(argument.right)) { ...right }
//	else { checkIteratorElement(argument) }
//
// The installed build, 7.37.5, passes `returnStatement.argument` straight to
// `checkIteratorElement`, which handles only a JSX element or fragment and silently ignores
// anything else. So SIX of upstream's own reporting cases are silent on the installed build:
//
//	[1,2,3].map((item) => { return c ? <div/> : <span/>; })     clone 2, installed 0
//	[1,2,3].map(function(item) { return c ? <div/> : <span/>; }) clone 2, installed 0
//	Array.from([1,2,3], (item) => { return c ? <div/> : <span/>; }) clone 2, installed 0
//	the Fragment-wrapped variant of the first                    clone 2, installed 0
//	[1,2,3].map(x => { return x && <App />; });                  clone 1, installed 0
//	[1,2,3].map(x => { return x || y || <App />; });             clone 1, installed 0
//
// Measured on the installed build, and confirmed by diffing the two rule files: the clone carries
// unreleased commits on top of the 7.37.5 tag while still reporting that version string.
//
// **The clone is followed** because it is the implementation that defines the rule and it is the
// one whose corpus states these verdicts. The installed build is a snapshot of it that is behind.
// Every one of the six is a fixture, marked, so a later reader comparing our output against the
// installed ESLint sees exactly which six inputs are expected to differ and why, rather than
// finding six unexplained extra findings.
//
// Note what does NOT differ: the ARROW-BODY forms, `map(x => x && <App/>)` and
// `map(x => x ? <A/> : <B/>)`, report on both, because `checkArrowFunctionWithJSX` has always had
// the conditional and logical arms. Only the BLOCK-bodied path was missing them. That pairing is
// what makes the divergence easy to misread as a bug in the port.
//
// # Four listeners, and what each one is actually anchored on
//
// Upstream registers five selectors and two of them are one thing:
//
//	ArrayExpression, JSXElement > JSXElement    the collection arm, both anchors in one handler
//	JSXFragment                                 the shorthand-fragment-in-an-array arm
//	CallExpression[...map]                      the iterator arm
//	CallExpression[...from]                     the iterator arm again, second argument
//	Children.toArray(...)                       a suppression scope, not a judgment
//
// The collection arm's two anchors do NOT report the same things. Its `missingArrayKey` finding is
// guarded by `node.type === 'ArrayExpression'`, so a keyless element nested directly inside another
// element is SILENT: `<div><App /></div>` reports nothing, measured. What the JSX anchor is for is
// the other two findings, duplicates and key-before-spread, which apply to an element's children as
// much as to an array. A port that reported `missingArrayKey` from both anchors would fire on every
// nested element in the tree and pass the entire imported corpus, which writes no such case.
//
// # The two arms disagree about the CASE of the attribute name, and it is not a typo
//
// The iterator arm asks `hasProp(attributes, 'key')`, whose default options are
// `{spreadStrict: true, ignoreCase: true}`, so it uppercases both sides before comparing. The
// collection arm filters `x.name && x.name.name === 'key'` inline, which is exact. Measured on the
// installed build, and both directions are real:
//
//	[1,2,3].map(x => <App KEY={x} />);   SILENT   the iterator arm accepts it
//	[<App KEY={1} />];                   REPORTS  the collection arm does not
//
// Nothing in the corpus writes a capitalized key. Unifying the two would be the obvious cleanup and
// would change a verdict in one direction or the other, so both are spelled out here with the
// matcher named at each site.
//
// A spread also answers differently at the two sites. `hasProp` with `spreadStrict: true` returns
// FALSE for a spread, so the iterator arm treats a spread as not supplying a key and reports:
// `[1,2,3].map(x => <App {...p} />)` reports. The collection arm's filter finds no matching name in
// a spread either, so it reports too. They agree here by two different routes.
//
// # Children.toArray, which is a scope rather than a check
//
// Upstream sets a flag when it enters a `React.Children.toArray(...)` call and clears it on exit,
// and every other listener returns early while it is set. That is a containment question, so it is
// answered here by walking up the parent chain from the node being judged rather than by keeping a
// flag across a traversal whose order this rule does not control.
//
// The two accepted shapes are `<pragma>.Children.toArray(...)` and a bare `Children.toArray(...)`.
// Measured: `Foo.Children.toArray(...)` does NOT suppress and a bare `toArray(...)` does not
// either, so the `Children` segment is required in both spellings. The pragma is read from the
// file's `@jsx` comment, the same mechanism `no-deprecated` in this package documents at length.
var JsxKey = rule.Rule{
	// No namespace prefix. The config writes `react/jsx-key` and the parity guard strips the

		// twice, and carrying a guard that cannot fire would read as a discrimination this rule
		// makes.
		//
		// The reason is the anchoring rather than an argument about the rule. Upstream's selector
		// is `ArrayExpression, JSXElement > JSXElement`, so its JSX arm fires once per CHILD and
		// hands the handler that child's parent's children, visiting one collection as many times
		// as it has elements. This rule anchors the JSX arm on the PARENT instead, so every
		// collection is visited exactly once.
		//
		// After that, the two anchors are disjoint by construction: an element is reached by the
		// array arm when its parent is an array literal and by the JSX arm when its parent is a
		// JSX element, and a node has one parent. Measured rather than argued, by walking the
		// parse of four shapes including an array literal nested inside JSX children, which is the
		// case that looks like it should reach both: the parent kinds come back
		// `ArrayLiteralExpression` and `JsxElement` and never both for one node, because the array
		// sits inside a `JsxExpression` wrapper rather than being a direct child.
		//
		// The verdict expires if a third anchor is added, or if the JSX arm is moved back onto the
		// child. Either change needs this paragraph re-argued rather than merely re-read.
