// A ref is deliberately outside React's data flow: writing one does not schedule a render, and
// during render the ref may not yet point at the thing it will point at once the tree commits.
// Reading `current` while rendering therefore produces a value that is either stale or not yet
// attached, and because the read creates no subscription, nothing re-renders when it changes. The
// symptom is an interface that silently shows the previous frame's data and never corrects itself,
// which reads as a caching bug rather than as what it is.
//
// # Where this comes from
//
// React's own `ValidateNoRefAccessInRender.ts`, transcribed by oxc at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_validation/validate_no_ref_access_in_render.rs`, which is
// the version this follows at 1,060 lines. oxc's *linter* rule at `rules/react/refs.rs` is a
// four-line dispatcher into `run_react_compiler_rule(ctx, ErrorCategory::Refs)`, so reading only
// the rule file makes a large port look trivial. The judgment lives entirely in the compiler crate.
//
// # This rule reads no effect facts, which is why it could be written now
//
// It was widely believed that this rule waited on the mutation-effect table that
// `immutability` needs. It does not.
// `grep -cE 'impure|no_alias|callee_effect|known_incompatible|positional_params|return_value_kind'`
// over all 1,060 lines of the validator returns 0, measured with a live control in the same command
// (`RefAccessType` returns 100 on the same file, so the zero is a real absence rather than a bad
// pattern). What the rule actually consults is its own six-element lattice, two nominal type
// predicates, and the phi/load/store propagation this representation already provides.
//
// # The lattice, and the equality that is not identity
//
// Six elements: none, nullable, guard, ref, refValue, structure. The important part is not the
// elements but the equality relation over them, and it is the single subtlety most worth carrying
// forward. Upstream hand-writes `PartialEq` rather than deriving it, and its doc comment says why:
// a join mints a FRESH ref id, so an equality that compared ids would report "changed" on every
// iteration and **the fixpoint would never converge**. `refsTypeEqual` below reproduces that
// deliberately: `ref` ignores its id entirely, and `refValue` compares only its access span.
//
// Equality for convergence is not equality for identity. Two values that are genuinely distinct
// refs compare EQUAL here, and that is correct, because what the fixpoint needs to know is whether
// the lattice element moved, not whether the underlying ref is the same object. Deriving this
// comparison is the natural thing to do in Go and it produces a rule that either loops ten times on
// every function or emits a spurious non-convergence finding. `TestRefsConvergenceEqualityIgnores
// RefIdentity` pins it, and task `#g29j9ab` tracks lifting this traversal onto the shelf when a
// third rule needs it; if that happens, this hazard is the thing to carry with it.
//
// # Why this is a bounded sweep rather than a dataflow solve
//
// Upstream is `for iteration in 0..10` over the whole function, with one `changed` flag on a
// per-identifier map, and it emits a non-convergence diagnostic if still moving at ten. That is
// chaotic iteration keyed by identifier, not a per-block entry/exit lattice, so neither
// `control_flow_graph.Solve` nor a dominator tree is the right instrument even in principle.
//
// It is also worth recording that `control_flow_graph.Solve[V,E]` is mechanically unreachable from this
// representation regardless of fit: `control_flow_graph.Block`'s `index`, `final` and `thrown` fields are
// unexported and set only by `control_flow_graph.Build`, so a caller holding a `high_level_intermediate_representation.Function` cannot
// construct one. `ssa.go` and `postdominator.go` both already record this in their headers. Three
// rules shipped on this representation have now read that machinery and deliberately used none of
// it, so the bar for reaching for it is high and this rule does not clear it.
//
// The bound is reproduced exactly, ten rounds, including the non-convergence finding. On the real
// tree the sweep settled in two rounds on every function it saw; see the test file.
//
// # Two signals identify a ref, and BOTH are required
//
// This is the part a reader is most likely to get wrong, because either signal alone looks
// sufficient and each covers a different part of the corpus.
//
//   - **The checker.** `useRef` returns `RefObject<T>`, and a ref is identified by that type's
//     SYMBOL. `RefObject` is an interface, so its type alias is correctly nil. This is the exact
//     mirror image of `set_state_in_render.go`'s setter predicate, which keys on the ALIAS because
//     `Dispatch` is a type alias whose symbol renders as a non-printable internal marker. A
//     predicate written for one of them silently reports nothing for the other, and an agent
//     writing this rule keyed on the alias first and reported a genuine `useRef` as neither.
//     Probed on our own checker rather than assumed: `const myRef = useRef(null)` gives
//     `alias=<nil> symbol=RefObject`, while `setX` gives `alias=Dispatch symbol=<binary noise>`.
//
//   - **The name.** Upstream's `enableTreatRefLikeIdentifiersAsRefs` DEFAULTS TO TRUE
//     (`environment_config.rs:157`) and matches `/^(?:[a-zA-Z$_][\w$]*)Ref$|^ref$/` against the
//     name of the binding whose `current` is being accessed. Only 1 of the 42 corpus fixtures sets
//     the flag explicitly, so it is silently active across the whole corpus. This is what reaches
//     `props.ref`, a ref arriving as an untyped prop, where there is no `useRef` call for the
//     checker to type.
//
// Neither signal alone covers the corpus and shipping only the first would decline six fixtures
// silently. See the scope note below.
//
// # What the name signal matches, measured against the executable rather than read
//
// The regex reads as though it matches any `somethingRef.current` anywhere. It does not, and the
// difference is the object's BINDING name rather than the text of the member expression. Driven on
// `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` 7.1.1 through the ESLint Linter API on each input:
//
//	const fooRef = {};      fooRef.current        REPORTS   binding named fooRef
//	function C({fooRef})    fooRef.current        REPORTS   binding named fooRef
//	function C(props)       props.fooRef.current  CLEAN     binding is props, not fooRef
//	function C(props)       props.ref.current     REPORTS   the intermediate load is named ref
//	const q = props.fooRef; q.current             CLEAN     binding named q
//	const ref = props.any;  ref.current           REPORTS   binding named ref
//	const o = props.o;      o.ref.current         CLEAN     binding named o
//
// The apparent inconsistency between rows 3 and 4 is not a special case for `props`. Upstream types
// a property load as `Type::Property{object_name, property_name}` where `object_name` is the name
// of the object's own binding, and `is_ref_like_name` is asked at each unification. For
// `props.ref.current` the INNER load produces a value whose binding name is `ref`, and the outer
// `.current` then matches against that. For `props.fooRef.current` the inner load is also named
// `fooRef`, so by the regex it should match too, and upstream is nonetheless silent. Reading
// alone would have produced the wrong rule here in both directions; every row above is a
// measurement, and rows 3 and 5 are reproduced as silence deliberately.
//
// This rule keys the name test on `high_level_intermediate_representation.Identifier.Name`, which is the binding name for a named
// value and empty for a temporary, giving the same partition without re-deriving it.
//
// # `Ref` alone does not match, and that is upstream's text rather than an oversight
//
// The regex requires at least one character before `Ref`, so `fooRef` and `aRef` match while a bare
// `Ref` does not. Upstream states this in a comment at `infer_types.rs:235` and the executable
// agrees (`props.Ref.current` is clean, measured). Reproduced rather than tidied, because a rule
// that helpfully matched `Ref` would disagree with React on real code while looking more correct.
//
// # The component gate is NOT used here, and that is a deliberate difference from its neighbours
//
// `static_components.go`, `globals.go` and `set_state_in_render.go` all gate on the shelf's
// `IsComponentOrHookLike`, and three of them reuse the predicate whole. This rule does not, and the
// reason is that upstream's own gate for this validator is different. Measured on the executable: a
// lowercase `function helper(props) { return props.ref.current; }` is CLEAN, so a gate is real; but
// the gate that decides it is compilation admission, which for this validator already excludes a
// non-component. What this rule needs beyond that is the `!is_function_expression` condition at
// `infer_mutation_aliasing_ranges.rs:470`, which is "this is the outer function under compilation,
// not a nested function expression" and is a different question from "is this a component".
//
// So the compilation gate is reused (a function must look like a component or a hook and must
// actually create JSX or call a hook), and nested functions are analysed as INNER functions through
// the structure element rather than as subjects in their own right. A nested function that touches
// a ref does not report at its own site; it makes its enclosing binding carry a `readRefEffect`, and
// the finding lands where that function is CALLED. That is what makes `capture-ref-for-mutation`
// report at `handleKey('left')()` rather than inside `handleKey`.
//
// # One span where upstream has two, and one message shape
//
// Upstream's `ref_update` diagnostic carries a primary span and a secondary label pointing at the
// ref's origin. Our `Diagnostic` carries a single `Range`, so the primary span is kept where
// upstream puts it and the origin is dropped rather than moved into the message, because unlike
// `static_components` the origin here is usually the same identifier the span already names.
