// The six invalid cases are React's own, vendored at
// `oxc_react_compiler/fixtures/static-components/`, copied byte for byte and verified against the
// originals by hash rather than by reading. Each keeps its upstream pragma comment so a reader can
// find the source file. oxc's linter tester carries only one of these plus one clean case, which
// badly understates the corpus; the fixture directory is the real floor.
//
// The clean cases below the corpus are measured rather than invented. Upstream ships NO valid
// fixtures for this rule at all, so every pass case here was established by running the release
// `oxlint` binary on the input and recording what it decided. That is the port brief's rule about
// taking truth only from the corpus, applied where the corpus has a hole: a pass case written from
// belief would encode the same belief as the rule and pass for exactly the wrong reason.
