// A class literal's range starts at its opening quote, not inside the trivia before it.

// classLiteralFrom took the node's Loc, whose start includes leading whitespace, so for a literal on
// its own line or after a comma the "strip the quotes" step cut one character too early: the fix
// replaced the opening quote, the file stopped parsing, and the edit engine refused that file's
// whole batch, every other rule's fixes included. Measured by @system_cohere_format_markdown on
// perturbed input: 174 files in ahra and 175 in www-phi-health (1,755 and 1,932 refused fixes).
