// ClassSegmentsIn had no direct test, and a research pass marked it `unverified` for that reason.
//
// It was exercised only through `no-unnecessary-whitespace`, and its ranges were checked once by a
// throwaway probe that no longer exists. That is the gap the marking names: plausibly right, not
// shown right, and the next rule to reach for it would be trusting a probe nobody can re-run.
//
// The property that matters is the one a fix depends on: every segment's range must cover exactly
// its own static text and nothing else. A template head's own Loc spans "`flex  ${" with the
// backtick and the interpolation opener included, so a fix written against the untrimmed range
// deletes both and leaves a file that does not parse.
