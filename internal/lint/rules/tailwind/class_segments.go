// ClassSegment is one run of static class text, with the range that would rewrite exactly it.
//
// This is a third reading of the same surfaces, and the three are deliberately separate rather than
// one type with optional fields. They answer different questions and a rule that took the wrong one
// would be quietly wrong: ClassLiteral is "the whole class string, safe to rewrite", which excludes
// templates because they are only partly knowable; ClassTemplate is "where does static text meet an
// interpolation", which only a boundary rule wants; ClassSegment is "every run of static text,
// individually rewritable", which is what a rule that edits within a template needs.
//
// A plain string literal yields exactly one segment. A template yields one per static run, so
// `flex  ${x}  gap-2` yields two, and each can be repaired without touching the interpolation
// between them.
