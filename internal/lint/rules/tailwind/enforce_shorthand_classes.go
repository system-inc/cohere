// EnforceShorthandClasses reports longhand class pairs that a single class already expresses.
//
//	valid:   <div className="px-4" />
//	invalid: <div className="ps-4 pe-4" />
//	invalid: <div className="ml-1 mr-1 mt-1 mb-1" />
//
// # What this is for
//
// `ps-4 pe-4` and `px-4` emit the same declarations, so nothing surfaces the difference. The cost
// is that the pair is ambiguous evidence: it reads either as a deliberate choice to set the two
// sides independently, or as two edits that met in the middle, and the next person to change one
// side cannot tell which. The single class says the two move together.
//
// # Everything about a group has to agree, not just the value
//
// The value is the obvious half and the rest is what a reader would miss. Upstream requires the
// captured values to match (`ps-4 pe-8` is not a pair), and also the variants (`ps-4 hover:pe-4` is
// not), the negative sign (`-mt-2 mb-2` is not), and the important marker (`!pt-2 pb-2` is not).
// Each of those was measured against upstream rather than assumed, and each one silently widens the
// rule if dropped.
//
// The rebuilt class carries the variants, the sign and the marker of the group it replaces, so
// `hover:ps-4 hover:pe-4` becomes `hover:px-4` and `-mt-2 -mb-2` becomes `-my-2`.
//
// # Membership is checked, as upstream checks it
//
// Upstream asks the design system whether the shorthand it is about to suggest exists, and declines
// when it does not. This rule skipped that on the reasoning that a missing shorthand needs a theme
// that removed a framework utility, a shape neither corpus repository has, and that
// `no-unknown-classes` would catch the suggestion if one ever appeared.
//
// The table is patterns, and a pattern can build a class Tailwind never had. `w-screen h-screen`
// matches `w-(.*) h-(.*)` and suggests `size-screen`, which does not exist: `w-screen` is `100vw`
// and `h-screen` is `100vh`, so no one class sets both. Found when nested literals reached two of
// them in ahra (#1hmzh0z), and the author following the finding would have deleted a working pair
// for a class that does nothing. `no-unknown-classes` did catch it, one edit too late.
//
// So the design system is asked when there is one. Without a program (a syntactic fixture) or
// without a Tailwind entry point there is nothing to ask, and the rule reports as it did.
//
// Not fixable, for the reason its siblings are not: a class literal here wraps across lines with
// indentation that carries intent, and a fixer would be the first thing to reflow it.
//
// # Declining the fixer removes a finding, not just a fix
//
// Upstream reports every collapse twice on a real tree: once as the longhand pair, and once as
// "Unnecessary whitespace" at the gap its own fixer leaves when it replaces the second class with an
// empty string. Measured on Kirk's tree, where its four findings are the same two sites. This rule
// reports two, and the difference is entirely that second class of finding, which describes the
// state upstream's fix passes through rather than anything in the source a reader wrote.
