// Expectations measured by diffing the rule against the engine's own sort over the whole corpus,
// not by reading upstream: upstream delegates the entire question to `getClassOrder` in three
// lines, so its source says nothing about how the order is built.
//
// # Why every fixture here runs through a program
//
// The rule reads the live design system, so it declares `ReadsProgram` and takes `ctx.Program` to
// find the repository's stylesheet. `rule_testing.Run` hands a rule a nil Program, and the rule's own
// decline path returns nil listeners for that case rather than reporting. So every fixture in this
// file that used `rule_testing.Run` after the swap would have exercised the nil-Program branch: the
// reporting half would have failed loudly, and the whole silent half would have passed while
// proving nothing at all.
//
// That is the vacuous-probe shape `rule_testing.RunTyped`'s own comment describes one level up, and it
// is worth naming because it is the failure that hides: a suite going green on a rule that never
// ran. So the fixtures run through `RunTypedFiles`, which writes a real tsconfig and a real
// stylesheet into a temp directory, and the rule finds that stylesheet through the same entry-point
// search it uses on a real repository.
//
// The fixture stylesheet declares no tokens of its own, deliberately. A fixture theme that added
// tokens would test the fixture rather than the framework, and per-repository behaviour is what the
// differential in `internal/tailwind` measures against two real design systems.
//
// # The `@import` has to reach a real package, and a skip is the only honest alternative
//
// `findTailwindPackageRoot` walks upward from the stylesheet looking for `node_modules/tailwindcss`.
// A fixture written into `t.TempDir()` sits under the system temp directory, where that walk finds
// nothing, so `@import "tailwindcss"` cannot resolve and the rule declines.
//
// That decline is the rule behaving correctly, and it is exactly why it had to be fixed rather than
// accommodated: every fixture in the silent half would have passed on a `designSystemUnavailable`
// finding instead of on the order being right. Measured before the fix, this file reported
// `designSystemUnavailable` on 11 of the silent cases and on both message fixtures.
//
// So the import is pointed at the installed package by absolute path. When there is no installed
// tailwindcss to point at, the fixtures skip: a suite that cannot build a design system has not
// measured this rule, and saying "not measured" is the difference between an honest gap and a green
// run over nothing.
//
// # A skip is honest and it is still not free, so it is loud
//
// `cohere` vendors no `node_modules` of its own, so the walk has to start somewhere that has one. It
// starts at the corpus repository, which is where the class-order fixtures in `internal/tailwind`
// were captured from and the only installed 4.3.3 on this machine.
//
// The first version of this helper walked upward from `.`, the package directory. That finds nothing,
// so every fixture in this file skipped, and `go test` reports a file whose every case skipped as
// `ok`. Measured: 7 of 7 reporting cases and 13 of 13 silent ones skipped while the package printed
// PASS. A skip that reads as a pass is the same failure as silence that reads as agreement, one layer
// out, so `TestClassOrderFixturesActuallyRan` below fails rather than skips when the package cannot
// be found, and that test is the one that makes the rest of this file's greenness mean something.
//
// # The package is symlinked into the fixture rather than imported by absolute path
//
// Pointing the fixture's `@import` at an absolute path does not work, and the reason is worth stating
// because it looks like it should. The rule does not resolve the import itself: it calls
// `findTailwindPackageRoot`, which walks UP from the stylesheet's own directory looking for
// `node_modules/tailwindcss`, and hands the result to `LoadDesignSystem` as the resolver's root. A
// fixture in `t.TempDir()` has nothing above it, so that walk fails and the rule declines before it
// ever reads what the stylesheet imports. Measured: every reporting fixture came back
// `designSystemUnavailable` while the stylesheet held a perfectly good absolute import.
//
// So the fixture gets a real `node_modules/tailwindcss`, symlinked to the installed one. That makes
// the rule take exactly the path it takes on a repository — its own upward walk, its own resolver,
// the bare `tailwindcss` specifier — rather than a path arranged for the test.
