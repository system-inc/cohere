// The run-scoped design system: built once per program, shared read-only across the worker pool.
//
// This is the seam between `internal/tailwind`, which knows how to build a design system and
// nothing about when, and the rules, which need one on every file and must not each build their
// own. No rule reads it yet — swapping the rules over is #4q5dsn3 and #3r6cxrb. What lands here is
// the seam and the proof that it is built once.
//
// # The pattern, and the failure history it carries
//
// Copied deliberately from `internal/rules/structure/boundary_no_project_theme_value.go`, whose own
// comment records why each part is shaped the way it is:
//
//   - **Keyed on the program pointer, not on nothing.** That rule originally memoized in a
//     module-level variable with no key, which is correct for a process that lints once and exits
//     and wrong for anything that lints twice: the second tree reads the first's data. Pointer
//     identity gives a miss on a new program for free. `TestDesignSystemCacheKeyIsTheProgram`
//     mutates the key away and asserts the bug reappears, so the key is load-bearing rather than
//     decorative.
//   - **A package variable rather than `rule.FileCache`.** That cache is per-file by construction,
//     its own comment says sharing an entry across files would be a bug, and it carries no mutex.
//     It cannot live at registration either, since the program is built after rules register.
//   - **The mutex sits at the only access point and the key is immutable for the run**, so this is
//     safe under the parallel walk by construction rather than by discipline.
//
// # Why the build-once property is a test
//
// That same rule measured 2,329ms of setup against 0.54ms of listening across 1,862 files, 64.5% of
// all rule time for a rule that reported nothing, because the scan was redone per file. Nothing
// failed; it was only slow, and the comment still said "once per run".
//
// The design system build is the same shape. Measured on both corpus repositories: 0.68ms per build
// on ~/Projects/ahra, over a 9-file `@import` graph resolving 744 theme entries and 37 `@utility`
// blocks, and 0.64ms on www-connected-app for 748 entries. Per-file across 1,862 files that is 1.27
// seconds, and across the 3,416-file tree the rule catalog is measured on, about 2.3 seconds —
// against a lint phase that currently runs in 0.19s. The tool would get twelve times slower and
// every test would stay green.
//
// So `TestDesignSystemIsBuiltOncePerProgram` walks a real program with a rule that asks for the
// design system on every file, and asserts the process-wide build counter moved by exactly one.
// A counter is the only form of that claim that cannot decay.
//
// # Failing safe
//
// A design system that will not build is no opinion, never a clean tree. The load result carries
// its error and `DesignSystemForProgram` hands it back on every call, so a rule that cannot get one
// must decline and say so. Returning a zero-valued system instead would make every rule report
// nothing on a repository whose CSS moved, which is confident green over unchecked work and the
// exact failure cohere exists to remove.
