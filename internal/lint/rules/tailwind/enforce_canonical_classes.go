//
// This is the rule the collapse table exists for, and the one that cost the most to make portable.
// Tailwind's own answer comes from `canonicalizeCandidates`, a signature-equivalence search over the
// entire utility registry: it compiles each candidate to CSS, builds a property-to-value signature,
// enumerates every other root, reprints under each, intersects, then enumerates subsets. Porting
// that search was rejected twice, at eight to ten thousand lines that change every Tailwind minor.
//
// Porting its answers is a different proposition. 327 functional roots produce 53,301 pairs, of
// which 44 collapse, and each family is a fact about roots rather than a computation per class:
// `px + py => p` holds for every value the two roots share. So this rule reads a generated table and
// needs no JavaScript engine at lint time.
//
// # What it can and cannot see
//
// Measured by diffing this rule against the real engine over 2,693 literals with planted
// violations: 13 of the engine's 14 findings, and zero false positives.
//
// The one miss is `text-sm + leading-relaxed => text-sm/relaxed`, which merges by folding one
// class's value into the other's slash modifier rather than producing a third root. That is a
// different mechanism from a root family and no root table can express it.
//
// The error direction is deliberate and is the important part. This rule under-reports rather than
// over-reports, so its failure is a finding that does not appear, which someone notices, rather than
// noise on correct code, which is how a rule gets turned off.
//
// Single-class rewrites are also out of scope: `z-[1]` is `z-1` and `start-4` is `inset-s-4`, and
// both are properties of one class rather than of a pair. The table deliberately excludes them,
// because a generator that counted them as families reported 1,326 families including
// `-bg-conic + -end => -inset-e`, where one class rewrote alone and the other was an unrelated
// neighbour.
//
// # Why the preconditions are the whole rule
//
// Two classes only merge when everything except their root already agrees: their variants, their
// importance, and their value. `px-4 py-4` becomes `p-4`, but `px-4 py-2` collapses to nothing and
// so does `px-4 sm:py-4`. Getting that wrong in the permissive direction reports correct code.
//
// No fix, deliberately. The collapse is mechanical but the rewrite is not: the replacement has to
// be spliced into a class list whose order is `enforce-consistent-class-order`'s concern, and a
// rewrite that also reordered would fight it. Reporting the shorter spelling is enough for an
// author to act on.
