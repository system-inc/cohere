// Live class existence: whether a class is one *this repository's* design system defines.
//
// This is `no-unknown-classes`'s half of the seam #3r6cxrb crosses. Until this file, existence was
// answered from `KnownRoots` and `KnownStatics` in collapse_table.go, two tables generated from one
// repository under a header reading `Source: Tailwind 4.3.3`. After it, the question is put to the
// design system in front of the linter.
//
// # The defect, measured on a design system that shares nothing with ours
//
// `internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_descriptor_base/testdata/independent_theme.css` exists because the two corpus
// repositories cannot answer a framework-versus-repository question: they both vendor
// `libraries/structure`, so a fact they agree on may be a fact about the submodule. It declares
// `@utility synthetic-static` and `@utility synthetic-fn-*`, names no framework contains.
//
// Loaded as a design system and asked about its own classes, the shipped table answered:
//
//	synthetic-static      table says unknown    the repository declares it
//	synthetic-fn-small    table says unknown    the repository declares it
//	markdown-content      table says known      no repository here declares it
//
// The first two are the failure the task names: a repository's own `@utility` classes read as
// unknown, so the rule reports correct code on every repository except the one the table was
// generated from. The third is the same defect seen from the other side — 27 of `KnownStatics`'s
// 895 entries and 20 of `KnownRoots`'s 315 are names ahra or www-connected-app declared, so the
// table vouches for them everywhere.
//
// # Why ParseCandidate is the oracle and a table cannot be
//
// Where a class's root ends is not a property of its string. `border-b` reads both as the root
// `border-b` with no value and as `border` with the named value `b`, and which roots exist is a
// question about this repository's `@utility` blocks as much as about the framework. candidate.go's
// file comment states this as the reason the parser takes a design system rather than a table, and
// existence is the same question asked once: a class exists when the design system in front of us
// can read it as at least one candidate.
//
// That replaces the hand-written prefix walk this file's predecessor did over `KnownRoots`. The walk
// had to re-derive the value boundary itself — `remainder[0] == '-' || '/' || '[' || '('` — which is
// an approximation of what `parseCandidate` does properly, and the same approximation in a different
// guise is what lost `border-x` during the migration.
//
// # What does not change, deliberately
//
// The gap `TestKnownRootWithUnknownValueIsNotReported` pins stays open. `text-huge` parses as root
// `text` with the named value `huge` and compiles to nothing; the parser accepts it because the
// parser's job is structure rather than resolution. Closing it needs the theme's per-root value
// scales, and the error direction is the safe one: this rule under-reports rather than flagging
// working classes, which is how a rule survives contact with a codebase.
