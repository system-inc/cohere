// Expectations measured against the real plugin, and against the real corpus for the silent half.
// The silent cases matter more than usual here: this rule's failure mode is reporting a class that
// works, and a rule that flags working classes gets turned off the first time it does it.
//
// # Why every fixture here runs through a program
//
// Same reason `enforce_consistent_class_order_test.go` gives, and the same trap. The rule now reads
// the live design system, so it declares `ProgramReads` and returns nil listeners when the Program
// is nil. `rule_testing.Run` hands it exactly that. So every fixture in this file that kept using
// `rule_testing.Run` after the swap would exercise the nil-Program branch: the reporting half would fail
// loudly and the whole silent half would pass while proving nothing.
//
// Measured before these were converted: with the rule swapped and the fixtures still on
// `rule_testing.Run`, the eight reporting cases failed and all thirteen silent cases passed. Thirteen
// green assertions over a rule that never ran.
//
// `TestUnknownClassFixturesActuallyRan` is what stops the converted file from going green on nothing
// in the other direction, where the walk for an installed tailwindcss finds none and every fixture
// skips while `go test` prints ok.

// unknownFixtureStylesheetPath is where the fixture writes its root stylesheet.
//
// The first entry in `tailwindEntryPointCandidates`, so the rule's own entry-point search finds it
// by the same path it uses on a real repository.

// unknownFixtureStylesheet is the fixture's root stylesheet, and it declares utilities of its own.
//
// This is the one place this file's fixtures differ from the class-order ones, and the difference is
// the whole point of the migration. Those declare no tokens deliberately, because per-repository
// behaviour is not what they measure. Here it is exactly what is measured: a class this repository

// that for the repository it was generated from.
