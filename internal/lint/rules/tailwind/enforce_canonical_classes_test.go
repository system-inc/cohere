// The fixture corpus is the one the migration earned, and every entry in it was a real finding at
// some point. Several are the specific finding a cheaper approach silently lost.
//
// # Why every fixture here runs through a program
//
// Same reason `enforce_consistent_class_order_test.go` and `no_unknown_classes_test.go` give. The
// rule now reads the live design system to split a class into root and value, so it declares
// `ProgramReads` and returns nil listeners when the Program is nil. `rule_testing.Run` hands it exactly
// that, so a fixture left on it would exercise the nil-Program branch: the reporting half fails
// loudly and the silent half passes while proving nothing.
//
// `TestCanonicalFixturesActuallyRan` is what stops the converted file from going green on nothing in
// the other direction, where the walk for an installed tailwindcss finds none and every fixture
// skips while `go test` prints ok.

// runCanonicalFixture runs the rule against a one-file program that has a real design system.
//
// The fixture stylesheet declares no tokens of its own. Unlike `no-unknown-classes`, whose whole
// subject is what a repository adds, this rule's subject is the collapse families, and those are
// framework facts: 44 on ahra and 44 on www-connected-app, with none on either side alone.
