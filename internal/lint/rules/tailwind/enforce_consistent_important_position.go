			"\" now. Both still compile, which is exactly why a v3 habit survives a paste and then " +

			"as \"" + corrected + "\".",

// EnforceConsistentImportantPositionOptions lets a project name the surfaces that carry classes.
//
// Position selects which spelling is canonical: "recommended" is v4's trailing marker and is the
// default, "legacy" is v3's leading one. Named rather than inferred from the installed Tailwind,
// because a repository mid-migration wants to pick a target rather than have one read off its
// node_modules.

//	invalid: <div className="hover:!flex" />
//
// # Why this is worth a rule
//
// Tailwind v3 wrote the important marker as a prefix and v4 writes it as a suffix. v4 still accepts
// both, so a class pasted out of a v3 answer compiles and renders and reviews clean. The cost is
// that the two spellings then sit side by side in one codebase with nothing to say which one is
// current, and the next person to write an important class picks whichever they saw last.
//
// # This rule does not need the design system
//
// Unlike its siblings here it asks nothing of the theme: the marker's position is a property of the
// string. `!unknown-class` reports, measured against upstream, which is the tell that membership is
// not part of the question. So this rule declares no ProgramReads and does not pay for a
// design system it would not read.
//
// Variants are stripped before the marker is looked for, because `hover:!flex` carries its marker on
// the utility rather than on the class, and a check that read the whole string would miss it.
//
// The negative sign is handled as upstream handles it, which is a case a reader would get wrong:
// `-!mt-4` and `!-mt-4` both report, and both correct to `-mt-4!`. Upstream strips the leading `-`
// FIRST and looks for `!` after it, so a marker written on either side of the sign is found, and the
// rebuild always puts the sign outside. That is why the two spellings collapse onto one answer.
//
// A class carrying the marker on both ends is left alone, because the trailing one already
// satisfies the recommended position and upstream's condition is an early return on exactly that.
//
// # One deliberate divergence, on a class that is nothing but the marker
//
// Upstream reports a bare `!` with the replacement `!`, a finding whose fix changes nothing.
// Measured, not inferred: it strips the marker, finds an empty base, and rebuilds a string identical
// to the input. This declines instead. A finding a reader cannot act on is worse than no finding,
// because acting on it is a no-op and the rule then reports it again forever. `no-unknown-classes`
// already reports the same class with something a reader can do about it.
//
// Not fixable, for the reason its siblings are not: a class literal here wraps across lines with
// indentation that carries intent, and a fixer would be the first thing to reflow it.
