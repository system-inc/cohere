// The live table is verified against the engine, not against itself.
//
// A constructor that composes two halves can be self-consistent and wrong: the halves can agree with
// each other and disagree with Tailwind, which is the failure the whole descriptor slice is tested
// against rather than around. So the contract test builds a table with NewTable from a real design
// system and scores it against the engine's own readings in the fixture corpus, case for case, under
// the same rules descriptor_test.go uses for the measured table.
//
// Measured on both corpus repositories: 6,808 of 6,808 scored cases on ahra, and 6,806 of 6,806 on
// www-connected-app against that repository's own extraction. The second run is not automated here
// because it needs a fixture file generated against that repository, which is untracked for the same
// reason the table is. Reproduce it with:
//
//	node internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_descriptor_table/fixtures.mjs \
//	    ~/Projects/connected/www-connected-app/app/_theme/styles/theme.css > /tmp/connected_fixtures.json
//
// The corpus repositories are read from disk. When one is missing the test skips rather than
// passing, since a silent pass is what a broken lookup looks like.

// corpusRepositories are the design systems the port is measured on.
//
// Both are named rather than one, because the two halves this file composes can only be told apart
// by a system whose theme differs, and a single repository would let a per-repository token pass as
// a framework fact.
