// Whether the descriptor rows are still carrying something the ported handle bodies cannot compute.
//
// `baseDescriptors` is one of the two tables in this package that is not Tailwind's own data, and its
// stated reason is that a root's reading partitions on the value's resolved type while no
// registration shape carries both halves. That was true when it was written and the emitting half was
// not ported. It is ported now, across three slices and 242 roots, so the claim is measurable rather
// than argued and this measures it.
//
// # What a cell is, and how the branch that reaches it is built
//
// A row holds a type map, a namespace map, a fallback and an empty reading, per modifier axis. Each
// is an independent measurement, so this compares cells rather than roots, the way
// frameworkgaphandlers_test.go does.
//
// The branch per cell is read off `Lookup`'s own precedence rather than guessed, which four earlier
// attempts at this measurement got wrong in four different ways and every one of them looked like an
// emitter defect:
//
//   - A `ByType` cell is reached by an arbitrary value whose inferred type is the key, so the branch
//     is arbitrary. Sending a named value instead put `bg`, `text` and `font` on the wrong arm.
//   - A `--color` or `@colorKeyword` cell is reached through theme resolution rather than inference,
//     so `ResolvedAsColor` is what selects it, not `DataTypeColor`. Missing that reported 31 cells.
//   - A `Fallback` is a named value that matched no namespace and inferred as nothing. Whether that
//     lands on the colour arm is the row's own claim: a root whose fallback equals its `--color`
//     reading resolves an unmatched name as a colour, which is the eleven-root border family.
//   - `scale` has an empty type list, so nothing infers and `Lookup` returns `Fallback` for an
//     arbitrary value too. Its fallback is the arbitrary arm's reading rather than the named one.
//
// Each of those is a fact about how a class reaches a cell. Reconstructing them is the work this
// measurement is, and getting one wrong reads exactly like a port that cannot answer.
