// The `@utility` evaluator: the component that answers the readings the descriptor table declines.
//
// Ported from `createCssUtility` and `resolveValueFunction` in `src/utilities.ts` at Tailwind
// 4.3.3, read at the pinned tag rather than from the minified bundle, so a disagreement with the
// engine is a finding rather than version skew.
//
// # What this closes, and why it could not be another table axis
//
// The descriptor table (descriptor.go) answers a functional root's `{order, count}` as a function
// of its value's inferred data type, and Phase 0 measured that model holding on 37,625 of 37,643
// registry classes. The 18 it declines are all repository-defined `@utility` blocks of the form
// `<animation-root>-translate-full`, and they are not a defect in the model, they are its boundary:
//
//	@utility slide-in-from-top-* {
//	    --enter-translate-y: calc(--value(integer) * var(--spacing) * -1);
//	    --enter-translate-y: calc(--value(--percentage-*, --percentage-translate-*) * -100%);
//	    --enter-translate-y: calc(--value(ratio) * -100%);
//	    --enter-translate-y: calc(--value(--translate-*, [percentage], [length]) * -1);
//	}
//
// Each declaration resolves independently, and one whose `--value()` fails is dropped rather than
// defaulted. So arity is the count of survivors, and a value can satisfy several resolution paths
// at once: `50` is both an `integer` and a `--percentage` key, so two declarations survive and the
// class reads `[]#2`; `4` is only an integer and `translate-full` only a `--percentage` key, so one
// survives each and both read `[]#1`. No row of a table keyed on a single data type can express a
// count that depends on how many *different* types a value simultaneously satisfies, which is why
// this is a loop with a resolve-or-drop test rather than another axis.
//
// # The drop is the mechanism, and defaulting is the plausible wrong answer
//
// The single rule this file exists to implement is that an unresolvable `--value()` removes its
// declaration from the body. A port that instead left the declaration in place with an empty or
// literal value would agree with the engine on every class where every declaration resolves, which
// is most of them, and would report `[]#4` for every one of the 18. That is the shape of failure
// this component is tested against: see TestUtilityDropIsNotDefault, which mutates exactly this
// rule and asserts the differential catches it.
//
// # Four post-conditions, none of which is the resolve-or-drop rule
//
// Upstream applies four gates after the walk, and they decide validity rather than arity. Each is
// carried because each rejects a class the loop alone would accept:
//
//  1. `--value()` must have been used, and at least one use must have resolved. A body where every
//     declaration dropped compiles to nothing, which is a null reading rather than `[]#0`.
//  2. A used `--modifier()` that resolved nothing, with a modifier present, is invalid.
//  3. `--value(ratio)` resolving alongside a resolved `--modifier()` is invalid, because
//     `foo-2/3` cannot be read as both a fraction and a value-plus-modifier.
//  4. A candidate carrying a modifier is invalid unless either the modifier resolved or a ratio
//     did, for the same reason read from the other side.
//
// And then the splice: when `--value(ratio)` resolved, every declaration that resolved a
// *non-ratio* `--value()` is removed. `slide-in-from-top-1/2` reads `[]#1` and not `[]#2` because
// of it, since `1` alone would otherwise satisfy the `integer` declaration. This is a removal after
// the fact rather than a condition during the walk, and it is ordered that way here because the
// engine cannot know a ratio resolved until it has walked past declarations that resolved without
// one.
//
// # What is deliberately not ported
//
// `createCssUtility`'s pre-processing walk normalizes `--value(…)` argument spellings
// (`--value(--spacing)` to `--value(--spacing-*)`, whitespace removal, escaped `\*`) and collects
// suggestion metadata. The normalization is ported, in normalizeValueFunctionArguments, because it
// changes which theme namespace an argument names and therefore changes readings. The suggestion
// half is not: it feeds editor autocomplete, has no reader here, and an untested surface that reads
// as supported is worse than an absent one.
//
// The `--spacing(…)` tracking in the same walk exists only to serve suggestions and is likewise
// absent. `console.warn` on an unsupported bare data type is absent too: it is diagnostic output,
// and the `continue` that follows it, which is what actually decides the reading, is ported.
