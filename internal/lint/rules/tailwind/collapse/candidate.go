// The candidate parser: the function that turns a class string into the structured readings the
// rest of the engine compiles.
//
// Ported from `src/candidate.ts` at Tailwind 4.3.3, read at the pinned tag rather than from the
// minified bundle, so a disagreement is a finding rather than version skew.
//
// # The one property that matters more than the rest
//
// `parseCandidate` is a generator, and a class can have more than one reading. `border-b` is both
// the functional root `border-b` with no value and the root `border` with the named value `b`, in
// that order, and the engine compiles them in order and keeps the first that produces CSS. 178 of
// the 1,229 classes this repository actually writes read more than one way, and 2,760 of the 5,056
// classes in the fixture do.
//
// So the readings are a sequence, never a set. A port that produces the same readings in a
// different order is not slightly wrong: it silently resolves `border-b` to a different utility,
// with different declared properties, and nothing anywhere raises an error. That failure looks
// exactly like correct behaviour from every direction except a differential test, which is why the
// fixture records candidates as an ordered array and the test compares them positionally.
//
// # Why this cannot be a table
//
// Where the root of a class ends is not a property of the string. `border-b` splits after `border-b`
// and after `border` because both exist as functional roots; `ring-offset-2` splits after
// `ring-offset` and after `ring` for the same reason. Which roots exist is a question about this
// repository's `@utility` blocks as much as about the framework, so the split is a function of the
// design system and is recomputed per repository rather than baked into a generated table. Three
// hand-written splitters in `internal/rules/tailwind` currently answer it three different ways
// against three different generated tables, and a bug where two of them disagreed about whether
// `ring-offset` exists is what put this port on the roadmap. Replacing them is a separate task;
// this file only has to be right.
//
// # Bytes, not runes
//
// Upstream indexes UTF-16 code units and every character it compares against is ASCII. This port
// indexes bytes, which agrees for the same reason cssparser.go's port does: every byte of a
// multi-byte UTF-8 sequence has its high bit set and therefore equals none of the ASCII constants,
// so multi-byte text is copied through untouched.
