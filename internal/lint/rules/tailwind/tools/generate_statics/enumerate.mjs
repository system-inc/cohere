/*
 * Ask the real Tailwind 4.3.3 engine what every static utility declares, and emit it as JSON.
 *
 * This is the first component of #twutil, the port that removes `descriptor_base_table.go`. A static
 * utility takes no value, so its reading is a constant, and the constant is a walk over the
 * declarations it compiles to. That makes it the cheapest half of `createUtilities` to port and the
 * one that proves the shape for the functional half.
 *
 * # Generated rather than transcribed, and the reason is not effort
 *
 * `utilities.ts` at the pinned tag holds 485 `staticUtility(...)` calls, 357 of them literal
 * `[[property, value]]` pairs. Copying them into Go by hand is 485 chances to transpose a property
 * name into something that still compiles and still looks right, and the failure would be a wrong
 * reading rather than an error. Every other component in this slice generates its fixtures against
 * the engine for exactly that reason: `generate_data_type`, `generate_css_parser` and
 * `generate_theme` all ask rather than transcribe.
 *
 * The source count is also not the registry count, which is the second reason. `staticUtility` is
 * one of several registration paths and the source-side grep undercounts: the registry reports 917
 * static utilities where the source shows 485 calls. The source says what upstream wrote; the
 * registry says what it registered, and the registry is what the linter has to agree with.
 *
 * # Ground truth
 *
 * `designSystem.compileAstNodes(candidate)` returns the compiled tree, whose node shape is the one
 * `internal/tailwind/ast.go` already models: rules holding declarations, with `property` and `value`
 * on each declaration. It is an internal API and upstream may rename it, which is why the emitted
 * file records the version it was generated against and why `readingOf` is carried alongside as an
 * independent check: if the tree and the reading ever disagree, that is a finding rather than noise.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   node internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_statics/enumerate.mjs <theme.css> [--resolve-root <dir>] > statics.json

 * Declarations are read off the compiled tree rather than off the source.

 * A static utility can compile to a bare declaration list, to a rule holding one, or to several
 * rules: `sr-only` is nine declarations and `space-y-*` wraps its body in a `:where(...)` selector.
 * The walk below flattens to the sequence PropertySort would visit, which is breadth-first over the
 * container kinds it descends into, so the emitted `declarations` array is directly comparable to
 * what the Go side produces rather than requiring the consumer to re-derive an order.
