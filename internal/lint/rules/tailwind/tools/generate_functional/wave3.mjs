/*
 * Capture the compiled declarations of every multi-declaration framework root, per class.
 *
 * Waves 1 and 2a were tables of `{property}` because each root emitted exactly one declaration and
 * the property was readable from the source. This wave is not that, and an attempt to make it one is
 * what produced this file.
 *
 * # Why the source shape was not enough
 *
 * Twenty-one of these roots match a single pattern in `utilities.ts`: a properties wrapper, a
 * `--tw-*` declaration, and a final declaration of the real property. Extracting that pattern
 * suggested they all read the same way. They do not. Measured against the engine:
 *
 *     grayscale     [334,339]#2      one --tw- var plus filter
 *     skew-3        [69,70,71]#3     writes both --tw-skew-x and --tw-skew-y
 *     skew-x-3      [69,71]#2        writes one
 *     ease-linear   [354]#2          two declarations sharing one property position
 *
 * The wrapper is `atRoot([...])`, which PropertySort does not descend into, so it contributes
 * nothing to a reading. That part the source does predict. What it does not predict is how many
 * declarations survive underneath, and `ease` is the case that proves it: two declarations at one
 * order index, so a table keyed on the property name would have said `#1`.
 *
 * So this asks the engine for the declarations rather than inferring them from the handler's text.
 * A root's reading is captured per class, because arity here is not a property of the root: a
 * default value, a theme hit and a bare value can each produce a different count.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   node internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_functional/wave3.mjs <theme.css> [--resolve-root <dir>] > wave2b.json

 * The probe suffixes, and why the fraction ones are here.
 *
 * `-16/9` and `-3/2` were added after a mutation survived. `aspect` reads its bare value off
 * `Fraction` rather than `Value`, and no probe in the original set carried a slash, so removing the
 * fraction guard entirely changed no answer anywhere. The engine reads `aspect-16/9` as `[41]#1`,
 * and adding the probes turned a table row that silently declined into a measured one.
 *
 * `-lg/none` for the same reason: `none` is the one modifier that resolves through the theme (a
 * `--leading` key, so `text-lg/none` sets a line height), and with no probe carrying it, emptying
 * `themedModifierValues` changed no answer here on any theme.
