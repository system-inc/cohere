/*
 * Extract the descriptor table, and prove it against the engine.
 *
 * The architecture of the Go port rests on one claim: a utility root's reading — `{order, count}`,
 * the only thing `getPropertySort` computes — is a pure function of the inferred data type of its
 * value. If that holds, `utilities.ts` (6,827 lines, most of it computing values nobody reads)
 * collapses to a table of a few hundred rows. If it does not, the shape of the port changes.
 *
 * This tool tests the claim before any Go is written, in three passes:
 *
 *   Extract   For every functional root, probe it with every shape, read the engine's answer, and
 *             ask whether the shape's inferred data type determines that answer. The output is
 *             `{root -> {typeList, readingByType, fallback}}` plus every root where it does not.
 *
 *   Replay    Take the extracted descriptors and predict the reading of all ~37,600 classes in the
 *             registry. The registry is the population; a corpus is a sample of what someone
 *             happened to write, and an earlier table built from a corpus missed nine families.
 *
 *   Sweep     Predict the reading of every root x every shape, ~166,000 probes, which is the part
 *             that reaches values no registry contains.
 *
 * Three controls, because a sweep that predicts everything is exactly what a broken sweep looks
 * like:
 *
 *   A planted dirty descriptor, which the harness must flag. A check that has never returned a
 *   positive has not been shown to be able to.
 *
 *   Volume assertions. 37,643 classes and six figures of probes are the expected magnitudes; a run
 *   reporting far fewer measured the wrong thing and its clean result means nothing.
 *
 *   A null count, reported separately and never scored as agreement. In the ahra corpus 10 of 1,208
 *   distinct classes return no reading at all, and counting those as passes would be blindest on
 *   exactly the classes most likely to break.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   node internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_descriptors/extract.mjs <theme.css> [--json <path>]

 * registry classes, 301 functional roots, six figures of sweep probes, a full property order and a
 * proven planted control. That run was measured, and it passed. What it lacks is the `@utility` and
 * `@theme` content that makes a design system per-repository at all, which is precisely what the
 * table generated from it would claim to describe.
 *
 * This is the same defect a219c8f found in the candidate parser's own volume assertion, and it is
 * the bug this whole port exists to fix pointing the other way: a table describing one repository
 * while claiming to describe Tailwind, and a generator describing bare Tailwind while claiming to
 * describe a repository, are one error with two signs. Both look completely clean in the summary.
 *
 * Counted, not named. The floors are 1 because the honest claim is "this system contributes
 * something of its own", and any number above that is a fact about one repository rather than about
 * repositories: ahra contributes 35 roots and 325 theme keys, the independent fixture contributes 2
 * and 4, and both are legitimate design systems. A floor tuned to ahra would refuse the fixture.
