 * The engine's answers, for the Go lookup to be measured against.
 *
 * The Go test needs three things per case and nothing else: the class, the parse the lookup would
 * receive, and the `{order, count}` the engine produced. It deliberately does not store parse trees
 * or intermediate values. That restraint is the point rather than a preference: an earlier fixture
 * in this slice reached 6.5 MB by storing trees it did not need, and the trees made it no more able
 * to fail.
 *
 * The parse is included because `internal/tailwind`'s candidate parser (#bg0t9tb) is a separate task
 * and the descriptor lookup must be testable without it. Carrying the engine's own parse means a
 * lookup failure is a lookup failure rather than a parser failure wearing its clothes, which is what
 * lets this suite report on the model rather than on the sum of two ports.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   node internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_descriptor_table/fixtures.mjs <theme.css> [--limit N] [--resolve-root <dir>] > fixtures.json

 * Reduction by lookup path, because 104,220 cases hold 5,353 distinct ones.
 *
 * The full population is generated and then reduced rather than sampled, so the reduction is a
 * measurement of redundancy rather than a guess about which cases matter. The first run of this tool
 * wrote 39 MB: the registry is 37,643 classes and most of them walk the same path, since every
 * `--color` key on `bg` proves exactly what the first one proved.
 *
 * The signature is what the lookup actually branches on: the root, the value's kind and annotation,
 * the modifier axis, and the reading produced. Two cases with the same signature cannot disagree in
 * the Go port unless they also disagree in the engine, and if they do, the reading is in the
 * signature and they are kept.
 *
 * Bare values need more than the signature, and less than all of them.
 *
 * Their path runs through the theme-namespace scan, so which *key* was written decides which
 * namespace claimed it, and that is invisible to a reading-based signature: `font-bold` and
 * `font-serif` share one and are exactly the pair that separates the two precedence orderings that
 * refinement 2 exists to pin. But keeping every named value keeps 37,643 registry classes to prove
 * something the first few keys of each namespace already prove, which is how the first run of this
 * tool wrote 39 MB.
 *
 * So a bare case is kept per (root, claiming namespace), plus a fixed number of distinct keys from
 * each, rather than per key. The claiming namespace is computed here with the engine's own key sets
 * in the engine's own longest-first order, which is the same scan the Go lookup runs. That makes the
 * kept population "every way a bare value can resolve on every root" instead of "every value", and
 * it is the difference between a corpus that measures the model and one that measures the theme.
