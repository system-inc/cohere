/*
 * The parts of the descriptor table that are not readings.
 *
 * `extract.mjs` measures readings and is the tool that proved the model; it is left untouched. Four
 * things the Go lookup needs are not readings and so are not in its output, and they are collected
 * here from the same design system by the same loader:
 *
 *   - `namespaces`, longest first. The order is the precedence the engine applies and it is part of
 *     the contract rather than a presentation choice: `--drop-shadow` must be tested before
 *     `--shadow`, or `drop-shadow-lg` resolves through the wrong one.
 *
 *   - `keysByNamespace`, which is what decides whether a bare value is a theme key at all. This is
 *     the per-repository half of the table, and it is why the table is generated rather than
 *     committed.
 *
 *   - `propertyOrder`, needed only to turn an arbitrary property such as `[font:inherit]` into an
 *     index. It is read out of the bundle as a plain string array rather than derived by asking the
 *     engine to sort one utility per property, because that route only reaches properties some
 *     utility declares alone: the same comment in `generate_collapse/enumerate.mjs` records it
 *     finding 254 of 359 and shifting every index after a missing one.
 *
 *   - `perDeclarationRoots`, the roots whose arity is the count of surviving `@utility` declarations
 *     rather than a function of any data type. These are the 18 known registry exceptions, and the
 *     table has to know which roots it cannot answer so the lookup can decline instead of guessing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   node internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_descriptor_table/context.mjs <theme.css> [--resolve-root <dir>] > context.json

 * than one path at once. `slide-in-from-top-50` survives two declarations because `50` is both an
 * `integer` and a `--percentage-*` key; `slide-in-from-top-4` survives one.

 * and with one that is also a theme key, and a root whose count changes between them is resolving
 * per declaration. This finds the roots rather than naming them, so a repository that adds another
 * `@utility` of the same shape is covered without editing this file, and a repository that has none
