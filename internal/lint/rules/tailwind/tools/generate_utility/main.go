// Command generate_utility captures what the shipped Tailwind engine does with a repository's
// own `@utility` blocks, so that the Go evaluator in internal/lint/rules/tailwind/collapse/utility.go is tested against
// measurements rather than against a reading of `createCssUtility`.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_utility -theme <theme.css> [-output <file.json>] [-check]
//
// The population is chosen so that a clean result is evidence rather than a coincidence, which for
// this component is not a rhetorical concern: the mechanism it ports was predicted by the
// architecture analysis and then confirmed at scale by Phase 0, so the answer was known before the
// Go was written and a suite that only confirmed it would have proved nothing about the Go.
//
// Two halves, and both are load-bearing:
//
//   - The repository half, which is the registry classes on `@utility` roots plus a shape sweep. It
//     covers the 18 known exceptions exactly as generate_descriptors reported them, and the
//     exception set is read out of that tool's own report rather than re-derived here. A first
//     attempt did re-derive it with a proxy and got 30 instead of 18, because `<root>-full` also
//     resolves through two paths and the descriptor model answers it correctly.
//
//   - The synthetic half, small standalone design systems reaching branches the repository's blocks
//     never do: `--value(percentage)` and its integer guard, `--modifier(…)` and the post-conditions
//     that gate it, `--default(…)`, and quoted literals. Each was found by mutating the Go and
//     watching nothing fail. Without them, four ported branches have coverage in the diff and
//     nothing behind it.
//
// Running the repository half invokes generate_descriptors, which takes several minutes. That is
// the right place to pay for the exception set being defined by the tool that measured it.
//
// `-check` regenerates and fails when the committed fixture disagrees, which is what makes a
// Tailwind upgrade that changes utility evaluation show up as a failing gate instead of a silent
// behavior change. Like the other internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_* tools, nothing invokes it automatically.
//
// Node is required to run it and never to use the result.
