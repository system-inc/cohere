// Command generate_collapse regenerates the Tailwind collapse table from the installed Tailwind.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_collapse -entry-point <theme.css> [-output <file.go>] [-check]
//	    [-resolve-root <dir>] [-verify-invariance-against <theme.css>[:<resolve-root>]]
//
// # The one invariance claim in this file, and how to re-measure it
//
// `CollapseFamilies` ships as a fact about Tailwind. Everything else this generator writes is a
// per-repository extraction, and `KnownStatics` proves it by carrying `markdown-content`, one of
// ahra's own `@utility` blocks.
//
// That claim was first verified by generating against ~/Projects/ahra and
// ~/Projects/connected/www-connected-app and diffing to zero. The instrument could not support the
// conclusion: both vendor the Structure submodule and import its `global.css`, so they share its
// `@theme` and `@utility` blocks and are one observation wearing two names. Re-measured against a
// system sharing nothing, the claim does hold — the same 44 families, identical down to the value
// each was discovered at, across a registry differing by 25 functional roots and 7,850 probed
// pairs. `-verify-invariance-against` is that measurement made repeatable, and it refuses a second
// system whose registry matches the first, since two systems that cannot differ cannot detect a
// table that varies.
//
//	go run ./internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_collapse \
//	    -entry-point ~/Projects/ahra/app/_theme/styles/theme.css \
//	    -verify-invariance-against internal/lint/rules/tailwind/tools/generate_descriptor_base/testdata/independent_theme.css:tools/tailwind/generate_descriptor_base/testdata
//
// `-resolve-root` is what makes that second path work at all. Bare specifiers such as `tailwindcss`
// used to resolve from the entry point's own directory, which is correct for every repository and
// impossible for a design system checked in under `tools/` with no `node_modules` above it. The two
// are separate inputs now, defaulting to the old behaviour.
//
// The table it writes is what lets `enforce-canonical-classes` run in Go without a JavaScript engine
// at lint time. Tailwind's own collapse logic is a signature-equivalence search over the whole
// utility registry, eight to ten thousand lines that change every minor release. Porting the search
// was rejected twice for that reason. Porting its answers is a different proposition: 327 functional
// roots produce 53,301 pairs, of which 38 collapse, and the families are facts about roots rather
// than computations per class.
//
// The generator exists so that staleness is visible instead of silent. Today a Tailwind upgrade can
// change what collapses and nobody finds out, because the only way to notice is a finding that stops
// being reported. With a generated table, an upgrade produces a diff in a checked-in file, which a
// human reads in review. `-check` makes that a gate: it regenerates and fails if either committed
// table disagrees, so a version bump that changes the answers cannot land quietly.
//
// It writes two files, and `-check` covers both. `collapse_table.go` is what
// `enforce-canonical-classes` reads; `property_order_table.go` is what
// `enforce-consistent-class-order` reads. The check used to return before the second was rendered,
// so one generated file was gated and the other was written by every normal run and compared by
// nothing, under a message naming only the file it had actually read.
//
// Nothing invokes `-check` automatically yet. It is a manual gate, which is worth knowing before
// trusting that an upgrade would have been caught.
//
// Node is required to run it and never to use the result. The enumeration asks the real Tailwind
// engine, because a hand-maintained table is a guess and the guesses have been wrong: an earlier
// attempt enumerated from the classes this codebase happens to use and missed nine families.
