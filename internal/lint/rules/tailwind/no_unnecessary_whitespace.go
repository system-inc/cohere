// The defect is cosmetic in the browser and not cosmetic in the repository. Class strings are the
// one part of the codebase with no compiler, so the only way anyone finds them is by reading and
// searching text. Two literals meaning the same list should be the same bytes, otherwise a search
// for one spelling misses the other, a diff shows a change where nothing changed, and the reviewer
// spends attention on whitespace instead of on the classes.
//
// Runs over every static run of class text, which for a template means each piece between the
// interpolations. That is what makes it safe next to a hole: whitespace adjacent to an interpolation
// is load-bearing, because it is the only thing keeping the substituted value from fusing with the
// class beside it. Measured against upstream: `flex  ${x}` becomes `flex ${x}`, keeping exactly one
// space, and never `flex${x}`.
//
// A class list written across lines keeps its lines. Upstream's `allowMultiline` is on by default,
// and with it a run holding a newline loses only the spaces before the newline. This rule used to
// shorten every run to its first character and drop the runs at the edges, which flattened a
// multi-line template literal to one line and left a doubled tab as a tab where upstream writes one
// space. Read from upstream 4.7.0's source when the option was ported (#gj5nm6e), and corrected to it.
//
// Fixable and safe to fix unattended, because the repair is defined entirely by what the string
// already says. Whitespace-only becomes empty, matching upstream, rather than being deleted: the
// attribute is the author's and this rule has no opinion about whether it should exist.

//
//   - A segment of nothing but whitespace, with no hole on either side, loses all of it.
//   - With allowMultiline, a run holding a newline loses only the spaces in front of the newline,
//     and keeps the newline and the indentation after it. This comes before the edge cases, so a
//     class list that opens and closes on its own lines keeps them.
//   - Between two classes, or at an edge with a hole beside it, a run longer than one character
//     becomes one space. Shortened, never synthesized: `px-${size}` has no whitespace at the hole and
//     gets none, since inventing one would turn `px-4` into two class names.
//   - At an outer edge with no hole beside it, the run goes.
//
// A hole beside a run is upstream's braces for a template's own text, and the edge rule
// `holeEdges` computes for a string inside another template's hole, which upstream reads as a plain
// string and trims, fusing `flex${open ? ' block' : ""}` into `flexblock`. Keeping one space there is
// deliberate; see holeEdges.
//
// Lengths count characters as upstream's JavaScript does, and every character isSpace accepts is one
// byte, so a byte length is that count.
