// The failure this catches is silent by construction. An unknown class generates no CSS, so nothing
// errors, the element renders, and the style it was meant to apply is simply absent. There is no
// compiler for class names, which is why lint is the only layer that can see this at all.
//
// # Existence is a different question from what a class declares
//
// Every other rule in this package asks what a class sets. This one asks whether it exists, and
// answering it from the property tables is wrong in the direction that reports correct code.
// `from-black/70` sets only `--tw-gradient-from`, `container` emits several rules, and `fade-in`
// sets only `--enter-opacity`; all three are deliberately absent from those tables and all three are
// real. Measured on the ahra tree, that mistake produced 12 findings on valid classes.
//
// So existence is asked of the design system rather than of a table. See class_existence.go: the
// question is whether the repository in front of the linter can read the class as a candidate, which
// is the only form of the question that answers correctly for a repository this port has never seen.
// Absence from a properties table is not evidence a class does not exist, and presence in a
// generated one is not evidence that it does.
//
// # What it deliberately does not check
//
// A known root with an unknown value is not reported. `w-notavalue` has root `w` and does not
// compile, and catching it would need the theme's per-root value scales plus the arbitrary-value
// grammar, which is closer to reimplementing the utility resolver than to reading a table.
//
// That is a real gap and it is the safe direction: this rule catches every typo'd utility name and
// every stray class, and misses a typo'd value on a real root. Under-reporting leaves a defect for
// someone to find later; over-reporting on correct code is how a rule gets turned off, and this rule
// in particular gets turned off the first time it flags a working class.
