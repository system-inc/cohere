// The Tailwind fixers compose: a shuffled, duplicated, badly spaced literal reaches the plugin's text
// through the real edit engine, in a bounded number of passes, with nothing refused.
//
// Each fixer used to rewrite the whole literal, so on one literal only one of them landed per pass and
// the rest were refused as overlapping: 6,847 refusals on the perturbed ahra corpus and 8,517 on
// www-phi-health (#vf1hd6j), every one landing a pass later. Now each edits only its own bytes
// (class_tokens.go). The order rule waits for the repeat to go, so the shape is two passes that land
// and a third that finds nothing.
//
// The wanted text is what Prettier's Tailwind plugin wrote for the same input, run on 2026-10-02 with
// ahra's pinned prettier-plugin-tailwindcss 0.8.1 and its own theme.css:
//
//	"  items-center flex p-2 flex   peer  "  ->  "peer flex items-center p-2"
//
// Mutation check, run when this was written: putting `no-unnecessary-whitespace` back to rewriting
// its whole segment turns this red with overlap refusals against `no-duplicate-classes`.
