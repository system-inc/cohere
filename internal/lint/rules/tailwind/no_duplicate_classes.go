// from one with nothing to say.

//	invalid: mergeClassNames('px-4 py-2 px-4')
//
// The defect is small and the reason to catch it is not. A repeated class does nothing at runtime,
// so nothing ever surfaces it: it survives every review, renders correctly, and accumulates. Its
// cost is that it makes the string a worse record of intent. The second `flex` is evidence that two
// edits met in the middle without either author seeing the other, and the next person to change
// that literal inherits the ambiguity about which one is load-bearing.
//
// Reads all three surfaces the configuration names, not just JSX attributes. On the ahra tree that
// is 7,773 attribute literals against 2,192 in callees and variables, so an attribute-only rule
// would cover 78% of the class surface while printing green over the rest.
//
// Fixable, and safe to fix unattended: removing a later duplicate cannot change what the string
// means, because CSS class order carries no meaning of its own. Ordering is
// `enforce-consistent-class-order`'s concern and is left alone here.
//
// The name deliberately matches the upstream rule's, without a `tailwind-` prefix. Config lookup
// resolves a bare name against a namespaced entry on a `/` boundary, so `no-duplicate-classes`
// answers to the `better-tailwindcss/no-duplicate-classes` line the project already has. A prefixed
// name would not match it, and an unmatched rule is not an error: it runs over zero files and
// reports zero findings, which reads exactly like a clean tree. That was the first thing this rule
// did, and only the coverage line's "listened to no files" note caught it.
