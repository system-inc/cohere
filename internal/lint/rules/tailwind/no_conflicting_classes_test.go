// # Why every fixture here runs through a program
//
// Same reason the other three migrated rules' fixtures give. The rule now reads the live design
// system to resolve a class to its declared properties, so it declares `ReadsProgram` and returns
// nil listeners when the Program is nil. `rule_testing.Run` hands it exactly that, so a fixture left on
// it would exercise the nil-Program branch: the reporting half fails loudly and the silent half —
// which this rule's own header calls the load-bearing one — passes while proving nothing.
//
// `TestConflictFixturesActuallyRan` is what stops the converted file from going green on nothing in
// the other direction, where the walk for an installed tailwindcss finds none and every fixture
// skips while `go test` prints ok.

// runConflictFixture runs the rule against a one-file program that has a real design system.
//
// The fixture stylesheet declares no tokens of its own. This rule's subject is what a class declares,
// and the classes these fixtures use are the framework's, so a fixture theme adding tokens would test
// the fixture. The repository half is measured against the real corpus in live_placement_test.go,
// where 913 class occurrences are answered by compiling an `@utility` block.
