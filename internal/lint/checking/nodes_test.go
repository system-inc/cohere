// TestCommentRangeFactoryStaysUntouched holds what lets every GetCommentsInRange call share one
// factory: the scanner writes nothing to it. It scans trailing and leading comments of both kinds
// through the shared factory, checks they were all found, and then that the factory is still the
// zero value. If the scanner ever starts counting or pooling on its factory, this fails, and the
// sharing has to become one factory per caller.
