// Package rule_testing runs a rule against source text and reports what it found.
//
// Every rule in cohere ships a fixture pair: source that must produce a finding, and source that
// must produce none. Both directions, always, in the same commit as the rule.
//
// That is not ceremony. During the migration this tool replaces, a class-name filter that measured
// fifteen times faster silently stopped reporting one real collapse, and a hand-written identifier
// splitter silently stopped reporting another. Both were caught by fixtures. Neither was caught by
// reading the diff. The inverse defect, a rule that fires on correct code, had no guard at all,
// because the corpus was violations only.
//
// A rule that has never been shown to fire has not been shown to work.
