// `zz_` is the dominant one and it is not arbitrary: Go runs tests in file order within a package,
// so a leading `zz` sorts a probe last, and an agent measuring something wants its probe to run
// after the real fixtures rather than among them. Several arrived at that independently in one
// night.

// Narrow on purpose, and narrower than the first version of this list. That version included
// `scratch`, and the first run flagged this file and its sibling guard, both of which are named for
// the thing they refuse. A guard that cannot survive its own name is measuring the wrong property,
// so the word is gone rather than exempted: an exemption would have hidden a real over-match behind
// a special case, and the next file named for what it guards would have tripped it again.
//
// What remains matches a measurement rather than a subject. A real test named for what it does will
// not contain `probe`, `counterfactual`, or `_measure_`, and if one ever legitimately does, an
// exemption below is a decision somebody makes on purpose.

// TestNoScratchFilesRemain refuses a throwaway test file left inside a shipped package.
//
// This is the file-shaped sibling of TestNoScratchPackagesRemain, and it exists because that guard
// cannot see this violation. It globs directories under `internal/rules`, so it is blind twice over:
// to a stray file inside an otherwise real package, which is the more common shape by far, and to
// every tree outside `internal/rules` -- `internal/utilities/hir` held five scratch files in one night
// and no guard could have named them.
//
// A directory-shaped check cannot see a file-shaped violation. That sentence is the whole reason
// this file exists, and it came from a sibling domain noticing the same class in its own tree.
//
// The cost is smaller than the package case but real. A `zz_` probe carries an agent's private
// measurement helpers, compiles into the package, and runs on every `go test ./...` any other agent
// runs. It is not a failure that names someone else's work, which is what made the package version
// urgent; it is clutter that reads as coverage. A reader counting tests in a package cannot tell a
// probe from a fixture without opening it.
//
// Measured when this was written: one match across `internal`, `tools` and `cmd`, and that match is
// the exempted shipped package. The control is 343 real test files found by the same walk, so a
// clean result here is a measurement rather than a search that examined nothing.

	// The first version ran always, and within a minute of being written it went red on two live
	// probes belonging to an agent that was mid-measurement in `internal/utilities/hir`. Those files
	// genuinely should not ship, so the finding was true -- and a guard that is true and fires
	// during ordinary work is a guard people learn to scroll past. The package-shaped sibling avoids
	// this only by accident: scratch packages are rare, scratch files are the common shape, so the
	// same design is quiet there and deafening here.
	//
	// So it runs where it is actionable: before a commit, when a probe left behind is about to
	// become permanent. `VERIFY_CHECK_SCRATCH=1 go test ./internal/registry/` is the invocation, and
	// the commit path sets it. Everywhere else it says why it did not run, so a reader never mistakes
