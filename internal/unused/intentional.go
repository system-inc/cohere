// codebase with two suppression vocabularies makes people guess and guessing wrong is silent.
//
// # Why a marker exists at all
//
// Some exports are unused on purpose: a public API surface, something held for an external consumer,
// work parked deliberately. Without a way to record that decision, the report is re-derived from
// scratch on every reading — the same twenty lines, the same four already-judged, and the reader has
// to remember which four. A report that cannot be answered gets read twice and abandoned, so the
// marker is not a convenience, it is what makes a second reading cheaper than the first.
//
// It changes the summary rather than hiding the line: `18 unused, 4 declared intentional` is a
// different statement from `18 unused`, and collapsing the two would lose the fact that somebody
// looked. A marked export stays countable and stays visible under `--unused-all`.

// intentionalReason is the text a person wrote after the marker, if any.
//
// A bare marker is accepted, because demanding a reason produces reasons like "needed" that cost
// keystrokes and carry nothing. But the reason is reported where present, since the whole value of
// the marker on a second reading is the sentence that says why.
