// FindUnreachable reports the statements in one file that control cannot arrive at.

// It builds one control-flow graph per code path root — the file itself, each function, each class
// static block, each property initializer — because that is the unit the graph is defined over. A
// statement is reported when it is laid out in a block whose Reachable is false.
//
// # Why this leans on the graph rather than pattern-matching a `return`
//
// The naive version looks for a statement following a `return` in the same block and is wrong in
// both directions. It misses `if (x) { return; } else { return; } here();`, where nothing directly
// precedes `here()` in its own block, and it fires on `while (true) { break; } here();`, where the
// break makes the statement after the loop reachable rather than dead. The graph already decides
// both, and correctly: measured on this substrate, both shapes answer as they should.
//
// # What the graph is trusted for, measured rather than assumed
//
// `Block.Reachable`'s doc claims code after an abrupt exit is laid out in unreachable blocks rather
// than dropped, so a consumer's hooks still run there. That claim is the whole basis of this
// function, and it was probed on this substrate before anything was built on it — after `return`,
// after `throw`, after `break`, after `continue`, both-branches-return, and the `do…while` shape the
// vendoring report flagged as a known deviation. All eight answered as documented.

	// # The duplicate-layout trap, measured on this substrate
	//
	// The CFG lays a `finally` block out TWICE — once for normal completion, once for the path that
	// leaves the `try` through `return`, `throw`, or a suspended `yield`. Both copies carry the same
	// source positions, and the second copy is unreachable exactly when nothing takes the abrupt
	// path. So `try { return 1; } finally { beta(); }` puts `beta()` in a reachable block AND in an
	// unreachable one, and a scan that reports any statement found in an unreachable block condemns
	// a `finally` body that certainly runs.
	//
	// This was not hypothetical and not caught by reading: it was a live false positive that the
	// silent-half fixtures caught on the first run. The same shape appears for a `catch` body when
	// the `try` returns — `try { return 1; } catch (e) { gamma(); } finally {...}` lays `gamma()` out
	// unreachable, and that catch is reachable code.
