// those as three unrelated findings in three places. Grouping them says the thing a reader actually
// needs to know: this is one abandoned direction, and here is all of it.

// closure computes what is alive by marking the roots and propagating along reference edges until
// nothing changes.
//
// # What a root is
//
// Three things, and getting any of them wrong is the failure mode that matters:
//
//   - A reference from module top level. Its referrer is nil, which the index records as a genuine
//     root rather than as an absent edge. Module-level code runs when the module loads, so anything
//     it touches is alive.
//   - Every declaration in a file the root set spares. A Next.js `page.tsx` is loaded by the
//     framework with no import anywhere, so its exports and everything they reach are alive.
//   - Every declaration whose referrer is a symbol this inventory never saw. A reference from a
//     `.d.ts`, from a node_modules file, or from a construct this analysis does not model produces
//     a referrer with no record, and treating that as dead would condemn code on the strength of a
//     gap in our own inventory.
//
// # Why this is opt-in
//
// The transitive claim is strictly stronger than the flat one and it FAILS DIFFERENTLY. A wrong
// root in the flat report mis-reports one file. A wrong root here cascades: everything that was
// alive only through that root goes dark at once, and the report gets dramatically bigger in a way
// that looks like a discovery rather than like a bug. Keeping the flat view as the default means
// both numbers can be read against each other, and a reader who has seen them agree on the shape of
// the tree can then trust the bigger one. That is worth one flag.
//
// # Convergence
//
// A worklist rather than a repeat-until-stable sweep, so termination is structural rather than
// hoped for: a symbol is pushed only on the transition from unmarked to marked, so each is pushed at
// most once and the loop is bounded by the number of declarations. There is no fixpoint to miss and
// no pass count to tune. The pass count is reported anyway — as the longest chain the marking
// followed — because that number is the one that says whether the graph is deep or the closure quit
// early.
