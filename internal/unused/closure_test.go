//
// The closure does not do this. It has no reachability input at all -- `closure.go` contains no
// mention of reachability, and `Unreachable` is a report field that is collected and printed and
// never read back into the reference walk. `roots.go`'s own header says the two questions are
// "separable on purpose", which is exactly right about the design and is why the JUDGMENT entry
// describing the closure as consuming one of them cannot be true.
//
// The fixture is built so reachability is the ONLY difference. Both constants are imported by the
// same file, each referenced exactly once, from two exported functions that a framework-spared page
// calls. If the claim held, `ReachedOnlyAfterReturn` would be reported and `ReachedNormally` spared.
// Both are spared.
//
// Written as a test asserting what the code DOES rather than what the comment says it does, and the
