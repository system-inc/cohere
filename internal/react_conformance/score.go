// distinguish a right answer from a wrong one. Nothing implements it yet, which is the point: the

// An implementation that cannot handle a fixture returns ErrUnsupported rather than an empty

//
// Only the first line of the message, because the golden's remaining paragraphs are prose carrying
// react.dev URLs. Upstream edits them for clarity without touching compiler behaviour, and a runner
// asserting on the full block would report a rule regression for a documentation change. This is
// what upstream's own `RustBackendComparison-test.ts` asserts on for the same reason.
//
// Line but not column, because the caret span in the golden is rendered from a byte offset into a
// source excerpt, and reproducing the exact column requires agreeing with upstream's span
// convention for every node kind before any rule exists to disagree about. Line is the coarser
// claim and it is the one that can be met honestly today. Columns are parsed and carried on
// ExpectedError so a later pass can tighten this without re-reading the corpus.
//
// Unordered, because diagnostic emission order follows pass order in the pipeline, and requiring a
// Go port to match Rust pass ordering would fail correct implementations for a reason unrelated to
// correctness. Multiset rather than set, because 87 of the 325 expect more than one error and
