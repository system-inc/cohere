// UpstreamSha is the facebook/react commit the vendored corpus was taken from.

// The `## Error` expectations are prose. They carry react.dev URLs and multi-paragraph guidance,
// and they change without notice, so a corpus that tracks `main` would rewrite the scoreboard under
// the implementation and call the movement progress. Pinning makes an upstream change a diff a
// human reads rather than a number that drifts.

//
// The number that moved last time and the reason the vendoring tool refuses a path-anchored filter:
// a research pass reported 221 by grepping the fixture root, which missed the nine subdirectories
// holding 103 of them. Wrong by a third, and it read exactly like a clean result.
const ExpectedErrorFixtureCount = 325

// ExpectedCleanFixtureCount is how many fixtures carrying the preserve-memoization pragma expect no
// error at all.
//
// These are the only population where silence is the correct answer and a finding is a defect, which
// makes them the sole false-positive oracle in the corpus. Their absence was not upstream's doing:
// `Load` rejected every fixture not named `error.*`, so the tree was error-only by construction and
// the resulting inability to measure over-reporting was attributed to upstream for hours.
//
// Asserted exactly rather than as a floor, because the failure that produced the wrong number could
// not be caught by one. Collecting these by copying them into a single directory loses any whose
// basenames collide, and four do -- `optional-member-expression-single.js` and three siblings exist
// in more than one subdirectory. That collection returned 66, wrote no error, and the four losses
// were invisible.

// each other: a run that lost four clean fixtures and gained four error ones would hold a correct
// total and a wrong corpus.

// rather than a skip -- see the `flow` entry in ignoredPragmas.

	// how a wrong interpretation gets baked in before anything can contradict it.

// UnknownPragmaError reports a directive the runner does not model.
//
// This is an error rather than a skip on purpose, and the reason is the whole point of the type.
//
// A pragma reconfigures what a fixture expects. `@validateRefAccessDuringRender` turns a validation
// on; without it the same source is legal and the expectation is wrong. So an unmodelled directive
// does not make a fixture merely unrunnable, it makes the fixture's verdict *unrelated to the
// implementation being scored* — and a runner that skips it reports "not applicable" for a case it
// silently got wrong, while a runner that ignores it reports a pass or a fail it has not earned.
//
// Upstream demonstrates the failure rather than merely permitting it. `parseConfigPragmaForTests`
// in `Utils/TestUtils.ts` reads:
//
//	for (const {key, value: val} of splitPragma(pragma)) {
//	  if (!hasOwnProperty(defaultOptions, key)) {
//	    continue;
//	  }
//
// and `parseConfigPragmaEnvironmentForTest` has the identical `continue` against
// `EnvironmentConfigSchema.shape`. Both drop an unrecognised key without a word. Measured against
// the 325 error fixtures at the pinned sha, six distinct directives in active use fall through
// those two `continue`s: `@skip`, `@flow`, `@enableFlowSuppressions`, `@enableNewMutationAliasingModel`,
// `@enablePropagateDepsInHIR`, and `@compilationMode(infer)` — the last because `splitPragma` splits
// values on `:` only, so the parenthesised spelling yields the key `compilationMode(infer)`, which
// matches nothing. `@skip` is the sharpest of them: it is not read anywhere in `packages/snap`, so
// eight fixtures carry an instruction that has never done anything.
//
// Refusing is cheap here and silence is not. A refusal is one line naming the directive and the
// file; a silent skip is a green suite over a corpus a third of which was never scored.
