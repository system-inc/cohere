// platform Go cannot build.

// That was measured, not supposed. Adding `plan9/sparc64` to `Targets` passed the entire suite, and
// a release would then have failed at the first cross-compilation of a platform we told npm we
// support. A field nobody derives drifts toward whatever was easiest to write.
