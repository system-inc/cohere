// Package gocache bounds a Go build cache by size, which Go itself never does.
//
// Go trims its cache only of entries unused for five days, checked once a day. Building and testing
// cohere fills it far faster than that: on 2026-10-03 the default cache regrew 223 GB in nine hours and
// filled the disk, and the launcher's private one had reached 310 GB that morning (#3sgjy0h, #bdw0dhn).
// Trim is Go's own trim with the age chosen by size instead of fixed: it removes the entries used least
// recently until the cache is under a target, so what a build reaches for next survives and nothing has to
// start cold.

// InUseWindow is how recently used an entry may be and still be one a running build is about to read, and

// looked up a minute ago can carry a time 59 minutes old; the last half hour covers that build still
// running. Inside the hour, age cannot tell an entry nobody wants from one a build is reading, and the
// disk's access times cannot either, since a read updates them at most once a day. Removing one a build
// is reading fails that build with "could not import ... no such file", which reads as a compile error:
// the #3sgjy0h gate did exactly that when it trimmed young entries to hold a burst under the cap. So a
// burst can stand above the cap by what it wrote inside the window, and it never breaks a build.
