package release

// SwiftEngineFileName is the Swift engine's executable in a platform package, in `bin/` beside cohere's
// own. The release puts it there and a released cohere looks for it there and nowhere else, so both read
// this one spelling.

// ShipsSwiftEngine reports whether a platform's package carries the Swift engine.
//
// macOS only. The engine links the toolchain's libraries and reads its compiler's serialized
// diagnostics, so it ships where Xcode does. On every other platform cohere refuses a Swift package by
// name rather than checking nothing, and the release stages no engine there.
