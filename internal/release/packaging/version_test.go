/*
 * The binary names the commit it was built from, on its own line.
 *
 * `Version` reads "dev" for every local build, which says nothing about which rules the binary
 * holds. Every measurement taken with it is reproducible only if it can name its own vintage, and
 * two numbers taken from binaries at different commits look exactly like a contradiction: that
 * happened today between me and `@system`, where 287 and 217 were both true and three graph repairs
 * had landed in between.
 *
 * The revision was already in the binary. Go's linker stamps `vcs.revision` on any build inside a
 * version-controlled tree, and `resolveCompilerCommit` was already reading it. It surfaced only
 * inside the compiler line's fallback text, under a label a reader asking "which cohere is this"
 * would not look at.
 *
 * The empty case is the load-bearing half. A build outside a repository, or with `-buildvcs=false`,
 * carries no stamp, and printing "unknown" there would read as a lost stamp rather than a build
 * that never had one. Absent evidence is not evidence.
