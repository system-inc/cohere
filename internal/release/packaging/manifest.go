// PackageScope is the npm scope every cohere package publishes under.
//
// A scope rather than a bare name because the bare name is not ours: `cohere` is published on npm
// by someone else, and so was `verify` before it. Two bare names taken in a row is the evidence that
// a scope is the durable answer rather than a fallback. `@system-inc` matches the repository at
// `github.com/system-inc/cohere`, and it is the name Structure already tells a consumer to install.
const PackageScope = "@system-inc"

// UnscopedDispatcherPackageName is the dispatcher's name inside the scope.
//
// It is also the directory the dispatcher is staged in, so a staged release reads the same way
// `node_modules/@system-inc/` does, and the stem every platform package's name begins with.
const UnscopedDispatcherPackageName = "cohere"

// ShortCommandName is what a consumer types on the loop they sit in all day.
//
// One letter, because the whole argument of this tool is that verification stops being a thing you
// do and becomes a property the codebase has. A command run after every edit should cost as little
// to type as it costs to run, and six keystrokes charged on that loop is a real toll.
const ShortCommandName = "c"

// FullCommandName is the same command under the name that reads in a script.
//
// Both names are installed, pointing at the same launcher, which costs nothing: npm's `bin` is a
// map from command name to file, so two entries are two symlinks onto one entry point rather than
// one command wrapping another. There is no extra process and no measurable difference between
// them.
//
// Having both retires the one real objection to a single letter. `v` is short enough to collide
// with something already on a given machine, and a consumer who hits that keeps a working command
// rather than a broken install. It is also the name that belongs in continuous integration, in
// documentation, and in a script somebody reads a year from now, where brevity buys nothing and
// saying what it does buys everything.
const FullCommandName = "cohere"

// launcherRelativePath is where the launcher sits inside the dispatcher package.
//
// Declared once because the manifest's `bin` entries and the build that writes the file have to
// agree exactly. A package whose bin points at a path the build never wrote installs successfully
// and produces a command that does not exist, which is a failure the install itself will not
// report.
//
// Named for the full command rather than the short one: the file is the thing, and `v` is a name
// for it.
const launcherRelativePath = "bin/" + FullCommandName

// RepositoryURL is where the source lives, recorded in every published package. In npm's own form,
// git+https with .git, because npm rewrites any other spelling at publish time and warns about it on
// every package, which buries the warnings that matter.

// PlatformManifest is the package.json for one platform's binary package.
//
// The `os` and `cpu` fields are the entire mechanism. npm and pnpm read them to decide which
// optional dependency to install on this machine, so a package whose fields disagree with its
// contents installs on the wrong platform and produces an exec-format error, or installs nowhere
// and looks like an unsupported platform. They are generated from the same target as the binary,
// rather than written by hand, so the two cannot drift.
