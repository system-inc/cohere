// TestTheDevelopmentHashLandsInCoheresOwnCache pins where the launcher's one plain-file write goes.
//
// `cohere --no-fix` promises to write nothing to the project it checks, and the help text states the
// boundary of that promise as cohere's own `.cache/cohere/`. That boundary is only true while every
// launcher write is placed by Paths rather than by the working directory, so this runs the write from
// inside a stand-in project and asserts two things: the hash is under the module's cache, and the
// project directory is still empty.
//
// A path built relative to the working directory, which is the easy mistake when a file sits "beside"
// a binary, would put it in whatever tree the caller was standing in. That would make the help text
// false while every other launcher test kept passing.
