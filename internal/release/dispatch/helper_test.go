// Measured when this was written: 16 files across 6 rule packages contain no rule declaration at
// all. They are helpers, shared inside one namespace and invisible to every other. `next/attributes.go`
// decides how a JSX attribute is matched; when `react` is ported it will decide again, differently,
// and neither decision will ever be reconciled because both packages pass their own tests.
//
// The house rule is already explicit: two helpers that do almost the same thing is worse than one
// that is slightly the wrong shape, because the drift is permanent.
//
// This test does not fail on a helper existing. A namespace-local helper is often correct, and a
// guard that refused them outright would be worked around within a week. What it refuses is a
// helper whose name matches something the shared utility layer already exports, because that is a

// rather than predicted. Six retrofits landed today; not one of them would have tripped the name
// guard, because the local helpers were called `reportForwardRefImport` and `importsGraphqlSpecifier`
// while the shelf exports `BindingsOf` and `ImportedNameOf`. Nothing collided. The name guard
// catches a second implementation that admits what it is by its name, and the expensive case is
// exactly the one that does not.
//
// The signal it uses instead is the reach itself. A rule calling `AsNamedImports()` is walking past
// a function whose whole purpose is that walk, and that is visible in the source without knowing
// what anybody named their helper.
//
// **It deliberately does not try to detect duplicated judgment in general.** A fourth retrofit today
// fit only halfway: `boundary-no-project-theme-value` had the shelf's two-kind element split spelled
// locally, wrapped around an upward walk from an attribute that is genuinely its own and lives
// nowhere else. A guard claiming to find "a local helper that duplicates a shared one" would have to
// rule on that file, and would be wrong whichever way it ruled. This one asks a narrower question it
// can answer exactly.
//
// An exemption is a comment on the reaching line or the line above it, saying why. That keeps the
// escape hatch in the file that needs it rather than in a list here that nobody reads, and it accepts
