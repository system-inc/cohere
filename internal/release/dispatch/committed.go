// The launcher builds the cohere every project's gate runs from the checkout's committed tree, never
// from its working tree.
//
// The checkout is shared. Several members edit it at once, and until this existed the binary was
// named for a hash of whatever `go list` found on disk, so any member's half-written rule went live in
// every project's gate on the next run. On 2026-10-02 one member's uncommitted reading of nested
// literals turned 22 Tailwind findings on in ahra before anyone had classified the work. The work was
// right; the gate was still running code nobody had committed, which is the honesty doctrine failing
// inside the toolchain that enforces it.
//
// So a gate run builds from a snapshot of HEAD: this repository extracted with `git archive`, and the
// vendored compiler extracted at the commit HEAD pins it to. Nothing in either comes from a working
// tree, the compiler submodule's included. Testing uncommitted work is still possible, and it is
// explicit: `--dev` builds the working tree and says so on every run.
