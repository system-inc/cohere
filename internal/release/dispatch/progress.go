// A default run ends in one footer line, and the launcher's lines would print above it, so each kind says
// only as much as the caller needs:
//
//   - A step, such as building HEAD, extracting the compiler or building the Swift engine, takes seconds
//     to minutes, and silence through that would look hung. On a terminal it is one dim line, rewritten by
//     the next step and cleared before cohere prints, and to a pipe or a file it is nothing.
//   - A note, such as what a prune or a trim removed, is housekeeping already written to the prune log.
//     It prints nowhere.
//   - With --verbose (or --dispatch-verbose) both print in full, one line each, as they always did.
//
// A failure is none of these: it prints as it always did, after clearing a step that was showing.
