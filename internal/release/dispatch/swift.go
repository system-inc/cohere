// ResolveSwiftEngine returns the path to a cohere-swift binary matching the engine's sources and the
// installed toolchain, building it when there is none.
//
// The same bargain Resolve makes for cohere, for the same reason: the rules are compiled in, so a
// stale binary runs old rules and looks exactly like a current one. The hash covers what decides the
// binary, which for Swift is the package's sources and manifests and the toolchain. The toolchain is
// in the hash because the engine links its libraries and reads its compiler's serialized diagnostics,
// so the same sources under a new Xcode are a different engine.
//
// What the hash does not cover is the one bit the manifest reads from git: whether the repository had
// uncommitted changes when the engine was built, which the engine reports as `sourceTreeModified`.
// Asking git on every run would cost more than the rest of the resolve together, and Go's own build
// stamp behaves the same way for the cohere binary. So a binary built from a modified tree goes on
// saying so after the change is committed, until its sources move. That errs toward the warning,
// which is the direction to err.
//
// That is the working-tree half. When commit is not empty the engine is built from that commit
// instead, which is what a gate gets: see resolveCommittedSwiftEngine. The contract is the one the
// caller speaks, used only to ask a freshly built committed engine for its provenance.
