// This file is the aggregation layer: it turns "did this rule reproduce this golden" into a number
// whose categories a reader can act on.
//
// # Why the outcome set in score.go was not enough
//
// `Run` distinguishes Passed, Failed, Declined, Excluded, Refused, which is the right partition for
// an implementation that is either present or absent. It is the wrong partition for the question
// this file answers, because it collapses three facts that have different responses:
//
//   - A rule produced nothing because the fixture never reaches its validator upstream either. The
//     response is nothing; the corpus is not asking the question.
//   - A rule produced nothing because the fixture does not import React, so a type-aware rule reads
//     `any` and is correctly silent. The response is to fix the corpus (a stub) or to accept the
//     gap, but it is not to change the rule.
//   - A rule produced nothing because it deliberately does not carry that diagnostic kind, with the
//     boundary written down and machine-checked. The response is to decide whether to widen scope.
//
// All three read as "failed" under a raw score, and the third is the one that matters: it punishes
// exactly the rules that were most careful about stating their limits. A number that does that is
// worse than no number, because it creates pressure to stop writing the limits down.
//
// # The categories, and what each one commits to
//
// Every category here is a claim that can be wrong, and each is testable. `ProveEachCategoryIsReachable`
// exists because a category that can never be non-empty is not a category, it is a comment.

// Verdict is why one fixture landed where it did, for one rule.

	// VerdictUnreachableFixture means the fixture never reaches this validator upstream either.
	//
	// Measured, not assumed: the fixture's expected diagnostics belong to a DIFFERENT rule than the
	// one being scored. React's pipeline aborts earlier, so the golden records the earlier
	// diagnostic and the rule under test is never consulted. The three fixtures named for
	// error-boundaries are the clearest case — all three expect a `Todo` from BuildHIR, because
	// lowering aborts on a `try` with no `catch`.
	VerdictUnreachableFixture Verdict = "declined: unreachable fixture"

	// VerdictUnresolvableTypes means the fixture cannot resolve `@types/react`.
	//
	// A checker-based rule reads `any` for every hook and is correctly silent. Measured over this
	// corpus: 128 of the 202 hook-using fixtures (63%) never import React. A rule can be right on
	// real code and score zero here, and that is a fact about the corpus rather than the rule.

	// VerdictStatedDivergence means verify deliberately differs, with the boundary written down.
	//
	// Held separate from failure on purpose. `exhaustive-deps` carries 15 of 17 diagnostic kinds
	// with `TestExhaustiveDepsScopeIsStated` naming the eight dropped cases; `set-state-in-effect`
	// pins a ref exemption as a fixture that fails when it is fixed. Those are decisions, and a
	// score that called them failures would be measuring care as if it were error.
	VerdictStatedDivergence Verdict = "excluded: stated divergence"

	// VerdictNoRuleShipped means no rule in verify claims this fixture's diagnostics.
	//
	// Separate from unreachable, because the response is different: unreachable means nobody could
	// score it, this means we have not written the rule yet. Six of upstream's 26 rules are the
	// bulk of the corpus and verify ships none of them.

	// This is the honest name for the state the harness is in today, and it is deliberately NOT
	// folded into any decline. A decline says something about the fixture; this says something
	// about the run. Collapsing it into `unreachable` would claim these fixtures cannot be scored,
