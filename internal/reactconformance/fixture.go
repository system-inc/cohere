// Package reactconformance scores an implementation against React's own compiler error fixtures.
//
// # What this is
//
// React's compiler ships 1,810 expectation files under `fixtures/compiler/`. Each pairs an input
// with a `.expect.md` holding either `## Code` (the transformed output) or `## Error` (the
// diagnostics) — never both, measured at the pinned sha as 1,485 `## Code` plus 325 `## Error`,
// zero overlap and zero neither. The 325 error goldens are plain text: a message, a
// `file:line:col`, and a caret span. Nothing in them is JavaScript-shaped, so a Go implementation
// can be scored against them without emitting a byte of JavaScript.
//
// That is the entire premise. The corpus is the asset; this runner is the cheap part.
//
// # What this deliberately is not
//
// It does not plug into upstream's Jest harness, and the reason is mechanical rather than a
// preference. `compiler/scripts/test-e2e.ts` declares `type Variant = 'babel'` with
// `ALL_VARIANTS = ['babel']`. There is no backend-registration mechanism to register into and no
// `--variant` value that would reach a Go implementation. Building against that surface would mean
// maintaining a Node shim to satisfy a Babel `PluginObj` contract in order to reach a corpus that
// is already readable as text.
//
// The contract shape instead comes from upstream's own
// `eslint-plugin-react-compiler/__tests__/RustBackendComparison-test.ts`, which compares two
// backends by asserting equal `{message, line}` pairs. That is backend-agnostic by construction: no
// AST, no transform, no Rust. This runner uses the same pair and takes the corpus from the 325
// goldens rather than that test's ~21 inline cases.
//
// # Reporting zero honestly
//
// Nothing implements these rules yet, so the first honest score is 0 of 325. The failure this
// package is built against is not a low score, it is a low score that cannot be told apart from an
// empty one: a runner that finds no fixtures, or refuses them all, also reports zero, and reads
// identically in a terminal. So `Score` carries `Considered`, `Excluded`, and `Refused` alongside
// `Passed`, no path can decrement `Considered` without incrementing exactly one of the outcome
// counters, and `TestRunnerCanDetectAPass` scores a hand-written correct result to prove the
// comparison can return true at all.
//
// # Why this suite is not gated
//
// The brief allowed a build tag or `testing.Short()` if the suite turned out slow or
// network-dependent. It is neither, and both properties come from the same decision: the corpus is
// vendored, so there is no fetch, and the work is reading 650 small files and splitting strings.
// Measured at about 0.3-0.8s for the whole package, which is inside the noise of the ordinary gate.
// Gating it would cost more than it saves — a suite behind a tag is a suite that stops being run,
// and the first thing it would stop catching is a vendored corpus that quietly changed size.
//
// `tools/vendor_react_fixtures` is the network-touching half, and it is a command run deliberately
// when the pin moves, never from a test.
