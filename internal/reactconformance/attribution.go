// This file answers a question the goldens do not answer for themselves: which upstream rule owns
// each expected diagnostic.
//
// # Why an attribution layer has to exist at all
//
// The `## Error` block prints a heading and a message. It does not print the `ErrorCategory` that
// produced them, and the category is the only thing that names a rule. So the obvious join — match
// a fixture to a rule by its filename — is not available, and the two plausible substitutes are
// both wrong in ways that read as clean results.
//
// Matching on the `error.` filename is wrong because the prefix names the *fixture author's*
// intent, not the validator that ran. Measured at the pinned sha: all three fixtures whose names
// say error-boundaries (`error.todo-invalid-jsx-in-try-with-finally` and its two neighbours) expect
// a `Todo` from `BuildHIR::lowerStatement` instead, because React's lowering aborts on a `try` with
// no `catch` before the ErrorBoundaries validator is ever reached. A filename join scores
// error-boundaries against three fixtures that cannot exercise it.
//
// Guessing from the message text is wrong because messages are shared across categories and are
// assembled by interpolation. `Found missing/extra memoization dependencies` is built at
// `ValidateExhaustiveDependencies.ts:1078` by joining two words into a template, so it appears in
// no source file as a literal string and a grep for it returns nothing.
//
// # Where this map comes from
//
// Upstream's own emission sites, read at the pinned sha. Every diagnostic is constructed with an
// explicit `category: ErrorCategory.X`, or through one of four `CompilerError` helpers that hardcode
// one (`invariant` → Invariant, `throwTodo` → Todo, `throwInvalidJS` → Syntax, `throwInvalidConfig`
// → Config). The category is then mapped to a rule name by `getRuleForCategory`, whose switch is
// closed by `assertExhaustive`, so the rule list cannot drift without upstream failing to compile.
//
// # How this map was checked, rather than trusted
//
// Two independent cross-checks, both of which had to hold before the numbers below were written.
//
// First, coverage: the map attributes all 429 diagnostics with none left over. An earlier revision
// left 110 unattributed and then 79 and then 53, each time because a message was built by
// interpolation or reached through a `const` indirection. A map that covered 376 of 429 would have
// produced a per-rule table that looked entirely reasonable, which is why the residual is asserted
// at zero rather than eyeballed.
//
// Second, and this is the load-bearing one: the heading. Upstream's printer assigns exactly one of
// four headings per category (`CompilerError.ts:565`). Running every attributed category through
// that switch reproduces the heading the golden actually printed, for all 429, with zero
// mismatches. That check was not used to build the map, so it is genuine evidence: a
// misattribution between two categories with different headings could not survive it.
//
// It cannot catch a swap between two categories that share a heading (Globals and Refs both print
// `Error`), so it is a necessary rather than sufficient check, and that limit is stated here rather
// than left for a reader to discover.

// CategoryForMessage returns the upstream ErrorCategory that produces a diagnostic message.
//
// Keyed on the message's first line, which is what the golden prints after the heading and what
// upstream's own backend comparison asserts on.
func CategoryForMessage(message string) (string, bool) {
	if category, found := categoryByMessage[message]; found {
		return category, true
	}

	}
	return "", false
}

	Prefix   string
	Category string
}

// categoryByMessagePrefix covers the diagnostics upstream assembles from a template.
//
// These cannot be exact-matched because the variable part is a node type, a binding name, or a
// joined word. The prefix is the invariant half, taken from the template in upstream's source
// rather than from the corpus, so a fixture using a spelling the corpus does not currently contain
