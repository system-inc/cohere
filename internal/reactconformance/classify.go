// ShippedRules are the upstream rule names verify has an implementation for, mapped to the name
// verify registers that rule under.
//
// Keyed by UPSTREAM's rule name rather than verify's, because the join to the corpus goes through
// upstream's `getRuleForCategory`.
//
// # The value side was wrong for every entry, and nothing could see it
//
// Until 2026-08-24 every value here read `react/<name>`, on the strength of a doc comment claiming
// the two sides "happen to agree on spelling" and that the map was explicit so a rename would be "a
// visible edit rather than a silent unjoin". Measured against `registry.All()`: not one of those
// eleven strings is a registered rule. The react-compiler rules register BARE — `globals`,
// `rules-of-hooks`, `use-memo` — and the namespace was never part of the name.
//
// The unjoin was silent for the reason the comment did not anticipate: nothing in this package ever
// READ the value. `Classify` asks only `_, found := ShippedRules[ruleName]`, so the right-hand side
// was decorative, and a decorative field that claims to be a join is worse than no field, because
// it reads as checked. `TestShippedRuleNamesAreRegistered` now reads it, which is what makes this
// map's second column a claim rather than a caption. That is the open finding `#5vyycz7` measured:
// the parity guard cannot see a namespaced spelling because this side was never executed.
//
// `hooks` maps to verify's `rules-of-hooks`, which is the one place the two names differ.

// TypeAwareRules are the shipped rules whose DECISION depends on resolving React's own types.
//
// This list is what makes `VerdictUnresolvableTypes` a measurement rather than an excuse: only a
// rule that actually reads types can be excused by a fixture that has none. A syntax-only rule
// producing nothing on an import-less fixture is a failure, and must be scored as one. Getting this
// wrong in the generous direction inflates the score with excuses, so the bar for entry is narrow
// and stated below.
//
// # `NeedsTypeChecker` is the wrong test, and it was the obvious one
//
// Nine of the fifteen react-compiler rules declare `NeedsTypeChecker`. Reading membership off that
// flag would put `globals`, `use-memo`, `purity` and `unsupported-syntax` in here and hand each of
// them a blanket excuse on every import-less fixture. Measured at the call sites, the flag covers
// two different questions:
//
//	GetSymbolAtLocation      binding resolution: "is this identifier declared anywhere in scope?"
//	                         Answers correctly with no `@types/react` present, because the question
//	                         is about the fixture's own bindings. `globals.go:616`, `use_memo.go:424`,
//	                         `purity.go:565`, `unsupported_syntax.go:234`. NOT an excuse.
//	GetTypeAtLocation        reads a type and then its alias symbol, which is `any` without React's
//	                         declarations, so the deciding branch cannot be reached.
//	                         `set_state_in_render.go:450`, `refs.go:359`. This IS the excuse.
//
// So membership is by call site, verified rather than declared. `set-state-in-effect` is kept from
// the previous revision on the same grounds (it ships fixtures carrying a local `react.d.ts` at
// `set_state_in_effect_test.go:57` for exactly this reason), and `refs` joins it on the measurement
// above.
//
// `static-components` was in this map and is REMOVED. It declares `NeedsTypeChecker: true` at
// `static_components.go:100` and then never touches `ctx.TypeChecker` anywhere in its body —
// grepped for the selector, zero hits. It was in here on the strength of a declaration it does not
// use, which is the generous direction this comment warns about, arriving through the flag rather

// The stated boundaries verify's react rules carry were all measured against oxc's inline corpus or
// against the executable ESLint rule, and every one of them was checked against this corpus while
// building this file. None of them lands on a fixture in the 325:
//
//   - exhaustive-deps at 15 of 17 kinds (`TestExhaustiveDepsScopeIsStated`, eight named cases): its
//     rule is `exhaustive-deps`, an ESLint rule. The corpus's nearest categories are
//     `memo-dependencies` (14 fixtures) and `exhaustive-effect-dependencies` (4), which are the
//     COMPILER's dependency validators and a different mechanism. Neither is a rule verify ships.
//   - set-state-in-effect's ref exemption, pinned as a fixture that fails when fixed: that rule has
//     zero error-named fixtures in this corpus, so the divergence cannot be exercised here.
//   - no-unused-vars at 301 of 303: not a react rule and not in this corpus at all.
//
// The eleven entries below are `globals` fixtures, and they are here because the rule was actually
// RUN against them (`internal/reactconformancescore`) rather than because a doc comment predicted
// them. Every one declines on a construct its doc comment already names as out of scope: eight on
// the nested-function subset that needs an inter-procedural effects pass, three on the compilation
// gate that requires JSX or a hook call in the body.
//
// This is the category the brief was most worried about, and the measurement justifies the worry
// exactly: a raw score would have reported `react/globals` at 0 of 11 and read as a broken rule. It
// is a rule with a written, machine-checked boundary meeting a corpus of minimal repros that sit
// entirely outside it.
//
// What that means for the number is worth stating plainly rather than leaving implicit: 0 passed
// and 11 excluded is NOT the same claim as 11 passed. The rule is unmeasured against this corpus,
// not validated by it. The honest reading is that React's error goldens for `globals` and verify's
// `globals` do not overlap, and closing that gap is a scope decision rather than a bug fix.

	// statable rule: `const f = () => {g=1}; f()` reports upstream, `const f = () => {g=1};
	// return <Foo cb={f}/>` does not, and `return <Foo>{f}</Foo>` does again. `TestGlobalsBoundary`
