//
// # Why the walk stops where it does
//
// The set of kinds is the set of things that can THEMSELVES be dead. A reference inside an `if`
// block belongs to the function containing the block, because deleting the function deletes the
// reference; the block is not a unit anyone deletes on its own. Function, class, interface, type,
// enum, variable, method, accessor, constructor, property, module and export-assignment are the
// units, and everything else is passed through.
//
// # What was probed rather than assumed
//
// The three shapes where "what declaration am I inside" gets strange were measured on a fixture
// built for exactly this, not reasoned about:
//
//	JSX          `<div title={String(usedInJsx())}>` attributes both `String` and `usedInJsx` to the
//	             enclosing function. A JSX expression container does not break the parent chain.
//	decorators   `@usedByDecorator() export class DecoratedClass {}` attributes the decorator's
//	             reference to `DecoratedClass`, because the decorator is a child of the class node.
//	             That is the answer this analysis wants: if the class is dead its decorator's
//	             reference should die with it, rather than escaping to module level as a root.
//	default      `export default function defaultFn()` attributes to `defaultFn`. The anonymous
//	exports      `export default arrow` form lands on the ExportAssignment, which has no name — see
//	             `symbolOfDeclaration` for why that case still resolves.
//
// Returning nil at `KindSourceFile` rather than falling out of the loop is deliberate: a module-top
// -level reference must be distinguishable from a walk that ran off the end of a detached subtree,
// and both would otherwise produce the same nil.

// ExportAssignment with no name for `GetSymbolAtLocation` to be given, so the checker path returns

// FindUnreferenced builds a program-wide reverse index and reports the exported declarations

//
// # Why a program-wide index rather than per-rule symbol comparison
//
// `internal/rule/rule.go` argues at length against putting a references-to-a-binding helper on the
// shelf, and that argument is correct for every rule shipped so far. It does not govern this,
// and the comment says so itself in its own last paragraph: "Find-all-references answers 'where is
// this used', and these rules already know where to look, since they walk one file. They need 'is
// this the same binding', which is a symbol comparison. Reaching for a reverse index here would be
// answering a forward question with the wrong instrument."
//
// This is the forward question. "Where is this used" is the entire output, the scope is the program
// rather than one file, and there is no cheaper tier that is correct: name matching cannot tell an
// unused `Button` from a used one in another file, and per-file symbol comparison cannot answer a
// whole-program question at all. The cost the rule comment refuses to hide behind an import is
// stated here instead — this is a phase, run when asked for, not a rule that every file pays for.
//
// # What the index is keyed on
//
// Symbol pointers, established by probe on this substrate before anything was built on it: 42 of 42
// imported names resolved through `GetAliasedSymbol` to a declaration in another file, with zero nil
// symbols. Pointer identity is what makes a reference in one file and a declaration in another the
