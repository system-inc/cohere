// TestAliasAccessorsWalkTheChainToADeprecation guards the two alias accessors this shim exposes.
//
// `Checker_getImmediateAliasedSymbol` and `Checker_resolveAlias` were added so a rule can answer one
// question: is the thing this identifier names deprecated, when the deprecation may sit on an alias
// rather than on the declaration the name resolves to. Importing a symbol gives you an alias of the
// exported one, which is itself an alias of the original, and a `@deprecated` tag can be written on
// any link in that chain.
//
// Before these accessors existed the chain was unreachable and the answer was silently WRONG rather
// than absent. Measured on the seeded case below: reading the resolved symbol's own declarations
// answers "not deprecated" for an export whose alias carries the tag. That is a false negative,
// which costs findings and announces nothing.
//
// # What each assertion has to survive
//
// The precedent in this package sets the standard and it applies here: assert what the value IS,
// never that it is present. A nil check on `resolveAlias` passes for a chain that resolves to the
// wrong symbol entirely, and "the walk found a deprecation" passes for a walk that reports one on
// every input. So each case below names the symbol the chain must reach, and the negative case is
// carried alongside the two positives rather than assumed.
//
// The three cases are chosen to fail differently:
//
//	deprecation on the exported ALIAS      only the walk can find it; the resolved symbol says no
//	deprecation on the ORIGINAL            both the walk and the resolved symbol find it
//	deprecation NOWHERE                    both must say no, or the two above prove nothing
//
// Without the third, a walk that answered "deprecated" unconditionally would pass the first two.
//
// # BOTH accessors panic on a non-alias, and the caller-side gate is mandatory
//
// Each one opens by testing `SymbolFlagsAlias` and panicking when it is unset. That reads like a
// guard and is an assertion: `if symbol.Flags&ast.SymbolFlagsAlias == 0 { panic(...) }` at
// checker.go:2162 and 16361. A rule's walk recovers per FILE rather than per rule, so one unguarded
// call costs every rule that file, which is how this project lost 167 files once already.
//
// This is written down because the first version of this test asserted the opposite. It expected
// `resolveAlias` to return a non-alias unchanged, on a reading of that same line as a guard, and the
// test panicked rather than failing, which is the whole argument for asserting instead of printing.
// A probe that printed its result would have shown the panic as a crash with no verdict attached,
// and the wrong belief would have reached the rule.
