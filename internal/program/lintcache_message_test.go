// A cached finding has to be printable, and today it is not.
//
// LintCacheFinding stores MessageId and not the description. That is only safe if an id determines
// its text, because printRuleDiagnostic (cmd/verify/main.go) prints Message.Description directly and
// nothing in the tree derives text from an id. Where an id does not determine its text, replaying a
// cached finding prints an empty or wrong message beside a correct file, range and rule — a cache
// serving a confidently wrong answer, which is the one failure mode here that looks like success.
//
// This test measures the property rather than asserting the conclusion, so it keeps being useful
// after the format is fixed: it reports which ids are ambiguous and why. Whichever fix lands
// (storing text, or refusing the dynamic ids), the numbers here are what that fix has to cover.
//
// The check is textual, like the ReadsProgram guard, and for the same reason: it covers every rule
// in the tree rather than only the ones a program happened to exercise.
