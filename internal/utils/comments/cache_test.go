// `ForFile` had no direct test until now.
//
// It was exercised through the three rules that call it, which proves those three get comments and
// says nothing about the property the function exists for. A rule reaching for it next would be
// trusting a measurement nobody can re-run, which is the state `@system_verify_lint_rules_tailwind`
// named `unverified`: committed, green, reachable, and unproven.
//
// The property is not "returns comments". `All` already does that and is tested. The property is
// **computed once per file and shared**, and the whole reason the function exists is a measurement:
// three rules each visiting one node per file cost 807ms, 619ms and 601ms because each rescanned
// the file independently.

// A counting cache stands in for the real one so the test can observe how many times the work ran.
// The production path uses `rule.Cached` against a live `FileCache`; what is asserted here is the
// contract both sides rely on, which is that a second ask does not recompute.
