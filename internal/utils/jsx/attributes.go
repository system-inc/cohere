// Package jsx answers the questions a rule asks about a JSX element: what tag it names, what
// attributes it writes, and what a given attribute's text is.
//
// Lifted out of `internal/rules/next/` on 2026-08-23, where it had been shared across five
// `@next/next` rules and was invisible to every other namespace. The eighteen ordinary
// `eslint-plugin-react` rules ask the same questions, and left where it was, `react` would have
// re-decided attribute matching and the two would have drifted permanently. That drift is the
// thing this shelf exists to prevent.
//
// It lives under `internal/utils/` because `TestRulePackagesStayLeaves` refuses an import that
// pushes a rule package off the leaf of the graph, and that prefix is on the allowlist: this
// package moves when JSX handling changes, not when a rule is written.

// rule uses is part of what that rule decides rather than a detail of how it looks things up.
//
// `no-css-tags`, `no-sync-scripts` and `no-img-element` compare exactly. `google-font-preconnect`
// and `google-font-display` go through oxc's `has_jsx_prop_ignore_case`. Both spellings are
// preserved per rule rather than unified, because unifying would mean choosing for upstream: made
// case-insensitive everywhere, a rule would start reporting `<link REL="stylesheet">` that its
// original ignores; made exact everywhere, one would stop reporting what its original catches.
//
// JSX itself is case-sensitive, so the insensitive matchers describe upstream's leniency rather
// than anything the language requires.

//     `JSXAttributeName::Identifier` everywhere and declines anything else
//   - a nil name, which the parser can produce on malformed input
//

// loops below, and `@system_verify_format` found a third rule about to hand-roll it: a rule that
// reports *on the attribute* rather than on the element needs the node, and neither element-level
