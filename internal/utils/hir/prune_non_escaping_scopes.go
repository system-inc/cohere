// Pruning scopes whose values never escape, which is the reason the memoization lattice exists.
//
// This is React's `pruneNonEscapingScopes` (`ReactiveScopes/PruneNonEscapingScopes.ts` at
// `reactconformance.UpstreamSha`), assembled from the pieces this package already carries: the
// lattice in `memoization_level.go`, the per-kind classification in `memoization_inputs.go`, and the
// graph and propagation in `memoization_graph.go`.
//
// # What it does, in four phases
//
//  1. Walk the tree once, building a node per declaration: its memoization level, the operands it
//     depends on, and the scopes it belongs to. The same walk collects the escaping roots.
//  2. Roots are values that are returned, or passed as an argument to a hook. A returned value
//     escapes because the caller holds it; a hook argument escapes because React may retain it,
//     which is why the closure handed to `useEffect` is memoized.
//  3. Propagate outward from the roots. See `ComputeMemoized`.
//  4. Replace any scope with no memoized output by its own instructions, dropping the wrapper.
//
// # Why a scope with no memoized output is worth dropping
//
// Memoizing a value nothing holds costs a comparison every render and buys nothing. Upstream's
// worked example is a component building three arrays where only one is returned: without this pass
// all three are memoized, and two of those memoizations can never pay for themselves.
