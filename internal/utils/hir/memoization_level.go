// How strongly a value needs memoizing, which is the lattice `pruneNonEscapingScopes` walks.
//
// This is React's `MemoizationLevel` and `joinAliases`
// (`ReactiveScopes/PruneNonEscapingScopes.ts` at `reactconformance.UpstreamSha`).
//
// # Four levels rather than a boolean, and the difference is not cosmetic
//
// The obvious model is "does this value escape". That model passes every fixture where a returned
// value must be memoized and is wrong on every fixture where memoization propagates: a value that
// does not escape may still need memoizing because something that does escape depends on it, and a
// value that escapes may still be free to recompute because it is cheaply comparable.
//
// The four levels separate those questions. `Memoized` needs memoizing if it escapes at all;
// `Conditional` needs it only when something it feeds does; `Unmemoized` is not comparable with
// `Object.is` but is left alone unless forced; `Never` is cheap to compare and is never worth
// memoizing.

// MemoizationLevel is how a value's memoization is decided relative to its dependencies.
//
// The constant order is the join order and is load-bearing: `JoinMemoizationLevels` takes the
// maximum, so a value appearing as an lvalue at two levels gets the stronger one. Reordering these
// silently changes every classification.

// final level is the strongest any of those assignments demanded.
//
// A max over the constant order rather than a chain, because the two are the same function and the
// max says why: the levels are ordered by strength and the join is "whichever demanded more".
