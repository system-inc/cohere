// Making a method call and its property agree about scopes.
//
// This is React's `alignMethodCallScopes` (`ReactiveScopes/AlignMethodCallScopes.ts`), the first of
// three passes upstream runs immediately before `alignReactiveScopesToBlockScopes`
// (`Entrypoint/Pipeline.ts:350-384`).
//
// # What it guarantees
//
// After this pass, a `MethodCall` instruction satisfies one of two states: the call's lvalue and the
// property it reads share a scope, or neither has one. The in-between state -- one scoped, one not,
// or two different scopes -- is what it removes.
//
// # Why the in-between state is a problem rather than an imprecision
//
// `a.b()` lowers to a `PropertyLoad` producing the method and a `MethodCall` consuming it. The two
// are one expression in source and the scope machinery treats them as separate values, so they can
// land in different equivalence classes. A scope containing the call but not the property is a scope
// whose range starts after a value it depends on was computed, which is exactly the shape
// `AlignReactiveScopesToBlockScopes` then widens across a block boundary.
//
// Measured on `drawHighlightedCountryOutlines`, the one corpus function whose alignment residue is
// non-zero once declaration ids stop colliding: it is a `for...of` over a `Map` with a
// `console.log`, method calls throughout.

// takes a `ReactiveScopes` and hands back widened ranges rather than writing through.
//
// # Two mechanisms, and they are not interchangeable
//
// When both sides carry a scope, the two scopes MERGE: the survivor's range grows to cover both.
// When only one side carries one, the other side's scope ASSIGNMENT changes -- the property joins
// the call's scope, or loses its own. Upstream keeps these apart with a disjoint set for the first
// and a mapping for the second, and the distinction matters because a merge changes a range while a
