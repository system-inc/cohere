// Classifying every instruction value by how strongly it needs memoizing.
//
// This is the level half of React's `computeMemoizationInputs`
// (`ReactiveScopes/PruneNonEscapingScopes.ts` at `reactconformance.UpstreamSha`). The rvalue half --
// which operands a value carries -- is `EachPlace`, which this package already has.
//
// # It is a transcription, which took measuring to establish
//
// This was scoped as the largest judgment call in the pipeline on the belief that our 67 instruction
// values had to be mapped onto upstream's smaller set. That 67 was a miscount: it came from the
// `EachPlace` switch, which covers instruction values, terminals and patterns together.
//
// The real numbers are 43 instruction values here against 47 upstream arms, and the difference is
// exactly the four composite values this tree models as `ReactiveValue` variants -- ternary,
// logical, sequence, optional -- plus one spelling difference, `JSXText` against `JsxText`.
// Normalised and diffed both ways: 47 and 47, nothing uncovered in either direction.
//
// So every arm below has one upstream counterpart and the classification is transcribed rather than
// argued.
//
// # The three option-dependent arms, which are where the judgment actually was
//
// Upstream computes two options from environment flags:
//
//	memoizeJsxElements     = !enableForest
//	forceMemoizePrimitives =  enableForest || enablePreserveExistingMemoizationGuarantees
//
// Schema defaults at `HIR/Environment.ts:205,240` are `enableForest: false` and
// `enablePreserveExistingMemoizationGuarantees: true`, so both options are true, which decides:
//
//	JsxExpression, JsxFragment  ->  Memoized     (Unmemoized under Forest)
//	the 13-kind primitive group ->  Conditional  (Never without the force)
//
// A mechanical extraction read the primitive group as `Conditional` by taking the first level in the
// arm. That is the forced branch; the default branch is `Never`. The extraction was right by
// accident, and anyone re-deriving this must resolve the flags rather than read the first branch.

	// that should not escape, which keeps a scope upstream prunes, which the rule then validates a
	// memoization against. A default safe under one consumer is a defect under another.
	//
