// Pattern is a destructuring target.
//
// Kept structured rather than expanded into loads and stores at lowering time. The reason is that
// the shape is observable and several consumers want it: `const {a, b} = props` is the canonical
// dependency shape React's memoization rules reason about, and recovering "these two bindings came
// from one destructure of one object" from a flattened sequence of property loads means
// re-inferring what the syntax already said.
//
// The flattening is available to any pass that wants it - walk the pattern and emit loads - and is
// not available in reverse. So the structured form is what lowering produces.
