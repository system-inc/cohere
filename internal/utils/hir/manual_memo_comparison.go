// Comparing the dependencies a developer wrote against the ones the compiler inferred.
//
// This is React's `compareDeps` and its `CompareDependencyResult`
// (`Validation/ValidatePreservedManualMemoization.ts` at `reactconformance.UpstreamSha`), the third
// firing condition of `preserve-manual-memoization` and the one that owns eleven of the thirteen
// goldens the two scope conditions leave silent.
//
// # What it decides
//
// A developer wrote `useMemo(fn, [props.a.b])`. The compiler infers what the callback actually
// reads. If the inferred dependency is `props.a` where the source said `props.a.b`, the value now
// recomputes whenever anything under `props.a` changes -- more often than the developer asked for.
// The reverse is equally wrong in the other direction.
//
// # The asymmetry, which is upstream's and is easy to get backwards
//
// An inferred path longer than the source path is fine: reading `props.a.b` when the source declared
// `props.a` recomputes no more often than promised, because any change to `props.a.b` is a change to
// `props.a`. An inferred path shorter than the source path is not fine, for the mirror reason.
//
// So the test is not equality. It is "the inferred path is at least as precise as the source path",
// with one exception below.
//
// # Refs are the exception, and the reason is one line of algebra
//
// A ref is not an immutable value: `ref_prev === ref_new` does not imply
// `ref_prev.current === ref_new.current`. So a partial match through a `current` access proves
// nothing, and the longer-is-fine rule is withdrawn wherever either path reads `current`.
