// Dropping manual memoization: recognising `useMemo`/`useCallback` and recording what the developer
// WROTE before the compiler is allowed to infer anything.
//
// This is React's `dropManualMemoization` (`Inference/DropManualMemoization.ts` at
// `reactconformance.UpstreamSha`) run over this graph. oxc transcribes it at
// `react_compiler_optimization/drop_manual_memoization.rs`; where the two disagree React wins, and
// each disagreement is recorded at the line that resolves it.
//
// # This pass exists because one rule needs an input nothing else produces
//
// `react/preserve-manual-memoization` reports when a developer's hand-written dependency array
// disagrees with the dependencies the compiler infers. The inferred half is `dependencies.go`. This
// file is the DECLARED half, and before it existed `StartMemoize` and `FinishMemoize` were declared
// instruction values that nothing in this tree constructed -- measured at 0 markers across 66,357
// instructions in 677 functions while the same sweep found 455 `ArrayExpression`s, so the probe was
// reading instructions correctly and the zero was the lowering rather than the corpus.
//
// That is why the pass produces MARKERS rather than a diagnostic. The comparison happens later,
// against a value this file must not compute: if this pass inferred the dependencies itself, both
// sides of the rule's comparison would come from the same code and could never disagree.
//
// # What it does to the callback, which is the surprising half
//
// The name says "drop", and the memoization really is dropped: the call to `useMemo` is REWRITTEN
// to call the callback directly, and `useCallback` is rewritten to a plain alias of it.
//
//	before:  $1 = LoadGlobal useMemo      after:  $1 = LoadGlobal useMemo   (now dead)
//	         $2 = Function fn0                    $2 = Function fn0
//	         $3 = Array [$5]                      $3 = Array [$5]           (now dead)
//	         $4 = Call $1($2, $3)                 $4 = Call $2()
//
// For `useCallback` the last line becomes `$4 = LoadLocal $2` instead, because a callback is not
// invoked where it is created. Upstream's comments at `getManualMemoizationReplacement` spell both
// rewrites out and this reproduces them exactly.
//
// The interaction with everything built around it is therefore REAL rather than inert, and it runs
// in the safe direction. No instruction is deleted, no block is created or removed, and no terminal
// is touched, so the control-flow graph is bit-identical afterwards and every analysis keyed on
// block structure -- scope terminals, postdominators, reverse postorder -- sees exactly what it saw
// before. What changes is one instruction VALUE per memo call, and it changes toward less
// structure: a two-argument call becomes a zero-argument call or a load. Operand counts fall, which
// means inferred mutable ranges and scope dependencies can only shrink or stay equal, never grow.
// This was measured rather than argued; see `TestDropManualMemoizationDifferential`.
//
// The dead `LoadGlobal` and `ArrayExpression` are deliberately LEFT behind, matching upstream, which
// relies on later dead-code elimination. Removing them here would renumber instructions under the
// markers this same pass just inserted.
//
// # Where it runs, and the precondition that decides the whole design
//
// Upstream calls this at `Pipeline.ts:169`, and what sits below that line is the specification:
// `enterSSA` is at line 189, twenty lines LATER. This pass runs BEFORE single-assignment form.
// Upstream's own header says so and gives the reason -- it must compose with
// `InlineImmediatelyInvokedFunctionExpressions`, which runs immediately after it and would
// otherwise invalidate the form.
//
// The consequence is not stylistic. Pre-SSA, a `useMemo` global cannot be found by type inference,
// because `inferTypes` is at line 200. So upstream tracks globals and property loads by hand
// through a sidemap, and this file does the same rather than reaching for a type. That is why
// `Recognise` is syntactic: it is not a shortcut, it is the only information available at this
// point in the pipeline.
//
// `DropManualMemoization` therefore takes a function fresh from `Lower` and must be called BEFORE
// `Construct`. That ordering is asserted rather than documented, because `Construct` is not
// idempotent and a caller who ran it first would get markers whose operands name pre-renaming
// identifiers -- an error that produces plausible output. See `dropAfterConstructIsRefused`.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: optionality is READ here, not reconstructed
//
// React spends the last fifty lines of its file on `findOptionalPlaces`, which walks `optional`
// terminals and their branch arms to recover which places came from `?.`. It needs that because its
// `PropertyLoad` does not carry the flag.
//
// Ours does: `PropertyLoad.Optional` is set at lowering (`lower_expression.go:190`), so
// `props.a?.b` arrives already marked and the reconstruction is unnecessary. Transcribing
// `findOptionalPlaces` here would have been worse than redundant -- it would have been silently
// EMPTY, because it keys on the `Optional` TERMINAL, which `lower.go:78` records as declared and
// never constructed in this tree. A faithful transcription would have returned an empty set at
// every call site, marked every `?.` dependency as non-optional, and passed every test written from
// unguarded fixtures.
//
// That is the exact failure the rule exists to catch, in the pass that feeds it: `props.a` and
// `props?.a` differ by one character at path depth one, and upstream's `areEqualPaths` compares the
// flag. `TestDropManualMemoizationOptionalPathsSurvive` pins it.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: `React.useMemo` arrives as a MethodCall with a Primitive property
//
// Upstream recognises the namespaced form by seeing `PropertyLoad` off a `LoadGlobal React`, then
// matching a `CallExpression` whose callee is that load. Our lowering emits a single `MethodCall`
// whose `Property` is a `Primitive` holding the string, so the upstream shape never appears and a
// direct transcription would have missed every `React.useMemo` call while handling bare `useMemo`
// correctly -- a partial recognition that looks like a working pass. Both spellings are handled
// here and `TestDropManualMemoizationRecognisesBothSpellings` holds them together.
//
// # The distribution that proves these markers are real
//
// A count of markers cannot separate a working pass from one that emits a marker at every call, so
// the headline is a CROSS-TABULATION of call sites recognised against markers emitted and
// dependencies extracted, over the corpus. The control cell is calls that are NOT memo calls: a
// pass that emitted markers indiscriminately would empty it. See
// `TestDropManualMemoizationDistributionIsReal`.
