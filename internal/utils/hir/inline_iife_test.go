// Every assertion here is written against a graph PROPERTY rather than against a printed shape,

// block still prints instructions in a plausible order. The properties asserted are the four the
// splice can violate independently -- the call is gone, no return of the copied body remains, every
// exit of the copied body reaches the continuation, and the call's result is defined on every path
// out of it.
