// Lowering: TypeScript AST to HIR.
//
// This is a proving implementation, not a complete one. It covers the statement and expression
// forms the design had to be tested against - blocks, conditionals, all four loop forms, switch,
// try/catch/finally, labeled break and continue, destructuring, calls, member access, logical and
// conditional operators, template literals, and JSX - and lowers everything else to
// `UnsupportedNode`, which is a value with unknown effects rather than a failure.
//
// Upstream's equivalent is `build_hir.rs` at 6,807 lines and it is the largest single chunk of work
// in any port of this compiler. Completing it is a later task; what is established here is that the
// data structures in this package can hold the result, which is the question that had to be
// answered before anything is built on top.
//
// # The builder, and why blocks are reserved before they are filled
//
// A terminal names its successors by id, and lowering discovers a construct's successors before it
// has lowered them: an `if` needs the ids of its consequent, alternate, and fallthrough at the
// moment it writes the terminal, and only one of those has been walked. So blocks are RESERVED -
// allocated with an id and no contents - then filled, then completed with a terminal. The pattern
// is upstream's and it is the reason the builder is a small state machine rather than a
// straightforward recursive descent.
//
// `currentBlock` is where instructions are appended right now. `terminate` closes it with a
// terminal and makes a named reserved block current.
//
// # Where lowering gives up, stated exhaustively
//
// This list is load-bearing rather than incidental. A lowering that abandons a function changes
// what every fixture below it is evidence about: a rule can only fire on code that reached it, so
// an abort condition silently redefines the corpus. Upstream's lowering aborts on `try`/`finally`
// with no `catch`, and a sibling porting `react/error-boundaries` lost real time to that, because
// the fixtures named for the rule never reached the validator at all and the fixture NAME gave no
// sign of it.
//
// So, completely, the places this lowering does not produce a faithful result:
//
//  1. `Lower` returns NIL for a node with no body - an overload signature, an ambient declaration,
//     an abstract method. Nothing was lost, because nothing runs. Callers must handle nil.
//
//  2. Everything else produces a function. There is NO condition under which lowering abandons a
//     function it started, and that is a deliberate divergence from upstream, which aborts on
//     several constructs. An unmodelled construct becomes `UnsupportedNode`: a value with unknown
//     effects, which is conservative rather than absent. A pass that must refuse such a function
//     checks for the variant and refuses explicitly, where the refusal is visible.
//
//  3. Constructs that currently reach `UnsupportedNode` rather than a faithful lowering, so a pass
//     reading them gets "something happened here" and no more:
//     class declarations and class expressions; `with`; `yield` and `yield*`; `import()`;
//     `new.target`; getters and setters as object members lower their body but the accessor
//     semantics are not modelled; decorators; and any statement or expression kind not named in the
//     switches in this file and lower_expression.go.
//
//  4. Known imprecision that is NOT an abort, listed because it will mislead a pass that assumes
//     otherwise:
//     - `var` is lowered as `let`. Function-scoped hoisting is not modelled, so a `var` used before
//     its declaration in a different block resolves as though it were block-scoped.
//     - A free identifier becomes `LoadGlobal` whether it is a true global, an import, or a
//     module-scope binding. `GlobalBindingKind` is always `Global`. Distinguishing an import from
//     a true global belongs to a later pass. A CAPTURE is no longer in this list: see `captureOf`.
//     Note what this entry originally claimed and what was measured. It said resolution "needs the
//     checker", which was right, but `Lower` took no checker and `symbolOf` read `node.Symbol()` -
//     a field the binder writes only onto DECLARATION nodes, and only when a binder has run at
//     all. Parsing alone runs none. So the fallback caught not just free identifiers but EVERY
//     identifier: over 4,333 functions of real TypeScript, 0 `LoadLocal` instructions named a
//     source variable against 43,137 `LoadGlobal`. `Lower` now takes a checker, and this entry is
//     true again only for names that checker cannot resolve.
//     - `MaybeThrow` is not emitted. The `Try` terminal gives the handler an edge, but the
//     instruction-level "an exception can leave here" markers upstream places after each
//     throwable instruction in a try body are absent, so an effect pass cannot yet see the
//     partial state a mid-body throw leaves behind.
//     - Hoisting of `let`/`const` forward references, which upstream models with `DeclareContext`
//     for temporal-dead-zone correctness, is not modelled.
//
//  5. Instruction values and terminals that are DECLARED but that lowering never produces. They are
//     in the sets because a later pass needs them, and because adding a variant later invalidates
//     every existing exhaustive switch, so the shape is fixed now. A pass must not read the absence
//     of one as evidence about the source:
//     `Optional` (terminal) - an optional chain currently lowers to a `PropertyLoad` or
//     `ComputedLoad` with the `Optional` flag set, which records the optionality but NOT the
//     short-circuit control flow, so a pass asking "does this run on every path" gets the wrong
//     answer for `a?.b.c`; this is the likeliest of these to mislead.
//     `Sequence` (terminal) - a comma expression lowers both operands into one block, which is
//     correct for evaluation order and loses the construct.
//     `MaybeThrow` (terminal) - see above.
//     `DeclareContext` - hoisting of a binding a nested function captures is not modelled, so the
//     temporal dead zone is not visible. `LoadContext` and `StoreContext` ARE produced, for every
//     read and write of a binding an enclosing function declared.
//     `StartMemoize`, `FinishMemoize` - inserted by a later pass by design, never by lowering.

// phi where the source has no join.

// What this costs: with one layout, the value flowing out of a finally is a merge of the normal and
// abrupt paths, so a `return` inside a `try` and the fallthrough both reach the same block. A pass
// that must distinguish them needs the predecessor, which is exactly what Predecessors provides.
// This is the trade: the information is preserved as graph structure rather than as duplication.
//
// # try with no catch
//
// A bare `try...finally` still gets a handler edge, to a synthetic block that runs the finally and
// rethrows. That differs from `controlflow`, which gives a body that cannot throw no edge to its
// catch at all. The reason is that "cannot throw" is a judgement a later, more precise pass may
