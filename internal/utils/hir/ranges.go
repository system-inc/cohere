// Mutable ranges: over which span of a function's evaluation a value is still being written.
//
// This is React's `InferMutationAliasingRanges.ts`, run over this graph to produce a
// `MutableRanges` table. Stage 2 built the half that reads no effects; Stage 2.5 added the half that
// does, which is the `AliasingState` graph and its `mutate` worklist at the bottom of this file. oxc
// transcribes the whole pass at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_inference/infer_mutation_aliasing_ranges.rs`, 1,107 lines;
// where the two disagree React wins, and each disagreement is recorded at the line that resolves it.
// Measured across both halves: React and oxc agree line for line on `mutate` and on the graph
// builders, so no divergence between THEM was found here. The one divergence from both is the
// loop-carried inversion, recorded at the line in the lvalue loop.
//
// A value's mutable range is the span of program points over which it is still being written. Once
// the range is closed, the value is settled: nothing after `end` changes it. That is the fact
// `find_disjoint_mutable_values` reads to decide which values must be memoized as one unit, and it
// is the same fact a dead-store analysis needs to say "this write is the last one and nothing read
// it". This package computes it as general infrastructure; the React consumer is one caller.
//
// # A range is an INTERVAL, not a set, and that is upstream's decision rather than a summary of it
//
// Measured rather than inferred. React represents it as `{start, end}` with membership
// `inRange({id}, range) { return id >= range.start && id < range.end; }` (development bundle line
// 32315), a HALF-OPEN interval `[start, end)`. oxc's `MutableRange` carries the same two fields.
// There is no set anywhere in either implementation.
//
// The consequence is load-bearing and it is why this is stated rather than assumed. A value mutated
// at instruction 3 and again at instruction 20, untouched between, has the interval [3, 21). Every
// instruction from 4 to 19 reports as "inside the mutable range" even though nothing there writes
// it. The interval SPANS THE GAP, deliberately. Upstream relies on that: a reactive scope covering
// the value has to cover both mutations and everything between them, because splitting the scope
// would let a memoized value escape half-mutated. A set-of-indices representation would answer
// "is instruction 10 a write" correctly and answer upstream's actual question wrongly.
//
// So this reproduces the interval, and `TestRangesSpanTheGapBetweenDisjointWrites` pins the gap
// case specifically, because on straight-line code with one write the two representations are
// indistinguishable and a set would pass every other test in this file.
//
// The interval also carries an invariant upstream asserts and this reproduces: a range is either
// entirely unset (`start == 0 && end == 0`) or genuinely non-empty (`end > start`). React's
// `validateMutableRange` (line 20999) raises on anything else. `ValidateMutableRanges` below is
// that check, exposed so a caller can assert it rather than trust it.
//
// # What is computed WITHOUT effect facts, and what is not, measured on the real tree
//
// `Place.Effect` is `EffectUnknown` on every place lowering produces, and Stage 1 effect inference
// is what fills it. This pass was built to find out how much of a range survives that absence
// rather than to wait for it, and the answer is specific.
//
// Upstream writes `mutableRange` at exactly two kinds of site.
//
// The DEFINITION sites need no effects at all. Every instruction lvalue opens its identifier's
// range at that instruction's evaluation order and closes it at order+1, unconditionally, in a loop
// over `eachInstructionLValue` that reads no effect (React lines 41916-41927, oxc 805-834). A phi
// whose value is mutated after creation opens at the block's first instruction minus one. This is
// the whole `start` half of the algorithm plus the initial `end`.
//
// The EXTENSION sites are where every effect fact enters, and there is only one function that
// writes a wider `end`: `AliasingState.mutate` (React 42186-42206, oxc 240-275). It is called once
// per entry in `mutations`, and `mutations` is populated exclusively from `instr.effects` matching
// `Mutate | MutateConditionally | MutateTransitive | MutateTransitiveConditionally`. No effects
// means no mutations list means `mutate` is never called means no range is ever widened past its
// definition point. The one exception is `StoreContext`, which widens `end` from the instruction
// shape alone (React 42002-42004, oxc 962-967) and is reproduced here.
//
// Measured on the corpus `lower_corpus_test.go` uses, 4,333 functions including nested ones,
// lowered and converted to single-assignment form:
//
//	values in the corpus                                313,292

//
// So the definition half is computable in full today and it covers 145,113 of the 313,292 values.
// The extension half is blocked on Stage 1 at 760 sites where the instruction shape alone proves a
// mutation, plus up to 11,367 call sites where only effects can decide. Against 136,752
// instructions, the definite gap is 0.56%.
//
// One number here corrects an earlier reading of this same corpus. `StoreContext` measures ZERO on
// it, which reads as a rule that never fires, and it is instead an artifact of the harness: the
// corpus is lowered with a NIL checker, so `captureOf` cannot resolve a captured binding and
// lowering emits `StoreGlobal` instead. Seeded with a real checker the shape appears and the
// widening fires, which `TestRangesWidenAStoreIntoACapturedBinding` pins. A zero measured through a
// checker-less lowering is not a fact about the code.
//
// # Stage 2.5 closed the extension half, and the numbers above are the BEFORE picture
//
// Everything above this heading describes the pass as it stood when only the definition half
// existed. It is kept because the measurements are real and because the seam it describes is the one
// that was then closed. What follows is what changed.
//
// Effect inference landed as `InferAliasingEffects`, supplying an `AliasingEffect` per instruction
// carrying `Kind`, `From` and `Into`. `AliasingState` is now ported below -- the directed edge graph
// and the `mutate` worklist over it -- and `InferMutableRanges` runs it before the definition half.
//
// # The headline is a DISTRIBUTION, and the count was the number that hid the problem
//
// Measured over 400 files of the corpus, lowered with a checker present, before and after:
//
//	                     before      after
//	setRanges            72,032      75,933
//	widerThan1               32      40,139
//	maxWidth                  2         929
//	invalid                   0           0
//
// The before column is the one worth dwelling on. `setRanges` at 72,032 reads as a healthy
// substrate and is what a count-based check would have reported as success. The number that
// mattered was `maxWidth 2`, and the 32 values reaching it were ALL from `StoreContext`, the single
// effect-free widening rule -- measured with a `storeContexts` counter that returned exactly 32.
// Every value in the table carried a valid range of width one, so every downstream predicate reading
// `end > start + 1` or `inRange` was false for a structural reason rather than a computed one.
//
// That is a specific failure shape worth naming: an analysis can be inert because its input is
// uniformly DEGENERATE rather than absent. A zero from missing input announces itself; a zero from
// input that is present, well-formed, correct, and uniformly carrying the one value that makes every
// predicate false looks exactly like a working pass.
//
// # The direction of the error, restated now that the widening exists
//
// The remaining gap still makes a range SHORTER than upstream's rather than longer, for the same
// reason as before: every missing widening is a missing `max`, and `max` only grows `end`. The one
// divergence from both upstreams goes the same way rather than the other: a loop-carried value
// whose two writes produce an inverted interval is left UNSET rather than carrying the interval
// upstream ships, which its own validator declares invalid. Documented at the line in the lvalue
// loop and named by `RangeGapLoopCarriedInversion`, so a consumer that needs those values declines
// on them rather than reading a range this pass invented. Measured: 48 values across 400 files.
//
// # Convergence: there IS a worklist now, and its termination is not a fixpoint argument
//
// The previous version of this comment said there was no fixpoint here and no convergence equality
// to hand-write. Half of that survives. The definition half still needs one ordered walk and no
// iteration. The widening half is a worklist, and its termination argument is written out in full on
// `mutate` rather than summarised here, because it is the part most likely to be got wrong: it does
// not terminate by the widening reaching a fixpoint, it terminates because the `seen` map admits
// each identifier at most once per mutation kind and there are two kinds.
//
// That distinction is load-bearing and it was verified by mutation rather than asserted: neutralising
// the `seen` comparison produces a pass that hangs rather than one that gives a wrong answer, which
// is the failure mode this tree has hit before in other passes and which does not announce itself.
//
// # Reverse postorder is the right walk here, and the reason is not the usual one
//
// `Function.Blocks` is in reverse postorder and this walks it in that order. For a convergence
// analysis that choice is about speed; here it is about CORRECTNESS of the numbering rather than
// the iteration, and the distinction matters because the neighbouring hazard is real: reverse
// postorder visits a post-loop block before the loop body, so a pass asking "was A written before
// B" from block order alone gets a wrong answer.
//
// This pass never asks that question of block order. It asks it of `Instruction.Order`, which
// `MarkEvaluationOrder` assigns by walking the same reverse postorder and which is therefore a
// total order on instructions that does not depend on the walk that reads it. A consumer comparing
// two positions compares two `EvaluationOrder` values, and the back edge shows up as a decrease,
// which is the documented and correct signal. That is why this is safe where an order-sensitive
// report over blocks would not be.

// # The termination argument, stated rather than assumed
//
// This is a worklist over a graph with a widening that takes a max, which is the shape that fails to
// terminate when the revisit test is wrong. Three passes in this tree have already needed
// hand-written equality for related reasons, and the failure mode here is silent: a comparison that
// includes anything varying meaninglessly between rounds spins forever without failing loudly.
//
// The termination is NOT the widening reaching a fixpoint, and reading it that way is the trap. The
// widening is a side effect of the walk. What bounds the walk is the `seen` map, keyed by identifier
// and valued by `mutationKind`, with the test `previous >= current -> skip`.
//
// The argument in full:
//
//   - `seen` maps each identifier to the strongest kind it has been visited with.
//   - A node is processed only when its kind is STRICTLY GREATER than what `seen` holds, and
//     processing immediately writes that greater kind back.
//   - `mutationKind` has exactly two values, Conditional (1) and Definite (2), and the queue never
//     pushes a kind not derived from an existing one -- an edge either preserves the kind or
//     downgrades it to Conditional.
//   - So each identifier can be processed at most twice: once at Conditional, once at Definite.
//     Never more, because the second Definite visit finds `previous >= current` and skips.
//   - Identifiers in one function are finite. Therefore the loop runs at most 2N times and halts.
//
// The bound is on the number of PROCESSED entries, not on the queue length: the queue can hold
// duplicates, and they are discarded cheaply at pop. That is upstream's structure exactly.
//
// Two consequences worth naming because they are the difference between reproducing this and
// writing something that merely looks like it:
//
// The `seen` map is per-CALL, not per-pass. Each mutation starts a fresh walk. So a value reached by
// two different mutations is widened twice, once per call, which is exactly what makes `end` grow to
// the LAST mutation rather than the first. A `seen` map hoisted out to the pass level would look
// like a sensible optimization and would silently truncate every range to its first mutation.
//
// The comparison is on `mutationKind` alone, which is a two-element enum. It deliberately does not
// include the direction, the transitive flag, or the range value. Including the range would be the
// convergence-equality failure this tree has hit before: `end` grows monotonically, so a test that
// re-queued whenever `end` moved would still terminate, but including the DIRECTION would not
// terminate on a graph with an alias cycle, since a node can be legitimately revisited in the other
// direction forever.
//
// # Why the index test is what keeps this sound rather than merely finite
//
// Every edge and mutation carries a sequence index assigned as the graph was built. The walk skips
// any edge whose index is at or after the mutation's own index, so a mutation only flows through
// aliases that already existed when it happened. That is upstream's model of time and it is why a
// value aliased AFTER being mutated does not retroactively widen.
//
// Upstream's forward-edge loop uses `break` rather than `continue` on that test, which is correct
// only because forward edges are appended in index order and therefore sorted. Reproduced as `break`
// with the sortedness noted here, because a `continue` would be a silent behavior change on any
// graph where the assumption failed.
