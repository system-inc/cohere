// chain becomes real control flow and each join carries a phi. The optionality lives on the
// TERMINAL, not on the `PropertyLoad` inside the block: the load is an ordinary one, and what makes
// the access optional is the branch that guarded reaching it. `optional_chains.go` reads
// `terminal.Optional` when it recovers the path, which is why that is the faithful place for it.

// instruction, which is not what the analyses downstream read: `collectOptionalChainSidemap` matches
// on an `Optional` TERMINAL and the branching around it, so with none it returned empty and the
// optional half of dependency collection never ran. This closes the dot-property portion of
// `DependencyGapOptionalChains`; computed links and optional calls remain declared there.
//
// The block shape, which is upstream's:
//
//	alternate    stores undefined into the result, then breaks to the continuation
//	test         evaluates the object, then branches on it

//	terminal     Optional{Optional: this link tests, Test: test, Fallthrough: continuation}

// alternate when first entering an optional subtree of the ast: if this is a child of an optional
// node, we use the alternate created by the parent". Both links of `a?.b?.c` short circuit to the
