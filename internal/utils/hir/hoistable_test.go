// TestHoistableAnalysisDeepensDependencyPaths is this stage's headline, pinned as a test.
//
// `dependencies.go` shipped with every dependency truncated to its bare root -- 4,426 of 4,426 with
// an empty path -- because `addDependency` stops at the first entry it cannot prove hoistable. The
// measurement that shows this analysis works is therefore the PATH-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION, before and
// after, over 400 corpus files and 677 functions:
//
//	path length      0      1     2     3    4+
//	before        4,426      0     0     0     0
//	after         4,068    421    68     1     1
//
// A length-zero cell that fails to shrink is the tell that the pass is inert, which is why the two
// spellings are both kept and compared rather than the old one being deleted. 491 dependencies gain
// a real path and the total moves from 4,426 to 4,559, because a scope that reported one truncated
// root can report two distinct deeper paths once they stop collapsing together.

	// reading them found what they share: each moves a DIFFERENT quantity by a small amount, and
	// every assertion above was a loose bound that all of them satisfied.
	//
	// Measured, one mutant at a time, against a baseline of 171 deep / 1,434 flat / 2 iterations:
	//
	//	forward join unions instead of intersecting   171 / 1,434, iterations 2 -> 4
	//	active neighbours counted in the join         171 / 1,434, unchanged
	//	backward direction dropped                    169 / 1,435, two paths lost
	//	immutability gate always true                 172 / 1,433, one path GAINED
	//	component seed ungated                        171 / 1,434, unchanged
	//
	// The distinguishing quantity is a COUNT OVER A TABLE rather than any named value, which is why
	// the exact figures are asserted here. The immutability row is the one that matters most: a
	// mutant that GAINS a path is moving in the over-approximating direction, the one that invents
	// crashes, and only an exact count can see it -- every "at least one deep path" assertion in
	// this file passes happily while it does so.
	//
	// These numbers move when the corpus does. That is accepted: a failure here should be read as
	// "the corpus changed, re-measure" rather than as a defect, and the alternative is a suite that
	// cannot see the mutations that matter.
	// `flat` moved 1,434 -> 1,435 when the four `Object` statics were declared in the effect table.
	// `deep` held at 171, which is the direction that matters: a gain there is over-approximation.
	// One more dependency became visible because `Object.keys(record)` stopped being assumed to
	// mutate `record`, which is the fix working rather than the analysis drifting.
	// # Both counts moved when `fixScopeRanges` landed, and the direction reads as over-approximation
	//
	// Porting React's `fixScopeAndIdentifierRanges` (`HIRBuilder.ts:940-955`) took `deep` from 171 to
	// 237 and `flat` from 1,435 to 2,205. A gain in `deep` is the direction this comment warns about,
	// and it is accepted here on evidence rather than waved through.
	//
	// The evidence is the dependency oracle, which scores our inferred dependencies against the cache
	// slots in upstream's own compiled output. It moved from 70 matched of 87 to 72, recovering `cb`
	// on `useCallback-captures-reassigned-context-property` and `shouldShowMessage` on
	// `useCallback-nonescaping-invoked-callback-escaping-return`. Both are dependencies upstream
	// infers and we did not.
	//
	// So these ranges were WRONG before, not conservative: a scope whose range did not contain its
	// own instructions made the hoistable analysis unable to prove accesses it should have proven.
	// Measured, scopes covering the order of none of their own members: 2,345 of 3,357 before the
	// fix, 0 after.
	//
	// The honest caveat is that the oracle's production count moved 151 to 158 in the same change,
	// so five of the seven additional dependencies are not ones upstream infers. That is a real cost
	// and it is recorded rather than buried; it is smaller than two recovered true dependencies and
	// a corrected invariant.
	//
	// # Both counts moved again when `isDeferredDependency` landed, and this gain in `deep` is NOT
	// over-approximation
	//
	// Transcribing upstream's `isDeferredDependency` -- skip an instruction whose lvalue is in the
	// temporaries sidemap, because the instruction reading that temporary records the full path at
	// its site of use -- took `deep` from 237 to 386 and `flat` from 2,205 to 2,136.
	//
	// The heading above says a gain in `deep` is the over-approximating direction unless something
	// says otherwise, and the oracle cannot: it moved not at all (72 matched of 87, ours 158). So
	// the evidence is a direct diff of the two dependency sets over this same corpus instead, which
	// is a stronger answer than the oracle's 87 scored slots could give here.
	//
	// Measured, every dependency in both sets: 71 bare roots removed, 147 specific paths added,
	// every added path an extension of a root that was removed, and every removed root replaced by
	// at least one path. Nothing was dropped and no new root appeared. `AccordionItem.tsx` is the
	// shape: bare `properties` in two scopes became `properties.icon` and `properties.title`.
	//
	// That is the opposite of over-approximation -- a scope that invalidated on all of `properties`
	// now invalidates on the one field it reads -- and it is why the total rises while the answer
	// gets narrower. One bare root that swallowed N deep paths becomes N paths.
	// # And again when the dependency collector learned to descend into nested functions
	//
	// 386 deep to 589, 2,136 flat to 2,088. Larger than either previous move, and this time the
	// heading's own condition is satisfied: an oracle does say otherwise. The dependency oracle
	// rises 68 to 69, and a per-golden dump before and after differs by exactly one row out of 116 --
	// `x.y.z` in `useCallback-infer-more-specific.ts` going from miss to hit. Nothing was traded.
	//
	// The direction is the same narrowing as the entry above, for the same reason. `useCallback(() =>
	// [x.y.z], [x])` reads `x.y.z` only inside the callback, so the outer function saw the capture
	// and recorded bare `x`. The walk recovers the path, and one root that swallowed a deep path
	// becomes the deep path.
	// # And again when the analysis learned to descend into invoked callbacks
	//
	// 589 deep to 600, 2,088 flat to 2,087. Eleven dependencies that had truncated to a bare root
	// now carry a path, which is the narrowing direction: a scope that invalidated on all of `x`
	// now invalidates on the field the callback actually reads.
	//
	// The oracle is unmoved -- 76 matched of 88, ours 158 against upstream's 116, identical before
	// and after -- so it cannot adjudicate this one either way. What it CAN say is that nothing was
	// lost: `matched` did not fall and `ours` did not rise, so no dependency was dropped and none
	// was invented. The eleven are on corpus files rather than on scored fixtures.
	// # And again when `.current` reads stopped being dependencies
	//
	// 600 deep to 595, 2,087 flat to 2,092. Five paths truncated to their roots, which is this
	// change's whole point rather than a side effect: upstream's `visitDependency` does the same
	// with the comment "ref.current access is not a valid dep", because a scope must depend on the
	// ref object rather than on the mutable slot inside it.
	//
	// A FALL in `deep` is the direction this heading calls safe, and the oracle agrees it cost
	// nothing: 78 matched of 88 with `ours` at 158, identical before and after.
	// # And again when the dependency array stopped being evidence
	//
	// 595 deep to 574, 2,092 flat to 2,097. Twenty-one paths truncated toward their roots, and this
	// is the change's point rather than a side effect: the loads that built a memo call's written
	// dependency array were seeding the non-null set, so a path the developer merely declared was
	// licensing the walk to descend past it. Upstream's elimination deletes those loads two hundred
	// lines before its dependency analysis runs, so it never has the option.
	//
	// The scale is the informative part. Every earlier attempt on this cluster suppressed evidence
	// at the collector instead -- a spine walk and then a post-dominance predicate over the whole
	// function -- and took this number to 120 and then 268, four fifths and half of all path depth
	// corpus-wide. Fixing the set that licenses depth rather than the walk that consumes it moves it
	// 3.5%, and the paths that truncate are ones a memo call declared.
	//
	// The dependency oracle falls by exactly one row and it is named at `knownMatched`: the same
	// fixture that gains a false positive, for the optional-chain reason recorded there.
	// # And again when a context binding stopped being versioned
	//
	// 574 deep unchanged, 2,097 flat to 2,101. Four more flat dependencies and no change in depth,
	// which is what one identifier serving several writes should produce: the same accesses resolve
	// to one value instead of several, so a scope names the binding once more often and no path
	// gets shorter or longer.
	// # And again when a hook's parameters became frozen
	//
	// 574 deep to 563, 2,101 flat to 2,134. Eleven fewer paths and 33 more bare dependencies, for a
	// net of 22 more overall. Both halves follow from the same cause: a conditional mutation no
	// longer widens a frozen value's range, so values that used to be swept into a neighbouring
	// scope now stand alone. More scopes name a dependency, and fewer of those dependencies sit
	// deep enough inside a widened range to carry a path.
	//
	// `deep` FALLING is the safe direction by this test's own rule -- a gain in depth is the
	// over-approximating one -- and the scope oracle agrees rather than merely not objecting:
	// surviving scopes 114 to 108 against upstream's 97, and exact per-fixture agreement 26 to 30.
	// # And again when three `Object.*` entries gained their aliasing signatures
	//
	// 563 deep unchanged, 2,134 flat to 2,135. One more bare dependency and no change in depth,
	// which is what a capture edge that did not exist before should produce: `Object.values(o)` now
	// records that the result holds the object's own values, so a scope naming the result names the
	// object once more often, and no path gets longer or shorter.
