// Reactive scopes: which values are memoized together, and over what span.
//
// This is React's `inferReactiveScopeVariables` (development bundle line 32231), run over this
// graph. oxc transcribes it at
// `oxc_react_compiler/src/react_compiler_inference/infer_reactive_scope_variables.rs`; where the two
// disagree React wins, and each disagreement is recorded at the line that resolves it.
//
// # What this pass actually does, which is less than its name suggests
//
// `FindDisjointMutableValues` has already answered the hard question: which values are so entangled
// by mutation that they cannot be memoized apart. This pass does three mechanical things with that
// answer and nothing else.
//
//	one scope per equivalence class, with a fresh id
//	the scope's range is the HULL of its members' mutable ranges
//	every member's range is REWRITTEN to the hull
//
// The third is the one a reader does not expect, and it is not incidental. Upstream writes
// `identifier.mutableRange = scope.range` on the line after it writes `identifier.scope`
// (line 32261), so after this pass every member of a class reports the CLASS's range rather than
// its own. A consumer asking "how long is this value alive" gets the entangled answer, which is the
// point: two values in one scope are memoized as one unit and therefore live as one unit.
//
// # DIVERGENCE FROM React: the hull is a VALUE here and an ALIAS there
//
// React's `range: identifier.mutableRange` binds the first member's range OBJECT into the scope,
// and `identifier.mutableRange = scope.range` then points every member at that same object. The
// aliasing is load-bearing THERE: five later passes widen `scope.range`
// (`alignReactiveScopesToBlockScopes`, `alignMethodCallScopes`, `alignObjectMethodScopes`,
// `mergeOverlappingReactiveScopes`, and the fbt/macro pass), and each widening retroactively
// updates every member's `mutableRange` through the shared reference.
//
// `MutableRange` is a value type here and this stores a copy, exactly as oxc does
// (`infer_reactive_scope_variables.rs:91-100`, a fixup loop rather than an alias). None of those
// five widening passes exists in this tree, so today the alias and the copy are indistinguishable:
// nothing widens a scope range after this pass runs. The difference becomes real the moment one of
// those passes lands, and at that point `ScopeRanges` below is the seam that must be re-derived
// rather than read once. Recorded as `ScopeGapPostAlignmentWidening` so a consumer can decline on
// it, and named here because a reader diffing against the bundle would otherwise see the alias
// missing with no explanation.
//
// # Upstream's invariant is an INVARIANT, not a filter, and it holds on this corpus
//
// React ends with a hard `CompilerError.invariant` (line 32271) rejecting any scope whose range
// starts at zero, ends at zero, or ends past `maxInstruction + 1`. There is no branch that skips
// such a scope: upstream considers it a compiler bug and stops.
//
// That is a genuine risk here rather than a formality, because `RangeGapLoopCarriedInversion` leaves
// 48 values across 400 files with an UNSET range, and a class composed entirely of those would hull
// to [0,0) and trip the invariant. Measured before this file was written, over 400 corpus files and
// 685 outermost functions:
//
//	classes                                        3,306
//	classes with every member's range set          3,278
//	classes with SOME member unset                    28
//	classes with EVERY member unset                    0
//
//	hulls that are empty (start or end zero)           0
//	hulls that are inverted (end <= start)             0
//	hulls that end past maxInstruction + 1             0
//
// So the invariant holds on every class, and the 28 mixed classes are exactly what upstream's
// `start === 0` branch exists to handle. `ValidateScopes` returns the violations rather than
// panicking, because a linter that stops on a graph it dislikes is worse than one that declines a
// function, and `TestScopeRangesSatisfyUpstreamsInvariant` pins the zero.
//
// # The distribution that proves these scopes are real
//
// A count cannot distinguish genuine structure from catastrophic over-merging, so the headline is a
// CROSS-TABULATION of scope width against scope membership. Over the same 400 files:
//
//	                       width 1      width > 1
//	one member               1,903             80
//	many members                 0          1,323
//
// The empty cell is the result. Not one class of several values hulls to a single instruction --
// which is precisely the shape catastrophic over-merging would produce, values swept together into
// a span too narrow to hold them. The two dimensions are measured independently and they agree.
//
// The counterfactual says which mechanism produces which population. Neutralising `mayAllocate` to
// false collapses the width-1 singletons from 1,903 to 193 while the wide multi-member scopes hold
// at 1,203 of 1,323. So allocation is what mints the narrow single-value scopes, and the entangled
// wide ones come from the range and mutability gates instead. Two populations, two causes, neither
// an artifact of the other. `TestScopeWidthAndMembershipAgree` pins the empty cell.
//
// # Termination is a single pass with no iteration at all
//
// There is no worklist, no fixpoint, and no recursion. `AssignReactiveScopes` makes ONE pass over
// the classes `DisjointSet.Sets()` returns, and one pass over the members of each. Every class is
// visited exactly once and every member exactly once, so the work is linear in the number of
// members and terminates because both loops are over finite slices fixed before the walk begins.
//
// This is a weaker claim than Stage 3 needed and deliberately so: the union-find whose termination
// had to be argued is upstream of this file, and its answer is already final by the time this reads
// it. `TestScopeAssignmentIsASinglePass` pins it empirically by counting visits.
//
// # Determinism, which a Go map would otherwise destroy
//
// Scope ids are assigned in the order `Sets()` returns classes, and that order is sorted by first
// member rather than being a Go map's randomised iteration. Upstream's ids come from a counter on
// the Environment (`fn.env.nextScopeId`, a post-increment shared across nested functions), so ITS
// ids are stable because its backing `Map` is insertion-ordered. Ours are stable because `Sets()`
// sorts. Without that, the same function would produce different scope ids on different runs, which
// is the shape that makes a cache non-reproducible without ever producing a wrong answer.
//
// Ids are per-function here rather than per-environment, because this graph has no environment and
// a `Function` is the unit every other pass in this package takes. See `ScopeId`.
package hir

// ScopeId names one reactive scope within one function.
//
// Upstream draws these from a counter on the Environment, so a scope id is unique across every
// function the compiler touches in a run. There is no environment in this package -- `Function` is
// the unit every pass here takes -- so these are unique within a function and restart at 1 for the
// next one. A consumer holding scopes from two functions must key on the pair, exactly as it must
// for `IdentifierId`, and for the same reason `FindDisjointMutableValues` refuses to span functions.
//
// Zero is not a valid scope id. It is the absent value, which is what lets `ScopeOf` answer "no
// scope" without a second return.
type ScopeId uint32

// ScopeGap names a scope rule this pass cannot apply, for a caller that needs to know.

// ReactiveScopes is the table this pass produces: one scope per equivalence class, plus the

//
// # Why a side table rather than the Identifier.Scope field that already exists
//
// `Identifier` carries a `Scope any` field, declared by lowering as "reserved for reactive-scope
// construction, which may never run". Using it would cost no edit to `hir.go` and would match
// upstream, which stores the scope ON the identifier. This does not use it, for two reasons that
// are about this tree rather than about design taste.
//
// The field is typed `any`. Filling it means every consumer writes a type assertion, and a wrong
// assertion is a runtime panic in a linter rather than a compile error. Typing it properly means
// editing `hir.go`, which is the shared, contended file that `MutableRanges` explicitly declined to
// touch for exactly this reason -- and `ranges.go` is uncommitted in the working tree right now,
// held by another stage.
//
// The second reason is the one that would apply even in a quiet tree: a value's scope is not a
// property of the value, it is a property of the CLASS the value belongs to, and there are 3,306
// classes over 26,962 members. Storing the scope per identifier stores the same answer 8.16 times
// on average and invites the two copies to drift. The table below stores each scope once and indexes
// into it, so widening a scope is one write rather than a fan-out, which is exactly the operation
// `ScopeGapPostAlignmentWidening` says a later pass will need.
//
// The cost is one indirection and one thing a caller must hold, the same trade `MutableRanges` made.
// If scopes become permanent infrastructure, `ScopeOf` is the seam that makes moving them onto
// `Identifier` invisible to callers.
