// The identifier graph `pruneNonEscapingScopes` walks, and the propagation over it.
//
// This is React's `State`, `IdentifierNode`, `ScopeNode` and `computeMemoizedIdentifiers`
// (`ReactiveScopes/PruneNonEscapingScopes.ts` at `reactconformance.UpstreamSha`).
//
// # Keyed on DeclarationId, deliberately, and not to be improved
//
// Upstream's comment is explicit and worth keeping: this pass models data flow rather than control
// flow, so it wants every value that may flow into one program variable regardless of the path
// taken. `DeclarationId` groups exactly those; `IdentifierId` would split them by
// single-assignment version and the pass would then reason about paths it does not model.
//
// The comment also says the change becomes correct once the pass is control-flow aware, which it is
// not. Do not "fix" this.
//
// # Cycles, and why a node is marked non-memoized while its dependencies are visited
//
// The walk is depth-first from the escaping roots. A cycle would otherwise recurse forever, so a
// node sets `seen` and answers `false` before descending -- a temporary lie that is corrected on the
// way back up. Upstream does the same and says so; the alternative, a fixpoint, would be slower for
// no gain because the answer only ever moves one way.
