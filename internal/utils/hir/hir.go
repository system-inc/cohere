// Package hir is a high-level intermediate representation of one JavaScript or TypeScript
// function: a control-flow graph whose blocks hold three-address instructions over named values,
// rather than a tree of syntax.
//
// It answers questions the AST cannot answer without the asker reimplementing control flow. Which
// values reach this point. Whether this call happens on every path or only some. Whether the thing
// passed here is the same object that was mutated there. A rule written against the AST that wants
// any of those either approximates them or walks the tree a second time with its own notion of
// order, and verify already holds three rules doing exactly that.
//
// # The decision this package makes, and why
//
// verify already has a basic-block control-flow graph in `internal/utils/controlflow`, with
// predecessor edges, a dominator tree, and a monotone dataflow solver. It also has a resident
// whole-program type checker. The obvious move was therefore a thin IR: keep pointing at AST nodes,
// lean on the existing graph for control flow, and add only the value naming on top. That would be
// less code and would duplicate nothing.
//
// It was rejected, and the reason is a property of the existing graph rather than a preference.
//
// `controlflow.Build` is an event recorder, not a lowering. A consumer supplies `Hooks` and
// receives callbacks at reads, writes, statements, and expressions; it calls `Emit` to append its
// own event type to whatever block is current. The graph itself stores `Events []E` and
// `Successors []*Block[E]` and nothing else. There is no per-block record of which AST node was
// laid out where, no notion of an ordered value produced by an expression, and no way to ask the
// builder for the block a given subexpression landed in. A consumer sees the positions the walk
// passes through, in order, and must reconstruct meaning from that stream alone.
//
// That is sufficient for the questions its four consumers ask, all of which are of the form "did
// event A occur before event B on this path". It is not sufficient to name values. The specific
// obstruction: for `f(g(x), h(y))` the hooks fire at each identifier read, but nothing reports that
// `g(x)` produced a value, that the value is the first argument to `f`, or which of the two calls
// the current block belongs to when they fork. Recovering that means walking the expression tree
// alongside the graph and re-deriving evaluation order — which is lowering, performed by the
// consumer, without the builder's cooperation, once per consumer.
//
// The second obstruction is layout. `controlflow` deliberately reproduces ESLint's code-path
// shape, and two of its properties are wrong for an IR:
//
//   - A `finally` body is laid out TWICE, once for normal completion and once for the abrupt path.
//     Both copies carry the same source positions. An IR whose instructions are keyed by position
//     would give a value two definitions that are not a merge of each other, and single-assignment
//     construction over that produces a phi where the source has no join.
//   - A `try` whose body cannot throw gets NO edge to its `catch`, and the first throwable node in
//     a body forks to the handler so later statements are bypassed on the throwing path. That is
//     the right answer for reachability and the wrong one for a mutation lattice, which needs the
//     handler to see the state the body actually left behind.
//
// So this package lowers independently, and the duplication is real and accepted. What it buys is
// that the two graphs answer different questions and neither is bent to serve the other:
// `controlflow` keeps mirroring ESLint for the rules whose observable behaviour depends on that,
// and this keeps mirroring React's HIR for the passes that will be ported onto it. A shared graph
// would have to be both, and the finally-duplication alone makes that impossible.
//
// # Why the shape mirrors React's compiler rather than being designed fresh
//
// The instruction and terminal sets here are upstream's, near name-for-name. That is a deliberate
// cost: some of it is redundant with what the type checker already knows, and a from-scratch design
// for verify would be smaller.
//
// It is paid for one reason. React ships 325 error fixtures with plain-text expectations, vendored
// at `internal/reactconformance`, and they are the only external oracle this project has for
// whether a mid-end is correct. Every pass that will be built on this IR - single-assignment form,
// type inference, effect inference, the validators - exists upstream in a form that reads against
// this exact shape. Diverging on the IR means every ported pass becomes a rewrite whose correctness
// is judged by its author, and the fixtures stop discriminating. Matching means a pass can be
// ported and then scored, and a wrong answer is visible as a number.
//
// A measurable wrong answer beats an unmeasurable right one. That is the whole argument, and it is
// the reason to prefer fidelity here specifically, not everywhere.
//
// Where upstream's shape is a workaround for something verify does not have, this diverges and says
// so at the divergence. The two standing cases:
//
//   - Upstream carries an `Environment` holding arenas for identifiers, scopes, functions, and
//     types, because its passes need shared mutable references that Rust will not give them.
//     `Function` here owns its own tables. There is no cross-function arena, because nothing in a
//     lint pipeline compiles two functions into one graph, and a package-level arena would make
//     every pass take a parameter it does not use.
//   - Upstream's `typeinference` crate exists to infer what verify's checker already knows.
//     `Identifier.Node` is retained on every value that came from a syntactic source precisely so a
//     later pass can hand that node to the checker instead of inferring. That field is the seam;
//     see its comment.
//
// # What is React-specific, and where it lives
//
// Measured against upstream at the pinned reading: 43 instruction values of which 5 are React
// (`JsxExpression`, `JsxFragment`, `JsxText`, `StartMemoize`, `FinishMemoize`), and 22 terminals of
// which 2 are React (`Scope`, `PrunedScope`).
//
// All 5 instruction values are HERE, in the core set. Of the 2 terminals, `Scope` is now here and
// `PrunedScope` is not. The paragraphs below describe the state before reactive scopes were built
// and the rule that governed it; they are kept because the rule still governs `PrunedScope`, and
// because the condition they name is exactly the one that was met. See the end of this section.
//
// The split is not a compromise between them, and the asymmetry is the point.
//
// JSX is React-specific only in name. It is syntax the parser accepts, it appears in the middle of
// ordinary expressions, and lowering must produce something for it or refuse the function outright.
// An extension seam for it would mean either an `Extension` variant carrying an opaque payload -
// which every consuming pass must then handle blindly, defeating exhaustive matching, the main
// safety property of a closed instruction set - or refusing to lower JSX at all, which discards
// most of the corpus. Three variants for syntax the language grammar has is not contamination; it
// is the same category as `TaggedTemplateExpression`. `StartMemoize` and `FinishMemoize` are
// markers a later pass inserts and a later pass reads; they cost one variant each and carry no
// semantics that any other pass must understand.
//
// `Scope` and `PrunedScope` are genuinely different. They are not syntax and they are not markers -
// they are the output of React's reactive-scope construction, which is 10,980 lines upstream, the
// largest module in the compiler, and contributes nothing to the 15 rules verify wants. A terminal
// is the block's control flow; adding two variants that no lowering ever produces and no generic
// pass can interpret would put a permanent hole in every `switch` over `Terminal` for a pass that
// may never be written. If reactive scopes are ever built, they add two variants then, and every
// exhaustive switch goes red and gets read by a human. That is the correct time to pay it.
//
// THAT MOMENT ARRIVED, for one of the two. Reactive scopes are built: `scopes.go` assigns them,
// `align_scopes.go` and `merge_scopes.go` bring them to the shape upstream's own
// `assertValidBlockNesting` demands, and `scope_terminals.go` rewrites the graph to carry them.
// `Scope` is therefore in the core set, added in the same commit as the pass that constructs it.
// Every exhaustive switch did go red and was read; two more had a `default` arm and were found by
// enumeration rather than by the compiler, which is the failure mode this paragraph did not
// anticipate and the next person adding a variant should expect. `PrunedScope` stays out under the
// unchanged rule: the four passes that construct it are not ported, so it would be a variant nothing
// produces -- the exact shape of `Optional`, which this package already carries as a warning.
//
// The rule this follows, stated so the next person can apply it rather than re-litigate it: a
// variant belongs in the core set when LOWERING must produce it, and belongs behind a seam when
// only a LATER PASS would produce it and no other pass must interpret it. Lowering produces JSX
// because the grammar does. Nothing lowers to a reactive scope.
//
// # What this package deliberately does not do
//
// Single-assignment form is NOT what lowering produces, and is a separate opt-in pass. Straight out
// of `Lower`, values are named but not uniquely defined: a `let` reassigned in a loop is several
// `Identifier`s sharing one `DeclarationId`, each store mints a fresh one, and a read binds to
// whichever store the lowering WALK saw last rather than to the one that reaches it on the path.
// That last part is the important one: the pre-SSA graph's reads are lexically correct and
// dataflow-wrong at any join, so a pass must not read them as reaching definitions.
//
// `Construct` in ssa.go is what makes them reaching definitions, and it also fills `Block.Phis`.
// A pass that reasons about values should run it; a pass that only walks control flow need not.
//
// No type inference, no effect inference, no optimisation, and no rule. `Place.Effect` and
// `Identifier.Type` exist, are threaded through lowering, and are left at their zero values -
// `EffectUnknown` and nil. They are declared for the same reason `Phis` is: a pass that adds a
// field mid-flight is a pass that invalidates every existing match.
