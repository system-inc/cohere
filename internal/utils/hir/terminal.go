// 21 variants. Upstream has 22; the one absent is `PrunedScope`, which later passes
// (`flattenReactiveLoopsHIR`, `flattenScopesWithHooksOrUseHIR`, `pruneUnusedScopes`,
// `pruneAlwaysInvalidatingScopes`) construct and none of which exists here. `Scope` was absent for
// the same reason until `BuildReactiveScopeTerminals` landed to construct it; see that terminal's
// comment for why the cost was paid at that moment and not earlier. See hir.go's package comment for
// the rule that puts JSX in the core instruction set and kept these outside it.
//
// # Fallthrough, and why every structured terminal carries one
//
// A terminal names its successors by id. Most also name a `Fallthrough`: the block where control
// resumes after the whole construct completes, whichever way it went.
//
// That field is not redundant with the successor edges, and it is the single most important thing
// to understand about this IR. It is what distinguishes an `If` from two arbitrary jumps that
// happen to reconverge. Without it, the graph records that control forked and later merged, and
// recovering "this was an if-statement, and this block is what comes after it" means finding the
// immediate post-dominator and hoping it corresponds to a syntactic construct. With it, the
// structure the source had is preserved through every pass that maintains the field.
//
// Two consequences the next reader should hold:
//
//   - Fallthrough is NOT a control-flow edge. Control reaches it through the arms, not from the
//     terminal directly. `EachSuccessor` therefore does not yield it by default, and
//     `MarkPredecessors` does not lay an edge to it. A dataflow analysis that treated it as an edge
//     would propagate values along a path that does not exist.
//   - It is nonetheless reachable-from in the graph sense, so a pass that walks only real edges
//     still visits it, via whichever arm reaches it.

// other; single-assignment construction over that mints a phi at a point the source has no join,

// whether an event occurs on every path, which is what that graph's consumers ask. It is wrong for

// `controlflow` forks to the handler at the FIRST throwable node in a try body, so later statements
// are bypassed on the throwing path, and gives a body that cannot throw NO edge to its catch at all.

// observe the state the body actually left behind - including from a body the analysis believes
// cannot throw, because "cannot throw" is a judgement that a later, more precise pass may revise.

// pass runs a function contains none, and every consumer written against a freshly lowered graph
// may still assume the terminal set it knew.
//
// # Why this variant exists now, when the package comment said it might never
//
// `hir.go` records the rule: a variant belongs in the core set when LOWERING must produce it, and
// behind a seam when only a LATER PASS would, and it names the moment to pay the cost as "if
// reactive scopes are ever built". They are built. Four stages before this one declined to add the
// variant early and were right to: a terminal nothing constructs is worse than no terminal, because
// consumers switch on it and get an arm that never fires. `Optional` is the standing example in this
// package. This variant is added in the same commit as its producer, and `TestScopeTerminalsAreBuilt`
// pins the constructed count so it can never quietly become a second one.
//
// # The shape, and the one divergence from React
//
// Upstream's terminal embeds the scope OBJECT (`scope: ReactiveScope`); oxc holds a `ScopeId`
// (`react_compiler_hir/mod.rs:452`). This holds the id, matching oxc, for a reason that is about
// this tree rather than a preference between them: reactive scopes live in a side table here
// (`ReactiveScopes`, `AlignedScopes`, `MergedScopes`) precisely so a widening is one write rather
// than a fan-out, and embedding the object would reintroduce the aliasing that `scopes.go` declined
// and put two copies of a range in the graph. A consumer wanting the range asks the table it already
// holds. Recorded as a divergence because a reader diffing against the bundle will see it.
//
// `Block` is where the scope's body begins and is a real successor. `Fallthrough` is where control
// resumes after the scope completes, and is NOT an edge, exactly as for every other structured
// terminal. See this file's header.
