// TestPreserveManualMemoizationAgainstGoldens scores the rule against upstream's own answers.
//
// This is the first independent oracle in phase 6. Every other stage was verified by conservation
// properties, mutation sweeps and cross-checks of my own design; this one has an answer key written
// by the people who wrote the rule.
//
// # What it asserts, and what it deliberately does not
//
// It does NOT assert that all 33 pass. Scoring a fresh port against a golden set and demanding a
// perfect number is how a rule ends up shaped like its fixtures: the failures get patched
// individually until the count is right, and the result matches the corpus rather than the
// specification.
//
// What it asserts is that the rule RUNS on the corpus and produces a non-degenerate answer -- it
// fires on some fixtures and not others -- plus the current pass count as a floor, so the number can
// only be driven up. The count is logged rather than pinned exactly, and the floor moves when
// someone improves it.

		// Flow's `component Component(id) { ... }` declaration form is EXCLUDED, deliberately,
		// because the vendored TypeScript parser does not model it and no work in this package can
		// recover it.
		//
		// # What the parser actually produces, measured rather than assumed
		//
		// There is no `KindComponentDeclaration` anywhere in `typescript-go`, and the parser does
		// not reject the syntax either -- it RECOVERS, into three unrelated top-level nodes:
		//
		//	component            ->  ExpressionStatement(Identifier)
		//	Component(id)        ->  ExpressionStatement(CallExpression)
		//	{ ... }              ->  Block                       (a detached block, not a body)
		//
		// So `ForEachFunctionLike` finds no function for the component. It descends into that
		// detached `Block` and reaches the `useMemo`/`useCallback` CALLBACKS, which are ordinary
		// arrow functions, and lowers each one as though it were itself a top-level component. That
		// is why these two fixtures report `lowered=true` with reactive scopes and yet record zero
		// written dependencies: the `useMemo` CALL SITES live in the detached block, which is never
		// lowered, so `DropManualMemoization` is never handed a call to recognise and no
		// `StartMemoize` marker is ever constructed. The identical program written as
		// `function Component(id)` lowers to one function with two markers carrying their deps,
		// which is the control.
		//
		// # Why this is not repairable downstream
		//
		// Lowering is keyed on `*ast.Symbol` identity throughout -- `builder.declarations`,
		// `.identifiers` and `.captured` are all symbol-keyed. The binder never created a parameter
		// binding for `id`, because there is no function to bind one into, so
		// `GetSymbolAtLocation(id)` returns nil at its declaration site AND at its use inside the
		// dependency array, while resolving at an unrelated use. A dependency-array entry with no
		// symbol cannot be built into a `ManualMemoDependency` and cannot be compared against an
		// inferred dependency, so synthesising a function node here would produce a marker whose
		// operands name nothing. The gap is in the parser, above `Lower`, and closing it means
		// teaching `typescript-go` a Flow production.
		//
		// # Why they are counted as unsupported rather than filtered out
		//
		// Dropping them would move the denominator to 31 and hide the exclusion inside a number.
		// They stay in `len(mine)` and land in `unsupported`, which is the bucket this test already
		// uses for a program it declines to judge, so the 33 keeps matching the corpus and the cost
		// of the exclusion stays visible on the log line.
		//
		// Both are named `todo-repro` upstream, and the second's own comments describe a capture

	// # This assertion exists because its absence nearly shipped a regression as an improvement
	//
	// The clean-fixture rate below is pinned exactly and this side was not, so the two instruments
	// were asymmetric in the one direction that matters: a change trading true positives away for
	// false-positive removals moved the pinned number DOWN, which reads as the rule improving, while
	// this side stayed green because it only asked for a non-zero.
	//
	// That is not hypothetical. Freezing component parameters in the aliasing graph took the clean
	// rate from 31 to 19 and this number from 15 to 9 in the same run. Reported through the
	// instruments as they stood, that is "false positives down 39%" with no signal at all that six
	// programs upstream reports on had gone silent.
	//
	// The six were `error.useMemo-aliased-var` plus five optional-member-expression fixtures, and
	// what they show is that the repair was in the wrong pass. Freezing a parameter suppressed the
	// walk that carries a mutation ONWARD, so `x.push(props?.items)` stopped widening `x`, which is
	// mutated, rather than `props`, which is not. Upstream does not do this: oxc's `NodeValue` in
	// `infer_mutation_aliasing_ranges.rs:72` is `Object | Phi` with no third element, and the
	// parameter freeze lives in `InferMutationAliasingEffects` as a `MutateFrozen` EFFECT rather
	// than as a node value this pass reads.
	//
	// So both directions are pinned, and a change moving either one has to say which it moved and
	// why. Silence is not the right answer on ANY of these 33: each is a program where upstream
	// reports a lost memoization.
	// Raised from 15 by turning on the third firing condition, which had been gated since it was
	// written. The gate's own unblock instruction was "turn this on when the hoistable analysis
	// lands", and it did: `CollectHoistablePropertyLoads` populates the tree, the collector descends
	// into nested functions and into callbacks it can assume are invoked, and 595 dependencies carry
	// a path against 2,092 that do not -- where the gate was written, 171 did against 1,435.
	//
	// The four recovered are the fixtures whose golden says the inferred dependency did not match
	// the written one, which is the only condition that can report them.
	// Raised from 19 by two changes in `hoistable.go` that are inert apart and worth six together:
	// the developer's own dependency array stops seeding the non-null set, and an invoked callback
	// contributes what its entry block proves rather than what any of its blocks prove.
	//
	// The first is a pipeline difference. Upstream drops manual memoization at `Pipeline.ts:168`,
	// eliminates dead code at 230 and analyses dependencies at 428, and its elimination keeps the
	// memo markers while pruning `PropertyLoad` and `ArrayExpression`. So the loads that built the
	// array are gone before anything reads them. This tree keeps them, and reading them treats the
	// developer's declared `propB.x.y` as proof that `propB.x` is non-null -- then infers a deeper
	// dependency than they wrote and reports the disagreement it just manufactured.
	//
	// The second is `CollectHoistablePropertyLoads.ts:449`, which takes one block's answer from the
	// nested analysis. That block's set is post-propagation, and propagation intersects across
	// neighbours, so it holds exactly what the callback reads on every path. It is the only thing
	// that separates `useMemo-conditional-access-noAlloc.ts`, whose body reads `propB?.x.y`
	// unconditionally and where upstream keeps the deep path, from
	// `useMemo-infer-less-specific-conditional-access.ts`, whose body reads it under an `if` and
	// where upstream infers bare `propB`. Their outer functions are nearly identical; only the
	// callback's control flow tells them apart.
	//
	// Measured apart: the array exclusion alone is 20, the entry-block read alone is 19, together
	// 25. The `dependencies.go` block gate in the same commit reads flat on its own and drops this
	// to 20 when removed from the combined state, so it is latent rather than inert -- it only pays
	// once the hoistable set stops over-approximating.
	// Lowered from 25 to 24 by the parameter exemption recorded at `knownFalsePositives`, and the
	// cost is one fixture, named because lowering this number is otherwise a retreat:
	// `error.useMemo-aliased-var.ts`.
	//
	//	const aliasedX = x; const aliasedProp = x.y.z;
	//	useMemo(() => [x, x.y.z], [aliasedX, aliasedProp])
	//
	// Its own header reads "This is technically a false positive, but source is already breaking
	// `exhaustive-deps` lint rule (and can be considered invalid)" -- upstream reports it while
	// saying it should not have to, the same category as the `todo-repro` fixtures elsewhere in this
	// corpus. Ten false positives for that one.
	// Raised from 24 by defining a context binding once in SSA rather than versioning every write.
	// Both fixtures this rule's scope conditions were missing now fire:
	//
	//	new-mutability/error.invalid-useCallback-captures-reassigned-context.js
	//	preserve-memo-validation/error.invalid-useCallback-captures-reassigned-context.ts
	//
	// See the note at `defineIn` in `ssa.go`. Upstream's two writes to such a binding name one
	// identifier, which is what puts the declaration and the reassignment in one disjoint class so
	// the scope spans the memo block between them.
	//
	// Costs two fixtures, both of which upstream itself flags:
	// `error.todo-repro-unmemoized-callback-captured-in-context-variable.tsx` carries the
	// `todo-repro` prefix, and `error.useMemo-aliased-var.ts` says in its own header "This is
	// technically a false positive, but source is already breaking `exhaustive-deps`". Two real
	// detections for two upstream calls a mistake.
	//
	// 27 once a ref's stability is decided the way upstream decides it, in `reactive.go`. The two
	// that close are `error.ref-like-name-not-a-ref.js` and `error.ref-like-name-not-Ref.js`, and
	// they are a matched pair with two clean fixtures that differ only in the variable's name.
	// False positives are unmoved at 11, `under` holds at 0 fixtures / 0 scopes, and the dependency
	// oracle is byte-identical at 74 matched with ours 119.
	//
	// 28 once a ref's STABILITY is seeded only by a hook call, separately from its shape. The one
	// that closes is `error.preserve-use-memo-ref-missing-reactive.ts`, whose `ref` is a phi of two
	// `useRef` results and is named `ref`. False positives hold at 11, `under` at 0 fixtures / 0
	// scopes, and the dependency oracle is byte-identical at 74 matched with ours 119. Memo blocks
	// improve: 20 all-empty to 17 and 7 contradicted to 5.
	//
	// 29 once an alias into a named binding stops resolving through, in
	// `drop_manual_memoization.go`. The one that closes is
	// `useCallback-alias-property-load-dep.ts`, where `const x = propB.x.y` is written as
	// `[propA.x, x]`: the written `x` was resolving to `propB.x.y` while the inferred side kept
	// `x`, so the two could never match. False positives hold at 11, `under` at 0 fixtures / 0
	// scopes, and both other oracles are byte-identical.
	//
	// 28 with the local zero-argument callee resolution in `effects.go`, and the one that leaves is
	// `error.false-positive-useMemo-dropped-infer-always-invalidating.ts`, whose own header says
	// what it is: "This is technically a false positive as the useMemo in source was effectively a
	// no-op". Upstream reports it and calls the report a mistake, which is the same reasoning
	// already recorded above for the two `todo` fixtures.
	//
	// Taken because the trade is measured and one-sided everywhere else: false positives 11 to 8
	// with three real fixtures closing and none added, dependency `matched` 74 to 75 -- a golden row
	// GAINED on the strongest oracle -- and `under` held at 0 fixtures / 0 scopes.

// # It took three attempts to define this population, and the first two are why the number is pinned

// The first spelling took every fixture whose `Expected.Raw` lacks this rule's message and which

// The filter was wrong: `Expectation` parses only the `## Error` block, so `Raw` is empty for every
// fixture expecting clean output, and the complement was made almost entirely of error fixtures for
// other rules. Firing on those is not obviously wrong.
//
// The second concluded the corpus held zero fixtures that use manual memoization and expect no error
// at all, and therefore that this rule's over-reporting could not be measured here. That was true of
// the corpus and false about the cause: `Load` rejected every fixture not named `error.*`, so the
// tree was error-only by construction. Upstream ships 70 of these. The loader excluded them, and the

//
// So the rate is now a real measurement rather than an upper bound, and it is high: 31 of 70. The

	// exactly the three whose subject they are: `object-keys`, `object-values` and
	// `repro-object-fromEntries-entries`, all now silent.
	// The DENOMINATOR moved from 70 to 69 without this number moving, which is worth stating

	// excluded: upstream reports this rule on it, in `## Logs` rather than in a `## Error` section,
	// so it was counted as clean while both compilers agree it is a violation. It was not firing
	// under the current gate, so 27 is unchanged; ungated it was one of the false positives and is

	// Raised from 27 by the same change, and the cost is exactly one fixture:
	// `useCallback-alias-property-load-dep.ts`. Traced to a scope boundary rather than to the
	// comparison -- `const x = propB.x.y` is declared inside our scope 1, so `checkValidDependency`
	// rejects `x` on the rule this tree shares with upstream verbatim
	// (`decl.order < scopeRange.Start`), while upstream's scope begins after that declaration and
	// names `x` in its compiled output. That belongs to the scope work.
	//
	// Four true positives for one false positive is the first net-positive reading this trade has
	// ever had. It was plus six for thirteen when the ungating task was re-measured, and every step
	// between is recorded on that task.
	// Raised from 28 by the change described at `knownTruePositives`, and the cost is one fixture
	// family rather than three defects:
	//
	//	useMemo-conditional-access-alloc.ts
	//	useMemo-conditional-access-noAlloc.ts
	//	useMemo-conditional-access-own-scope.ts

	// driven by `Optional` terminals this lowering does not produce. The refusal is correct and the
	// route around it is missing, which is the gap already recorded at that arm.
	//
	// `own-scope` is also the single row the dependency oracle loses in this change, `propB.x.y`,
	// so that oracle's fall and one of these three are the same fixture rather than two findings.
	//
	// Six true positives for three false positives, with `under` in the scope oracle unmoved at
	// 5 fixtures / 7 scopes and the corpus depth distribution moving 595 to 574 rather than
	// collapsing the way every truncation attempt on this cluster did.
	// Lowered from 31 by exempting a dependency whose scope the walk never entered. See the note at

	// Lowered from 25 by exempting a component or hook parameter from the dependency condition. See

	// and upstream's own comment calls this an edge case of mutable range inference.
