// It exposes two things the graph already computed and threw away: the predecessor edges that
// `findFinalPathDominators` built into a scratch array, and the immediate-dominator array that
// same function wrote and dropped after reading one chain out of it.
//
// # Why this is an addition rather than a rewrite of paths.go
//
// `findFinalPathDominators` is a correct Cooper-Harvey-Kennedy implementation and it is load-
// bearing for `PathAnalysis.IsOnEveryFinalPath`, which `rules_of_hooks` consumes. Editing it to
// hand its array outward would put a second caller's requirements on a function whose current
// caller needs one boolean per block, and the two want different graphs: it dominates over a graph
// with ONE SYNTHETIC EXIT reached only by non-throwing final blocks, deliberately excluding thrown
// exits, because that is the question ESLint asks. A consumer asking "what dominates this block" in
// general does not want thrown paths excluded.
//
// So the algorithm is written a second time here over the real successor graph, and the two are
// pinned against each other by `TestDominatorsAgreeWithFinalPathDominators`. That test is the
// reason duplicating it is safe rather than a divergence waiting to happen: if either drifts, it
// goes red.

// Predecessors returns the reachable blocks with an edge into block, in Blocks order.
//
// The graph stores only successors, because that is the direction the builder lays edges down in.
// Every backward analysis needs the other direction, and every consumer that has needed it so far
// has rebuilt it: `findFinalPathDominators` builds a counting-sorted predecessor array and discards
// it, and the liveness solver in `no-useless-assignment` avoids needing one only by iterating every
// block every round.
//
// The result is computed once by `AnalyzeDominators` and shared, so this is a slice read rather
// than a walk. It is owned by the analysis and must not be mutated: two callers see the same slice.
//
// Unreachable blocks have no predecessors here even when a successor edge points at them. That
// mirrors what every existing consumer already does — each one skips `!successor.Reachable` at its
// own loop — and it is the definition dominance needs, since a block nothing arrives at cannot
// dominate anything.

// DominatorAnalysis holds the dominator tree of one graph's reachable subgraph, plus the

//
// It is separate from PathAnalysis rather than folded into it because the two answer different
// questions over different graphs. PathAnalysis dominates over a graph with a synthetic exit and no
// thrown edges, to answer "is this on every non-throwing final path". This dominates over the real
// reachable successor graph, to answer "does control have to pass through A to reach B". A consumer
