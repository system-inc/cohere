// Package arena hands out values from chunks of memory that are kept and reused, for the trees a format
// builds and drops one file at a time (#93dpede).
//
// Formatting allocates a parse's worth of tokens and nodes for every file, and with the collector off (the
// policy cohere runs under) none of it is reclaimed: every file's tree is new memory. A tree whose values
// all die when its file is done can take them from an Arena instead, and Reset hands the same memory to
// the next file. An Arena belongs to one goroutine at a time; formatters keep theirs in a sync.Pool.
//
// Under the cohere_poison build tag, Reset fills every value it releases with the arena's Poison, so a
// value read after its file was done changes the output, or stops it, where the corpus tests see it.
