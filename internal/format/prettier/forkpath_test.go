/*
 * The fork was reachable by two independent paths and only one of them was overridable.
 *
 * `internal/release` resolved COHERE_PRETTIER_FORK to decide which bundles it vouched for, while
 * this engine read a hardcoded constant to decide which bundles it loaded. Neither consulted the
 * other, so a machine that set the variable got a release guard reporting green about a directory
 * nothing loaded from, and an engine still reading a home directory on one laptop.
 *
 * The defect was not that either path was wrong. It was that they existed separately. These tests
 * hold the seam closed from both directions, because the failure was silent in both: the override
 * that did not reach the loader, and the default that quietly worked anyway so nobody noticed.

// the original defect again.
//
// The default path is no longer shared, and that is deliberate rather than a regression. The engine
// has no path-shaped default any more, so `release` declaring its own is two different questions
// rather than one value with two homes. Only that file still asks the path-shaped one, and only
// until its guard is reshaped to vouch for embedded bytes.

// It lives here rather than in `release` because `prettier` imports nothing internal, so this
