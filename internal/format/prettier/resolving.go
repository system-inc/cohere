// Resolving formats each file with the options Prettier would resolve for that file.
//
// The format phase used to build one Engine from DefaultOptions, ahra's block, and run it over
// whatever repository cohere was pointed at. That formatted api-phi-health with the wrong
// bracketSameLine, which a differential measured as 41 files "rewritten" that are in fact a fixed point
// of their own configuration. Formatting a repository with another repository's options is a bug,
// not a default.
//
// So resolution is per file, from the file's own directory, as Prettier's own resolution is. It does
// not depend on the caller having walked the tree first, or on the tree having one config, both of
// which would be true of our repositories today and would quietly stop being true when one grows a
// nested config.
//
// Engines are built per distinct set of options and kept, so a repository with one config pays for
// one engine. The parser table is independent of options, which is why Handles and Enumerate need no
// resolution at all.
