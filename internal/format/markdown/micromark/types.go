// Package micromark is micromark 4, the markdown tokenizer Prettier's markdown parser runs, ported to Go.
//
// The fork parses `.md` with mdast-util-from-markdown over micromark, with the GFM, math, wiki-link and
// liquid extensions and an html-text override (src/language-markdown/parse/parse-markdown.js). The printer
// slices the original text by the offsets this tokenizer records, so a CommonMark library that builds a
// similar tree is not a substitute: the tree has to be this tree, position for position.
//
// # A port, not a reimplementation
//
// Each file follows one upstream file, state for state, and names its source. The state machines are
// closures in JavaScript and closures here. Where JavaScript semantics leak into behavior, the Go copies
// the semantics rather than the intent:
//
//   - Text is UTF-16 code units, the way JavaScript strings are. Offsets and columns count code units, the
//     printer slices by them, and the character classes test single code units, so an astral symbol
//     beside an asterisk is two non-punctuation units here exactly as it is upstream.
//   - The end of input is JavaScript's null. Upstream compares it with < and >, where null is 0, and a
//     real NUL never reaches a tokenizer because preprocessing replaces it, so CodeEof is 0.
//   - The interrupt factory hands constructs an object whose prototype is the tokenizer context. Self
//     reproduces that binding: reads are live, and a write lands on the view when there is one.
