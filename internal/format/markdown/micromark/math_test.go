// (`<`), definition, list, liquid (`{{`, `{%`), wiki-link (`[[`), strikethrough (`~`), table (`|`),
// footnote or GFM autolink literal (`www.`, `http`, `@`) syntax: those constructs are still pending, so a
// fixture leaning on them would differ for reasons that are not math's. Neither CommonMark nor GFM has
// spec examples for math, so the first group is micromark-extension-math's readme and test examples
// that stay inside ported constructs.
