// Package differential measures a candidate formatter against the Prettier fork, byte for byte, over
// real corpora.
//
// It exists because cohere is replacing Prettier with a native printer, and "byte-identical on our
// code" is a claim no amount of reading either implementation can establish. The acceptance test is
// this package's number reaching 100% on every corpus we own. Until then the number is the progress
// report, so the instrument has to be right before anything is measured with it.
//
// # The oracle is goja(file), not file
//
// The predecessor of this harness (internal/format/comparison) treated every tree file as a fixed point
// of Prettier, so any change a candidate proposed was a divergence. That no longer holds. The projects
// run Prettier with prettier-plugin-tailwindcss, and the embedded engine runs core Prettier without
// it, so the tree is a fixed point of a different formatter than the one being matched. Class order is
// cohere's lint fixer's job, not the format phase's. So the oracle output is computed, never assumed.
//
// # Two numbers, because one of them flatters
//
// The corpora are almost entirely already formatted. A candidate that returns its input unchanged
// matches every file the oracle leaves alone and would report a high overall score while having no
// line-breaking engine at all. So every tally carries the subset the oracle actually rewrites, and the
// identity rate on that subset is reported separately. That subset is where formatting ability shows;
// the rest only proves a candidate does not break formatted code.
//
// # What never counts as a match
//
// A candidate that refuses a file, or errors on it, has not produced the oracle's bytes. Refusal is a
// separate outcome so it is visible, and it sits in the denominator. A file the oracle itself cannot
// format (a genuine parse error in the tree) has no right answer to match, so it leaves the denominator
// but is counted and named, never dropped silently.
