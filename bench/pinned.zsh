# What the benchmarks in this directory share: a copy of a project pinned to its commits, the one
# cohere engine every run uses, the machine's load, and a timer that waits for a run's last process.
# Sourced, not run. The sourcing script sets `name` (for its messages), `project`, `work`, `cohere`,
# `ceiling` and `settle` first.
#
# The copy. The project's committed tree is extracted (its submodules too, each at the commit the
# parent records) into the work directory, and the project's node_modules are linked in rather than
# copied. So the input is named by commits, not by whatever was on disk, nothing another session is
# editing can move a number, and the project's own caches are never read or written. A copy is reused
# by later invocations at the same commits, and refused if its files no longer match what was extracted.
#
# The engine. The launcher rebuilds whenever a cohere commit lands, which during a working session is
# every few minutes, so a benchmark run through it can measure two binaries and report one number. The
# engine the launcher resolves at the start is copied beside the logs and run directly.
