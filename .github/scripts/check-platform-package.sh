#     check-platform-package.sh <platform>
#     check-platform-package.sh win32-x64
#
# Written for Windows, the platform nobody had run (#0kfa508), and taking the platform as an argument so
# the same script runs on a Mac against darwin-arm64, which is how it was tested before Windows ran it.
# Run from the directory holding ./dist, as release.yml leaves it.
#
# Both packages are packed and installed with npm into a project of their own, so the run goes through
# what a user's install gives them: npm's shim in node_modules/.bin, the Node launcher, and the platform
# binary it finds. Every case runs in a fresh copy of the project, so no case passes on what an earlier
# one wrote. The full `go test` suite is not run here: many of its tests use /bin/sh, symlinks and
# `/`-absolute fixtures, and that is stated rather than hidden (#0kfa508).
