// The Swift engine compiles policy in rather than reading it at run time: a released engine has no
// checkout beside it, and a file the front door hands it is one more thing that can go missing between
// the two. So each policy file Swift reads becomes a generated Swift source holding the file's bytes
// verbatim, which the engine parses exactly as it would have parsed the file.
//
// The generated files are checked in, written by `go run ./policy/tools/generate`, rather than made by a
// SwiftPM build plugin. Measured 2026-10-03 (#2cqemcd) on a probe package that compiles in
// Abbreviations.json: the plugin worked, reading the file from outside the package, and cost 4.1s on a
// cold build (its generator is a second executable) and 0.19s on every no-op build. A checked-in file
// costs neither, builds the same under every build system and toolchain the release supports, and can be
// read and searched like any other source. What it costs is a copy that can go stale, so both engines
// test it: TestSwiftFilesAreCurrent here, and the Swift tests compare the compiled-in bytes with the file
// on disk.

// swiftSource is a Swift enum whose `file` is the policy file's text, byte for byte.
//
// The text sits in a multi-line raw string, so nothing in it is escaped and the generated file reads as
// the JSON it carries. Two things could make the string differ from the file, and each is ruled out:
//   - A raw string ends at `"""` followed by its own number of `#`, and treats `\` followed by that many as
//     an escape. The delimiter takes one more `#` than the longest run in the text, so neither can occur.
//   - A multi-line literal reads every line ending as `\n`. A file with a carriage return is refused rather
//     than changed.
//
// Every line is written in the house format, so the engine's own format check passes the file as
// generated: each line of text indented to the closing delimiter, which Swift strips from every line, and
// an empty line left empty, which Swift allows. The line break before the delimiter is not part of the
// string, so one is written after the text, and the text ends as the file ends, final newline or not.
