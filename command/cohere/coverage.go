// Coverage, said as counts a reader can check rather than as a wall.
//
// Every printer that used to live here exists because a silent gap once shipped: four rules in the
// gate this replaces were dead for months under a green run, a rule turned off across a directory read
// exactly like a rule with nothing to report, and forty withheld findings printed the same green as
// none. The doctrine stands: a run that checked nothing must never look like a run that found nothing.
//
// What changed is the shape. A clean run on ahra printed about 170 notes, a rule nobody configured
// printed twice ("offered no files" and "not in the config"), and a rule the config turned off printed
// twice ("offered no files" and "scoped off for 3785 files"). A reader skims 170 lines and learns
// nothing, which is the same failure as printing nothing: the line that matters drowns. So every rule
// lands in exactly one category, the categories are counted on one line whose terms add up to the rule
// total, and each rule is named once, under its category, behind `--coverage`. What needs action
// prints in full by default whatever the mode: findings, crashed and unreadable files, config keys that
// match no rule, reasonless suppressions, the parity line, and a rule that registered nothing when it
// should have. See `ahra tasks show psj5k5q`.

// coverageCategory is the one coverage fact that describes a rule. Every rule lands in exactly one,
// which is what lets the counts add up and what keeps a rule from being described twice.
