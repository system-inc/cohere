// A file with directives replays from the findings cache, and its directives are counted exactly as a run with no
// cache counts them (#kdee854). Such a file was never cached, since a directive's accounting spans cached and walked
// rules alike, so on ahra 84 files were walked by every rule on every edit run. Its entry now keeps which directive
// withheld each cacheable rule's finding, and a replay marks those directives applied for the rules it replays.
//
// Use.ts holds a blanket directive over a line where a pure rule (no-debugger) and type-aware rules both report,
// so one directive silences findings from two classes. Other.ts holds one whose findings all come from type-aware
// rules, and Dead.ts one naming a rule that finds nothing there, which is dead however that rule's verdict arrived. Value.ts, which both import, then changes twice: to `string | null`, which re-runs the type-aware class
// while the pure class replays, and to `string | number`, after which Other.ts's directive silences nothing. Every
// step is held to a run with no cache: the same findings, suppression counts and dead directives, and --explain
// prints the same accounting. Deleting a directive is noticed.
