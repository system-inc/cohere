// Discovery is how one cohere checks a repository that holds more than one project: TypeScript programs
// and Swift packages side by side, or nested below one another (#f9nftxz). From the root it walks every
// directory the repository keeps, and each tsconfig.json or Package.swift it meets is a project, run by
// its own engine.
//
// What the walk never enters is the whole of its correctness, since the markers are everywhere a
// repository keeps other people's code:
//
//   - Whatever .gitignore ignores where cohere runs (Kirk, 2026-10-04: "if its gitignored where you run
//     cohere we skip it"). Ignored means not this repository's: ahra ignores every clone under
//     projects/, and each of those has its own gate.
//   - node_modules, .build, .cache, .git and Go's testdata, ignored or not. node_modules holds packages'
//     tsconfig.json files, cohere's own swift/.build/checkouts holds dozens of SwiftPM checkouts with a
//     Package.swift each, and testdata holds fixtures, tsconfigs among them.
//   - A directory with a repository of its own, a clone or a submodule. Its projects are its own to
//     discover, and one inside a program, such as Structure or Base, is checked as part of that program,
//     its drift reported read-only, as it always was.
//
// A marker the root's ignorePatterns match is refused rather than run, and named.
