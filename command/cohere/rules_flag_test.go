// A development build implements whatever was on disk when it was compiled, which in a shared
// worktree includes other authors' uncommitted work. On one night three people read a count off
// this surface and reported it as the repository's; `-version` had carried the disclosure the whole
// time and nobody ran it. A disclosure one command to the side is a disclosure that gets skipped,
// so it has to travel with the number a reader carries away.
//
// The split matters as much as the note. The list stays on stdout so two binaries can still be
// diffed directly, and the note goes to stderr so it cannot corrupt that diff.
