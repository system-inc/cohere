//
// Before it existed the refusal was the walk's "nothing to walk: the file set is empty (the program
// holds N files)", measured on ahra for `--lint modules/tasks/data/attachments/pt64fq7/score.mjs`,
// a file the tsconfig excludes and .gitignore leaves out. Nothing said which. Each row is one of the
// three reasons, and the gitignore rows assert the line and pattern come through, with no git
// repository at all: the clause is read from the file.
