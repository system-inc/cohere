// the program can see, and an install changes every consumer of a package without touching a

// that is SHORTER never can. `typescript/no-base-to-string` cannot reach a rule registered as
// `@typescript-eslint/no-base-to-string`: there is no prefix to trim, only one to add.

// Left silent, this reads as the opposite of what happened. The rule reports "nobody has said
// whether it should run" while someone did say, in the config, in a key sitting three lines above
// one that works. A deliberate `off` that stops applying is worse than one that was never written,
// because the config still shows the decision and the run no longer honors it.
