// earlyFormat is a bare run's format pass begun before the graph is built (#g3046x5).
//
// Traced on ahra, cold: in the 540ms before the walk, about 6.3 of the 8.6 CPU-seconds the cores could give
// went unused, since discovery, the tsconfig's enumeration and the program's file loads are bound by the
// kernel rather than the CPU. Begun here, about 2.6 of formatting's 5.8 CPU-seconds are done before the walk
// and none after it, against 1.35 after it before: about 0.06s of a cold run's wall, measured. It is not more
// because the early pass's own file opens wait on the same kernel path as the program's. Formatting needs no program, only each file's bytes and the options its
// directory resolves to, so the speculation the fix phase starts with the walk can start here instead, on
// every idle core, and narrow to its usual share when the walk begins. What it computes is judged exactly as
// before: keepable discards any attempt the walk proposed a fix for, or whose bytes the walk read differently.
//
// Only the scope is computed off the main goroutine. Declaring the walk's inputs to the run cache, or declining
// it, stays on the main goroutine where the scope is taken (formatScopeOf), as it always was.
