 * `nexus/import-require-path-alias` must not go dark because of where the config was written.
 *
 * The rule took its repositoryRoot as written. ahra committed `/Users/kirkouimet/Projects/ahra`, and
 * in every worktree and on every other machine no checked file was under it, so the rule declined
 * every file and the run printed the same thing a tree with no deep imports prints. A relative root
 * was worse: it never matched an absolute file name at all.
 *
 * These run the real binary from a directory below the project, so a root resolved against the
 * process's working directory would land in the wrong place and the finding would vanish.
