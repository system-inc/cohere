// formatScope is which files the format phase considers, and how that set was decided.
//
// The scope began as a necessity: the goja formatter ran 83 to 100ms per file, so ahra's whole tree
// was minutes against a lint phase of 392ms. The native printers format that tree in about 10
// seconds, so the scope is now about relevance rather than survival. Actual churn on this tree is
// one file per commit and 35 across five, so scoping to changed files puts the common case in
// milliseconds and formats only what the caller touched.
//
// The set is named as well as computed, because named paths, the whole tree, and the files not on
// record as formatted are three different answers to "what is formatted" and a reader cannot tell
// which one they got from the file count alone. The last is the default; see format_record.go.
type formatScope struct {
	// FileNames is the absolute paths in scope, sorted. Nil means every file is in scope.

	//
	// The transform asks about every project file, so a linear scan here would be quadratic across
	// the tree: 3,407 files against a few hundred changed ones is a million comparisons to answer a
	// question a map answers in one.

	RequestDescription string

	// recorded, when set, says a file outside the scope is out only because the format record vouches
	// for its bytes, and answers whether a given text is still those bytes. A fix that rewrites such a
