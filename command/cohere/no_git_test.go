// TestCohereRunsNoGit holds that cohere runs no git process on any path, and that what it reports does
// not depend on whether git is there.
//
// Git was how cohere learned what changed. It is gone: what changed is what the format record does not
// hold (format_record.go), a nested repository is a `.git` on disk, and an ignore line is read from the
// file. The proof is two runs of the same sequence. One has a `git` on PATH that writes every
// invocation to a log and fails, so any call, even one whose failure is swallowed, leaves a line. The
// other has the real PATH. The log must be empty, and the two transcripts must be the same.
//
// The sequence is also the end-to-end check of the default format scope: an edited file is formatted,
// an unedited one is not, a file edited and put back is unchanged, a deleted file drops out, a new
// untracked one is seen, a declared submodule is walked, and a clone nobody declared is left alone.
