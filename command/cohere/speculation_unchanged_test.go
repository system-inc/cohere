// The speculation formats a file from the program's own copy, reading nothing, when the content pack's stat
// says that copy is still the file's, and reads the disk when it is not (#q6dey77). Both halves on a real
// program read through a real pack:
//
// An unchanged file's kept result is the program's text itself, the same bytes in the same memory, so it was
// never read again. Rereading every file to compare it with the program's was 51 MB on a cold ahra run.
//
// A file edited after the program read it, the walk's read, is read from the disk, its result is of the new
// bytes, and keepable discards it, since those are not the bytes the walk's findings are about. The edit is
// formatted, so the speculation keeps whichever copy it formats and only the stat can tell it the program's
// copy is stale: without the stat check, the stale copy is kept as formatted and the edit goes unnoticed.
//
// Both with a content pack and without one: a `--no-cache` run has none, and the program then keeps the stats
// it read under itself. The 51 MB was measured on that run.
