// formatClock measures how much of the fix phase's wall clock had a format in flight, which the footer's
// --phases shows as 💅 beside 🪄.
//
// The two are not separate phases. A file is fixed to its fixpoint and then formatted, by several workers
// at once, so fixing and formatting interleave across the tree. Summing each call's time would count four
// workers formatting for a second as four seconds, past the phase's own wall clock. What is measured
// instead is the time during which at least one format was running: every moment of the phase is either
// that or not, so 💅 and 🪄 partition the phase and add up to it. A moment where one worker formats while
// another fixes is billed to 💅, which is the side a reader asking "is the formatter slow?" wants it on.
