// Ownership is how a repository with many TypeScript programs gets one report with each file in it once
// (#wvgxtey). Discovery finds every tsconfig.json; this reads each one and decides three things.
//
//   - A solution root, a tsconfig that includes no file and references others (`files: []` plus
//     references, as `tsc --init` monorepos and Vite's template write it), is not a project: there is
//     nothing in it to check. The tsconfigs it references are, whatever they are named, so they join the
//     projects found, which is how Vite's tsconfig.app.json and tsconfig.node.json are checked.
//   - Each file belongs to the nearest tsconfig that includes it: of the projects whose tsconfig includes
//     it, the deepest whose directory holds the file; if none holds it, the one whose directory shares the
//     longest path with it; ties in discovery order. That is the editor's rule, since TypeScript's
//     language server opens a file under the nearest tsconfig.json up its directory chain that includes
//     it, so cohere and the editor judge a file by the same options. The other projects that include it
//     yield it: it stays in their programs, where their type questions still need it, and they neither
//     lint it nor report its diagnostics. A project left with no file of its own is not run.
//   - Formatting goes by directory: a project's format walk leaves out the directories of the projects
//     below it, whose own runs format them, so two runs never write one file.
//
// One TypeScript project reads nothing: there is nothing to share, and the run keeps the cost it had.
