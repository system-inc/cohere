// applyProposedFixes rewrites every file whose rules proposed a repair, and reports what it did.
//
// Each file converges on its own rather than the tree converging as a whole. A fix is local to the
// file it edits, so a per-file fixpoint reaches the same result as a whole-tree loop while re-linting
// only the files that actually changed — and it means one pathological file cannot force every other
// file through another pass.
//
// Only files with at least one proposal are considered. A file nobody proposed anything for is never
// opened, never re-parsed, and never written, which is what keeps a fix run proportional to the work
// rather than to the tree.
//
// With write false this is `--no-fix`: every file goes through the same fixpoint and transform and
// nothing reaches the disk, so the summary is what a writing run would do, stated as what would
// change. One function with a switch rather than a second copy, because a check that decided
// anything differently from the write would report a tree as clean that `--fix` then rewrites.
