//  1. an edit happens

//  3. type check       bails here, alone and loudly
//  4. lint             only reachable once the code means something
//
// Mutation runs first so everything downstream sees the repaired tree: reporting a finding a fixer
// would have silently repaired wastes the reader's attention. Types gate lint because findings
// against wrong semantics are noise a reader has to re-read after fixing the real problem — one type
// error alone at the top beats one type error buried under a hundred style findings in a file that
// does not compile.
//  5. unused           a report, opt-in, and never part of the gate
//
// Unused runs last and only when asked for. It is the one phase a bare `cohere` does not run, and
// that break from the other three is deliberate: the first three answer "is this correct", which
// nobody should have to opt into, while unused answers "is this still wanted", which is a question
// with no right answer that a build can enforce. An export held for an external consumer is unused
// and correct. So it reports, it never fails a build on its own account, and it stays out of the
// way of the gate people run a hundred times a day.
//
// It runs after types for a hard reason rather than a tidy one. The reference analysis is keyed on
// symbol identity, and a tree that does not type-check has unresolved symbols, which read as
// "nothing references this". Reporting live code as unused because the build was broken is the
// failure mode that gets a report closed and never reopened, so the phase states loudly when it ran
// without a clean type check rather than quietly producing a longer list.
