/*
 * What a run checks and what it may write are two different sets.
 *
 * A named path is checked together with everything that imports it, because a change to an exported
 * type breaks its consumers and a check that stopped at the named file would miss those findings.
 * Above the closure limit the whole tree is checked. Both widenings are about seeing more, and both
 * are honest when the coverage line says so.
 *
 * Writing is not seeing. The fix phase used to rewrite every file the checked set handed it, so
 * `cohere --fix app` in www-phi-health reached past 500 files, fell back to the whole tree, and
 * rewrote 15 files inside libraries/structure and 2 inside its nested nexus, none of them named.
 * The caller said which files this run is about; widening the check must never widen that.
 *
 * Every case puts the same fixable violation in a file that was named and in one that was not, so
 * the named file changing is the control that proves the fixer ran, and the other staying
 * byte-identical is the boundary.
