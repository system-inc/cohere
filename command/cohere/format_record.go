// The format record: which bytes cohere has already seen formatted, so a run formats what changed
// since cohere last looked rather than what git says changed since the last commit.
//
// The scope used to be git's answer: working tree, staged and untracked, asked of every submodule in
// turn. That was a dozen subprocesses on ahra and the largest single cost outside the phases, and it
// answered a neighbouring question. A file committed unformatted was never in it, so it was never
// formatted and never reported, and a file edited and committed between two runs was never formatted
// either. The record answers the question the format phase actually has: are these bytes already known
// to be formatted?
//
// # What an entry proves
//
// An entry is the hash of a text the formatter returned unchanged, which is what formatTransform hands
// back: it formats until a pass changes nothing. So a file whose bytes hash to an entry is a fixed point
// of the formatter under the options it was recorded with, and formatting it again would change
// nothing. That holds whether or not the text was ever written. A `--no-fix` run over an unformatted
// file records the formatted text, the disk still holds the old bytes, the hashes differ, and the file
// stays in scope and keeps being reported. Nothing about the write has to be trusted.
//
// # What makes the record say nothing
//
// The record is a section of the project's cache table (see run_cache.go), keyed by the formatter's
// identity: a hash of the printers and everything they import, the pass loop, and the toolchain,
// stamped at build time. A cohere whose formatter changed starts with an empty record and formats every
// file once; one that changed only a lint rule keeps it. Each entry carries the options its file formats with, so a config edit sends exactly the
// files it reaches back through the formatter. Any doubt, an unreadable record, a version it does not
// know, is an empty record: the cost is one run that formats everything, never a file skipped on a
// guess.
//
// # Reading it cheaply
//
// An entry also holds the size and modification time its file had when its bytes were last read and
// matched, so an unchanged file is a stat rather than a read. That is the same trade the run cache
// makes, and it is stated in the same words there (see program.RunCache): a file whose bytes change
// while its size and nanosecond modification time do not is invisible to it.
