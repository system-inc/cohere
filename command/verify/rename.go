// renameVerbName is the subcommand that triggers a program-wide rename.
//
// A verb rather than a flag, and that separation is the design rather than a naming preference. Every
// other write in this tool is a fix: a rule found something wrong, the repair is scoped to the file
// the rule was looking at, and `--fix` runs by DEFAULT because a fix is meaning-preserving by
// construction. A rename is none of those things. Nothing is wrong with the code, the user is
// asserting an intention rather than accepting a repair, and the blast radius is wherever the symbol
// lives. Folding it into `--fix` would mean a flag whose default is on could rewrite a symbol across
// six files because of an argument somewhere else on the command line.
const renameVerbName = "rename"

// runRenameVerb handles `verify rename <target> <newName>`.
//
// # Why the dry run is the default here when --fix is the default everywhere else
//
// The two defaults point opposite ways on purpose, and the asymmetry is the argument. `--fix`
// defaults to on because a fix is reactive and bounded: a rule already decided the edit was safe,
// the change is confined to a file the rule examined, and the engine's parse guard plus the type
// phase on the same run catch what is left. Nothing about running the gate is a statement of
// intent, so the tool doing the obvious repair is a service rather than a surprise.
//
// A rename inverts every one of those. It is imperative rather than reactive, so the tool has no
// independent judgment that the edit is correct — the user's assertion IS the justification. It is
// unbounded, reaching every file that mentions the symbol. And its characteristic failure is silent:
// `internal/rule/rule.go` records a shipped case where a rename updated a usage, missed its
// declaration, and produced a file that parsed while failing to compile. A rename that is subtly
// wrong is not caught by the parse guard, and the half-renamed tree is exactly the state this
// project exists to make impossible.
//
// So the safe default is inverted: the plan is computed and printed in full, and `--write` is the
// separate affirmative act that applies it. The cost is one extra command on a rename someone
// already knew they wanted. The alternative cost is a tree rewritten by a command whose preview
// nobody read, and those are not comparable.
