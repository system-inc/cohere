// Package incremental re-exports typescript-go's incremental build machinery.
//
// Hand-written rather than generated, for the same reason the parser and format shims are:
// tools/generate_shims covers the packages a headless linter needed, and incremental was not among
// them because a linter that always checks everything has no use for change detection.
//
// Note this is internal/execute/incremental, which lives inside the CLI driver rather than
// beside the compiler. That placement is the reason it was easy to miss: a search for
// internal/incremental finds nothing.
//
// What this buys, measured on the ahra tree rather than assumed: tsgo --noEmit --incremental
// costs 2.11s cold and 0.85s warm, so the mechanism is worth ~1.26s to the compiler that
// ships it. What it does NOT buy is a warm program. ReadBuildInfoProgram returns a *Program
// whose `program` field is nil (incremental.go:44-62), GetProgram panics on that path
// (program.go:110), and upstream calls compiler.NewProgram unconditionally right after
// reading the build info (tsc.go:304-310). The build info is a change-detection input, not a
// graph you load instead of building.
//
// One thing that looks alarming and is not, because the first version of this comment got it
// backwards and a reader deserves the corrected form rather than the scary one.
//
// The build info our tree produces carries no semanticDiagnosticsPerFile at all, and neither
// does one from a fresh --noEmit --incremental run: verified on two artifacts, both with
// fileNames 9,982 matching program size. That is normal, and it does not mean the cache is
// inert.
//
// The skip does not replay stored diagnostics. It runs on content hashes. On load,
// setSemanticDiagnostics (buildinfotosnapshot.go:152-159) seeds an empty "no diagnostics"
// entry for every file NOT in changedFilesSet, and changedFilesSet is computed by comparing
// each file's hash against oldFileInfo.version (programtosnapshot.go:104-110). Then
// collectSemanticDiagnosticsOfAffectedFiles (program.go:290-303) checks only files missing
// from that map. So an unchanged file is seeded clean and never re-checked, which is where
// the 2.11s to 0.85s comes from.
//
// The practical consequence for a caller: do not treat an empty semanticDiagnosticsPerFile as
// a cold cache, and do not go looking for stored diagnostics to replay. Hand the machinery a
// build info and a freshly built program, and the signatures do the work.
